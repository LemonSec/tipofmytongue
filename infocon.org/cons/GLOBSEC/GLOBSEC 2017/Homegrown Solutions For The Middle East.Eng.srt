solutions for the Middle East if we're

00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,300
looking for solutions what is the

8
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,269
problem we don't need more proof and yet

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,699
proof comes with every day today with an

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,270
the so-called Islamic state - Isis ISIL

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:17,430
whatever you call them it is a threat

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,979
which is truly global today we want to

18
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,210
focus on the sharp end of this threat

19
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,979
and we've been reminded of the

20
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,889
accelerating campaign to fight against -

21
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,500

control in Iraq and Syria is we are told

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:50,759
approaching its last phases the most

27
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,789
difficult the most dangerous who will

28
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,619
fight these battles who we rebuild after

29
00:01:53,789 --> 00:02:01,229
- is pushed out and can we be certain

30
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:04,799
that there will not be a son of - or a

31
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:08,550
daughter of - how can the region held by

32
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,610
its allies prevent that and who will pay

33
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,470
for the reconstruction these are the

grant solutions for the Middle East yes

94
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:49,140
when you look at the impacts of this

95
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:52,680
those problems regional problems its

96
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,200
global migration and refugee problem and

97
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,240
terror

98
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,539
Jim became global problem and also needs

99
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,480
global response but local and regional

100
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:05,340
ownership the to overcome the problems

101
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,720
is important fighting - is important but

102
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,609
political solution is also equally

103
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,470
important so we need to pay attention

104
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,400
both of them at the same time

105
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,680
simultaneously and euphrates operation

106
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,469
Euphrates shields prove how we can

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,050
defeat - this is the Turkish leader /

108
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,200
yes and Turkish troops with the support

109
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,980
of Turkish - with the local forces and

110
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:33,930
now the local authorities are running

111
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:37,210
all these cities clear from - el Bob

112
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:40,570
jarabulus right Doug and the other

113
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,880
cities and already 60,000 refugees from

114
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,040
Turkey went back to do citizens because

115
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,640
they feel themselves safe because of the

116
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,350
local ownership of this town so we can

117
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,570
quickly defeat this terrorist

118
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,760
organization but we need a predetermined

119
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,159
strategy without oriented strategy and

120
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,909
we need to mobilize the right groups

121
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,750
right people and we also have to plan

122
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,130
the post

123
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:09,970
- era in those areas we can defeat - in

124
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:13,180
Raqqa easily we can defeat - in mussel

125
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:17,680
boat in Syria and I mean Iraq generally

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:19,600
but we need to have that predetermined

127
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,150
result oriented strategy and we need to

128
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,550
work with the right groups there are 68

129
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,229
countries in the coalition against I

130
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,880
let's let's I want to focus it because

131
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,380
we're among friends here we don't need

132
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,820
to tell anyone everyone here knows

133
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,800
what's happening on the ground and we

134
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,599
know your concerns you see the right

135
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,120
forces the United States has decided

136
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,670
that the right forces include the Syrian

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,150
democratic forces which include the YPG

138
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:45,160
the Syrian Kurdish forces the United

139
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,570
States has reassured turkey a NATO ally

140
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,580
that even though the Syrian Kurdish

141
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,560
forces will take part in the battle for

142
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,810
Raqqa they will also protect your

143
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,210
security has president Trump and

144
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,100
everyone else convinced you of that you

145
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,799
know we are not convinced we still

146
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,990
disagrees how can we convince I mean

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,300
it's not only about Turkey abut it's not

148
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,010
only a security matter for Turkey but it

149
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,790
is also very important about the feature

150
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,909
of

151
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:12,250
Syria I mean if we decide if we have

152
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,170
decided to divide the country it's okay

153
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,570
this is what we have been telling to our

154
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,670
American friends but when we put this

155
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,950
question to Russian the Iranians and the

156
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,680
others they are all for the territorial

157
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,300
integrity of the country why we'd have

158
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,330
to divide the country if for example

159
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,460
they now have set up a council which we

160
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,620
includes Sunni Arabs which make up the

161
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,049
majority of the pre-war population of

162
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,180
Raqqa there will also be some Kurds on

163
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:42,280
my project that is the cosmetic one that

164
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:44,620
is not the real one and PKK and YPG is

165
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,599
the same organization even Americans

166
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,390
that miss this Americans believe that

167
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,120
YPG is a terrorist organization and they

168
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,310
are trying to convince us that it is

169
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,250
another strategic choice but they had to

170
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,890
choose but working with another

171
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,750
terrorist organization to defeat - isn't

172
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:05,550
it is not the right right so what are

173
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:09,040
you going to do and typical question why

174
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:12,310
YPG is fighting - because they hate the

175
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,770
ideology or because they hate - no they

176
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:18,270
just want to gain more territory and at

177
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:21,849
the end they want to divide Syria and

178
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:25,030
they have been forcing the others even

179
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:27,730
the other Kurds to leave all the cities

180
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,619
that they have been forcing it is a kind

181
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,210
of ethnic cleansing and this is very

182
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,960
dangerous for the future of the country

183
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:38,260
and we are hosting 300,000 Kurds from

184
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,780
Syria and most of them were forced by

185
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,059
YPG to live because they don't share the

186
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,339
ideology of YPG they don't share the

187
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,510
Marxist communist ideology of YPG okay

188
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,940
we're going to return to this but I

189
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,340
won't put something else in the pot in

190
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:54,850
southern southern Syria along the Jordan

191
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,070
border Jordan has its concerns as well

192
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,350
as we know some of the Islamic state

193
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,840
fighters are heading towards your border

194
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,000
they're not very far away and there's a

195
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,920
concern that once mosul and raqqa fall

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,960
there'll be even more we've heard from

197
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,439
Turkey about its concerns what about

198
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,090
Jordan well thank you very much let me

199
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,620
reiterate what my brother foreign

200
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,970
minister Javad shoulder said and

201
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,160
expressing

202
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,830
extreme happiness to be here with my

203
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,699
colleagues and to be at the Bratislava

204
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,500
forum again now I don't think you can

205
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,790
look at things with with such a

206
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,520
fine-tooth comb I mean I think you have

207
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,290
to really look at the larger picture as

208
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,020
far as I'm concerned and being liberated

209
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,689
from public office I can express my

210
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,520
opinions more freely perhaps we've

211
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,950
always wanted - to come closer to our

212
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,750
border so we can strike them harder and

213
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:49,190
so you know the this notion of -

214
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,750
fighters coming close to our borders yes

215
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,510
of course we have to be vigilant we have

216
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:58,310
to of course take every precaution and

217
00:09:53,510 --> 00:10:00,380
every measure but the the closer they

218
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,290
are to our border the easier it is for

219
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:07,100
us to hit them and you know that Jordan

220
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:09,560
has been in the in the forefront of this

221
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,990
fight against terrorism

222
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,040
I just want to perhaps if you'll allow

223
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:19,220
me to talk about you are very very

224
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,050
focused when you said we're very very

225
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,040
close or are we very very close to

226
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,959
territorially defeat - and my brother my

227
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,469
blood said something that's extremely

228
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,300
pertinent also which is that yes there

229
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,040
are some homegrown solutions but some of

230
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,589
these challenges and problems that we

231
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,329
face have become global migration

232
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,310
terrorism Syria Iraq I mean only talking

233
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,260
about these these issues they are they

234
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,430
are global and in some countries in the

235
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,270
Middle East you'll find that there's a

236
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:50,120
mixture of national causes for

237
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,670
radicalization and extremism and trans

238
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,740
national or international causes I mean

239
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,819
any look at any country in the Middle

240
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,270
East and you'll find that it's either

241
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:03,339
this or that or a mixture of of both the

242
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:06,350
fight against - may well militarily be

243
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,210
decided in the next few weeks and that

244
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,670
in the sense that some of the territory

245
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,430
that they had occupied will be liberated

246
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,979
will regain that's extremely important

247
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:19,790
extremely important as a milestone but

248
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,950
does not mean that - is over that I

249
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,230
should become less visible but probably

250
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,030
just as notorious as we have seen

251
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,110
recently so we have to be very very

252
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,420
careful we have to continue our

253
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,529
cooperation but the the actual battled

254
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,699
to defeat -

255
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,680
let's look at a territorial for the

256
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:36,680
moment that's the immediate focus we

257
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,120
know the ideology is also a concern we

258
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,709
heard of some of the concerns about this

259
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,790
battle to take it that may determine

260
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,589
what happens afterwards

261
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,899
do you have particularly particular

262
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,670
concerns about the kind of forces which

263
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,089
are gathered together to try to defeat

264
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,069
them

265
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:51,019
no no concerns whatsoever on the country

266
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:53,628
I think the international collaboration

267
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:55,579
and the more countries that are joining

268
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,579
right now and we saw the recent

269
00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:01,849
commitment made by NATO and and others

270
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:04,309
is very very important to have more

271
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,749
countries more organizations joining

272
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:07,459
this this fight

273
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:09,379
you've got Syrian Kurdish forces I know

274
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:10,819
well I mean with your brother but yeah

275
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,110
he's my brother

276
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:14,029
we don't necessarily have to do

277
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,749
everything but this is I mean he

278
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:18,860
answered it from a texture perspective

279
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:20,120
and of course one has to respect that

280
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,589
but you know this is not what we're

281
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,319
talking about we're not we're talking

282
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:29,029
about the ultimate goal of defeating of

283
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:30,469
defeating a dive but also if I may you

284
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,569
also mentioned something very important

285
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,819
in your introduction saying we don't the

286
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:36,139
son of - or the daughter of that I I

287
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:38,540
don't care if it's a son or daughter I

288
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:40,970
don't want a successor to die we saw

289
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,430
what fueled the creation and the

290
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,110
existence and that's gaining strength of

291
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,059
of that which is political

292
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,129
marginalization in certain in certain

293
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:52,250
country now we don't want we have to

294
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:55,819
find this careful balance where the

295
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:58,250
military defeat the territorial defeat

296
00:12:55,819 --> 00:13:00,889
of - in Iraq and Syria will somehow

297
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,019
morph itself into a political process

298
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:04,069
that will ensure a better future that

299
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:06,410
will ensure that we don't have

300
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:08,628
marginalization again that will create a

301
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:12,100
successor to - and I have more to say

302
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:14,569
about the sender's voice okay so John

303
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,040
there's two battlefields Syria and Iraq

304
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:17,899
they've got a different coalition of

305
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,219
forces let's just look at the Syrian

306
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:20,899
we've heard some concerns about the

307
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,269
Alliance was at least three different

308
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:27,949
fronts moving toward Raqqa the Syrian

309
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:29,509
democratic forces were it isn't is one

310
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:31,040
of them the Syrian army is another

311
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,679
working with Russia and Iran the

312
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,509
Americans are in the mix what are your

313
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:40,730
particular concerns it's it's very messy

314
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:42,610
it's not just miss you know in Syria

315
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,490
it's messy in

316
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,720
in a rock master was talking about it

317
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,620
I'm not this up if you like man if you

318
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:54,399
talk about how you stop - recurring or

319
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,350
rebooting you need to address the wider

320
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,810
more fundamental structural discontents

321
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,470
in the region if you look at what's

322
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,149
happening in in Syria and Iraq and what

323
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:08,110
in particular actually there is a very

324
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:11,649
good I think military strategy to defeat

325
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,570
- in Mosul and dice will be eventually

326
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:15,880
pushed out of most and defeated it'll

327
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,589
come at a considerable cost particularly

328
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,300
working security forces and others but

329
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,310
they will be pushed out but every time

330
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,290
they are pushed out of an area as we've

331
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,670
seen with other similar organizations in

332
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,630
the past when you smash them they

333
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:31,800
fragment and go elsewhere you need a

334
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:35,649
political a political and economic

335
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,120
strategy on top of this but not to stop

336
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:40,980
them recurring because I don't think you

337
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,360
can stop the ideology rebooting and

338
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,670
seeding receding elsewhere we've seen

339
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,019
this we've seen this over the last 40

340
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,939
years with a succession of different

341
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,860
different organizations and if -

342
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,130
themselves disappeared will bid it be

343
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,500
some other organization all you can do

344
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,300
is build resilience in the states of the

345
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,570
region and this has to be a state-based

346
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,819
solution I mean when when the minister

347
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,199
was talking as quite correctly the

348
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,500
beginning about this being a regional

349
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,839
regional solutions - to these to these

350
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,339
challenges that's true but you can't

351
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,720
have regional solutions I don't think

352
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:15,250
without a significant significant

353
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,420
international support and this is where

354
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,130
of course United States come in

355
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,810
historically now I think one of the

356
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,180
problems we've seen Siriano world and

357
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,800
world we've got so messy was because

358
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,569
actually in many ways the Americans with

359
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,479
growth in these two arenas and I think

360
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,860
this is unless you have that that the

361
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,399
hyper power the single hyper power

362
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,500
convening not just States in the region

363
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,209
but outside in terms of the military

364
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,040
effort but also the political effort and

365
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,839
more fundamentally the economic

366
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
reconstruction of let's let's look at

367
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:45,730
today the proverbial day after there

368
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,610
isn't there is a the military strategy

369
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,699
seems to be working so far in Mosul it's

370
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,050
messy when it comes to Raqqa but what

371
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,069
about the day after people even though

372
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,819
people have talked about the day after

373
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:58,430
in Mosul for years

374
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,410
when you read the reports now people are

375
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,599
worried they don't really know what it's

376
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,550
going to look like the political the the

377
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,320
new political structures and they don't

378
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,089
know they know there's not enough money

379
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,040
and the Americans have made it clear

380
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,630
they are not there to be part of nation

381
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,640
building stabilization yet but our

382
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,670
nation-building briefly from you do you

383
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,110
have concerns as we speak that the day

384
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,819
after in both mosul and raqqa

385
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,830
they're not ready for it in terms of the

386
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,570
thinking yeah and the money I do I've

387
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,700
used concerns about it and I think it's

388
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,800
not the day after the counts it's the 25

389
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,930
years after they're the most important

390
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,900
thing and this is we're talking I mean

391
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,620
we work together and we are last last

392
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,530
weekend

393
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,960
yes it was we were there for launch the

394
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,120
relaunch of the the Islamic Alliance

395
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,730
coalition against against against

396
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,270
terrorism which is which is which is

397
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:51,020
good and people yes um but but I still

398
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:53,300
don't see a political plan I actually

399
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,890
think if you the political plan needs to

400
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,030
focus on the rock quite honestly because

401
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,310
I think Syria is a much more difficult

402
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:02,660
difficult case I think Iraq is amazing

403
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:04,310
but equally but I just think I was

404
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,190
looking this morning who said some

405
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,540
photographs of the parts of a leper and

406
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,580
of course not all Aleppo is destroyed

407
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,720
but significant parts of Aleppo have

408
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,909
been destroyed and if you look at what

409
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,579
if you look at Aleppo now or jarabulus

410
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:19,250
or manage or decreed or Ahmadi or

411
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:21,889
Fallujah they look they look like

412
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,380
Mogadishu that's right and and this does

413
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,690
the physical reconstruction is going to

414
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,060
be a massive challenge let alone the

415
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,180
moral political and border structure not

416
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:34,399
I agree I mean that the risk of taking

417
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,230
pre-empting my good friend Pollock for

418
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,150
before he speaks I just want to say

419
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,400
quickly it's I mean fighting back

420
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,940
fighting Isis fighting you know the

421
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,590
whole the whole package the military the

422
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,270
security and the ideological and we

423
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,439
evolved all of us agree that the

424
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,660
ideological is going to be the longest

425
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,370
the longest battle now but in order to

426
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,100
do that I'm you've got the military

427
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,510
which I said is an extremely important

428
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,860
factor but in order to do that

429
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,120
effectively you've got to address

430
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,310
political social and economic

431
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,919
deprivation not just in up up well but

432
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,540
even beyond deprivation leads to

433
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,550
desperation desperation always leads to

434
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,290
extremism we know that all too

435
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,480
- well so being politically deprived or

436
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,149
margin like will result in more

437
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,950
extremism being born and and raised

438
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,050
somewhere else so we just have to look

439
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,490
at the whole the whole package economic

440
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,260
and social social and economic

441
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,760
deprivation is equally important to look

442
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,930
at and I think when you talk about a

443
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,490
Marshall Plan and you met somebody

444
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,540
mentioned the Marshall Plan you've got

445
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,040
to sort out the politics and the

446
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,450
security and the military and then go

447
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,159
into this you know this phase of the

448
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,540
Marshall the Marshall Plan you can't do

449
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,350
it you work business you know the the

450
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:39,780
the alienation and the statements of a

451
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,879
whole generation we'll take take a long

452
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,470
time 25 years the first place you have

453
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,940
to get the water running you have to get

454
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,380
the electricity started you have to

455
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,940
repair people's homes there's an

456
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,190
estimate an estimate that's gonna cost

457
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,810
of their minds on Hoff's yeah 100

458
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,850
billion dollars okay let's let's just

459
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,710
for a moment remind ourselves of what it

460
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,939
looks like on the ground we have a

461
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,850
little film we're going to show you just

462
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:03,890
to show just in visual imagery about

463
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,889
what it looks like in this battle

464
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:11,260
[Music]

465
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:27,419
[Music]

466
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:59,040
[Music]

467
00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:03,590
I love this it's like coming to cinemas

468
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:06,510
near you you know Hollywood stars so

469
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:10,110
huge you see the huge destruction

470
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:12,780
so it's ball it is more than likely that

471
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,159
physical Caliphate will be destroyed but

472
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,649
our goose pond you've written about this

473
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,299
the virtual caliphate will still be

474
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:22,950
there people have touched on it already

475
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:25,320
but - in some form will continue to live

476
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,600
and could actually set its sights for

477
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,418
further from the region in Europe how do

478
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:35,428
you see the future after the military

479
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:37,020
battles - or ice itself to be honest for

480
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:40,559
me is not particularly that interesting

481
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:44,879
I think it will be defeated and crushed

482
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,799
as we have seen Islamic Jihad before as

483
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,470
we have seen the most elements of

484
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,929
al-qaeda in certain parts as we have

485
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,960
seen a tech hero and his rather so many

486
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:56,340
groups that appeared in that part of the

487
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,350
world I mean the eastern Mediterranean

488
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,540
Levant and North Africa in the past 30

489
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,490
40 years and it has been mentioned

490
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,909
already three times that the ideology

491
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:08,040
has found a way to to remain I

492
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,290
personally believe that the threat that

493
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,760
the ideology will face quite soon will

494
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,040
not come from the state will come from

495
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,750
theological innovation already happening

496
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,309
in in this time well but that's

497
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,110
different stories but I think the

498
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:22,889
interesting part for me at least right

499
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,750
now is that when Isis - is destroyed

500
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,790
certainly we will see new groups

501
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,830
appearing I actually think they were

502
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:32,820
certainly certainly in my mind and I

503
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:35,879
think worse the forum itself again we

504
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,700
can we can debate how different Isis was

505
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,250
from remember Al Qaeda in bled the

506
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,929
ravine in Iraq before or from al Qaeda

507
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,919
from al Qaeda Turkish Foreign Minister

508
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:46,290
is getting really worried is not going

509
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,900
to sleep tonight after his look I think

510
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,600
for me the point that I would qualify in

511
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,940
what you said this is I Europe is a

512
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,520
different issue but I think

513
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,650
militant Islamist groups will remain in

514
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,780
the estimated trainings of Isis will be

515
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,450
defeated somebody mentioned scattered

516
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,750
yes I think other groups with other

517
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,669
names will emerge in the same land in my

518
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,679
and to my mind you have to keep in mind

519
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:13,799
a number of things that I'm not saying

520
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:17,100
that they doom the region but to a large

521
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,970
extent are serious threats to my mind at

522
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,969
least and I hope I'm wrong

523
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,970
one is that sorry you are going to save

524
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,440
you then if you had here you have a

525
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,360
current foreign minister and a former

526
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,919
foreign minister if if they had called

527
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,780
you in for some advice about how to deal

528
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,570
with these certain threats what kind of

529
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,178
leadership can be shown to contain if

530
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,110
not to avoid what's next what's to come

531
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,510
well I'll tell you what tell you what

532
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,309
makes me a bit concerned and whether the

533
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,840
nation states the big powerful nation

534
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:44,610
states of the region can do something

535
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,699
about in this different issue but one is

536
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,379
that we have had two pillars of nation

537
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,630
state in the eastern Mediterranean in

538
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,610
the last hundred years and these since

539
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,760
the end of the Ottoman Empire and these

540
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,049
two pillars are called Syria and Iraq by

541
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,770
demography at least I'm searching by

542
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:01,980
geography

543
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:05,250
now these central state in both of them

544
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,950
is gone and sadly I think my mind is

545
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:12,539
gone for some time number two I think

546
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:14,400
the nation in Iraq as well effectively I

547
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:16,440
mean I would put lots of question marks

548
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,419
on effective central state in Iraq I

549
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,070
hope I'm wrong they trying to stay

550
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,320
together in Syria but the second point

551
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,030
is remember and people in the room

552
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,428
notice even better than I do that the

553
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,260
nation-state that appeared in the last

554
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:31,169
hundred years was to a large extent

555
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,450
based on the idea of Arab nests in

556
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:37,470
different forms in Syria in Iraq you

557
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:39,030
that idea is in theory at least the

558
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,309
exact opposite of the idea of

559
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,260
sectarianism of sectarian identity and

560
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:45,330
whether we like it or not I do not like

561
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,460
it but whether we like it or not the

562
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,110
notion of sectarianism in the eastern

563
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,510
Mediterranean has been gaining immense

564
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,330
ground over there I'll do even more

565
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:56,100
where after this Riyadh summit where it

566
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,500
is being cast will do even more

567
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,260
sectarian terms not explicitly stated

568
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,679
but and one final point to also to keep

569
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:07,289
in mind is that I think it's politically

570
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,780
correct to say that nation-states across

571
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:11,190
the region are opposed all of them in

572
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,770
one way or another to militant groups

573
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:17,850
but let's be also frank in the sense of

574
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:19,470
you have major geopolitical struggle in

575
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,908
the wider Middle East

576
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,370
that has been raging for a number of

577
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,990
time now you do have a vacuum created by

578
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,668
simply by the collapse of some states

579
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,830
and of course if you have militant

580
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:30,990
groups that are on the ground they are

581
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,629
tools to be used by some countries and

582
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,370
many of them are more than happy to be

583
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,770
used because most of them are not

584
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,870
necessarily there because they are

585
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:43,970
ideologically inspired but also many of

586
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,969
them are there because they are

587
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,850
mercenaries if anyone in this room is

588
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,070
expecting a call from President Trump

589
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,510
please

590
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,340
hahahaha please please keep your

591
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,559
telephone on please keep it on because

592
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,629
we would like to hear what is Middle

593
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,340
East policy is if however you are not

594
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:06,000
expecting a call from President Trump

595
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,530
please turn your telephone or off there

596
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,500
is no better place to be than here with

597
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:12,210
our distinguished guests your excellency

598
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,090
we've just heard from our philosopher

599
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,470
that the two pillars serene e-rock are

600
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:19,678
falling apart say I never called myself

601
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,720
philosopher thank you for business I'm a

602
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,440
journalist I'll give you a title um

603
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,780
a respected uh respected analyst of its

604
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,669
new trend I love it I love it

605
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:32,220
I took the King on I took the King off

606
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:35,159
but um with but states which are not

607
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,650
holding together this is not luxury for

608
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,049
you it's right on your border what would

609
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,610
what would be your homegrown solution

610
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:43,710
let's take Syria which is I think of

611
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,629
great concern to you right now people

612
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,120
talk about that it will be some kind of

613
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:50,700
loose partition you know the new idea of

614
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,500
safe zones or de-escalation zones seem

615
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,450
to be heading in that direction give us

616
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,309
a little sense of what your homegrown

617
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,380
solution would be although and we know

618
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:59,850
there'll be some elements that you won't

619
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,320
agree with with the Americans and others

620
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:06,809
involved in this some well first of all

621
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,178
let me start from here you can defeat

622
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:11,580
the terrorist organization in this city

623
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:15,510
on in that city or in this country that

624
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:18,090
country militarily but unless we have a

625
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:20,490
genuine political solution we can we

626
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,158
cannot defeat neither the terrorist

627
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,520
organizations or terrorists or nor the

628
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,590
ideology of the terrorists and therefore

629
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,549
we have to focus the political solution

630
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,500
in Syria and also in Iraq in Iraq the

631
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,310
problem is

632
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:40,220
discrimination ethnic and sectarian

633
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:44,940
discrimination of the administration and

634
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:48,240
in Syria it is something else it's a

635
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,730
civil war in Syria so we have to find a

636
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,960
political solution yeah we made a lot of

637
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:57,180
achievements against - to defeat - and

638
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,830
militarily on the ground yeah we have we

639
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,930
been we made also a lot of achievements

640
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,389
or we have been successful to stop the

641
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,550
foreign terrorist fighters for we have

642
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,320
better cooperation with the sources at

643
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:11,520
the Ransom country better information

644
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:15,840
and intelligence sharing but at the end

645
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,150
if the fertile ground is done as long as

646
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,149
the fertile ground is there which is the

647
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,190
situation in Syria in Iraq we cannot

648
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:26,160
defeat the terrorist organization fully

649
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,050
therefore we have to pay attention to

650
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,650
the political solution that is what we

651
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:33,419
have been doing with Russia we also in

652
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:35,340
Damascus in terms of a political wider

653
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,020
political transition which trends

654
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,270
transition well the parameters of the

655
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:42,030
parameters of the political solution is

656
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,470
very clear it is in the UN Security

657
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,600
Council 2 to 5 phone

658
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:48,480
my brother Nasir also contributed a lot

659
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:53,580
to this and therefore the parameters

660
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:58,470
over there transition and also a new

661
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,699
constitution and election and you think

662
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,660
country do you think that's gonna happen

663
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,790
anytime soon

664
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,980
no it can happen it can happen it can

665
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,409
happen but with the right strategies

666
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,960
that why I have been emphasizing the

667
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:12,990
right strategy predetermined result

668
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:17,070
oriented strategy we have to have a long

669
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:19,650
term vision for Syria not short-sighted

670
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,870
plans turkey in fact is working with

671
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,180
Russia that's why that's why ensuring

672
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,850
this ceasefire or cessation of the

673
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:29,460
hostilities is important and at the last

674
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:32,909
Astana meeting Jordan is also observed

675
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:36,780
there why did we have to sign an

676
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:39,810
agreement for de-escalation zones since

677
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,370
the agreements or the understanding that

678
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:44,740
the regime and the

679
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:47,799
opposition sign there have been serious

680
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,500
violations and when there is a serious

681
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:53,980
violations it is not easy to actually

682
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:58,240
maintain the neither astana process no

683
00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:01,509
Geneva person that's why we we have to

684
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,360
make sure that there is no violation and

685
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:07,769
now we are working how to implement this

686
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:10,658
agreement on the escalation zones and

687
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:13,299
how can be mobilized observers over

688
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:17,610
there and we are working with all these

689
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:22,870
guarantor countries and but just

690
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:25,750
ensuring the ceasefire is not enough

691
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,340
alone we need to convince both sides to

692
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,129
start the meaningful genuine

693
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,870
negotiations in Geneva and Geneva is the

694
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:34,439
main platform for the political

695
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:37,779
solutions John Jenkins you agree that

696
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,090
there's a road to transition which will

697
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:43,480
gather base or are we going to be with a

698
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:45,220
messy kind of I don't know use partition

699
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,210
but in similar time people controlling

700
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,830
different groups controlling different

701
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,059
areas of Syria for some time to come I

702
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,408
think I think that is what's going to

703
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:51,668
happen and I think that's fundamentally

704
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:53,470
unstable but I think it's going to be

705
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:54,669
unstable for very long time I think all

706
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,320
you can try and do in Syria quite

707
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,940
frankly is to dial down the violence you

708
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,379
need to have some sort of process some

709
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,549
sort of way of reducing the level of

710
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:03,490
conflict because the level of conflict

711
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,779
is massively costly in human be

712
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,580
humanity's in terms human to them in

713
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:09,070
financial terms people I still think

714
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,570
that Iraq is I mean I think there is a

715
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,250
central state in the world simply

716
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,200
because I work as oil and I think that

717
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,779
which is big a big distinction with with

718
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,549
with with Syria and at the heart of most

719
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:20,529
central states in the Middle East is

720
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:22,480
money is a budgetary process or fiscal

721
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:24,639
process don't forget there's a bookert

722
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,740
referendum this is this year isn't a no

723
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:28,178
but I think smiley faces but I think I

724
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,799
think even if you have I mean you know

725
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:31,779
it people talk about federal a federal

726
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,429
solution for Syria I mean my problem

727
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:34,419
with a federal solution is is that

728
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:35,889
you're going to get a bunch of

729
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:37,120
statements all of which will fight each

730
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:38,590
other because there'll be there'll be

731
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,768
irredeemably irredentist

732
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,870
in Iraq even if you even if a rock is

733
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:46,000
has some sort of federal solution

734
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:48,309
federal law federal outcome or whatever

735
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,240
it is in with the kurds in the north

736
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:51,250
wing of the KRG

737
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,650
you still need a central state to

738
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,050
distribute

739
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:57,840
to act as the as the arbiter of the

740
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:00,210
distribution of the spoils of the of the

741
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,740
of the of the divided state this is my

742
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,230
issue with with the wither wither work I

743
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,980
remember when I was ambassador who are

744
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:09,180
talking to my friend saamne Jaffe about

745
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,000
this and he would say well we need a

746
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,500
Sunni region just like the the Kurds

747
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
have a region and they and they are

748
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,290
talking about now I took it earlier

749
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,270
they've never stopped talking about it

750
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,530
actually but I said to him or what

751
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:21,330
exactly you gonna live on I mean the

752
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,639
Kurds have oil and gas the south are oil

753
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,080
and gas you have sand you may have oil

754
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,090
and gas under that sand but nobody's

755
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,590
explored for it so what exactly is the

756
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,439
process by which you sustain yourself

757
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,610
what a place to call home at least but

758
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,870
this is also the issue of course in

759
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,090
Libya because people talk about Libya

760
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,820
well I can understand you know if you

761
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:40,830
have Tripoli and Al Barca a Simon acre

762
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,590
what happens to fazham in the middle and

763
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,750
there is nothing there so it's simply

764
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:49,050
splitting a state it simply is a recipe

765
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,100
for disaster if you ask me we are we've

766
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,230
gone all this way actually I should say

767
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,669
without mentioning Iran as well and I

768
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,290
know we talked about the PKK if you look

769
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:57,000
at the PKK I mean I bunt by agree I

770
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,220
think the PKK and YPG essentially the

771
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,080
same thing but but they are also

772
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,540
supported by Iran so when we think about

773
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,980
the messiness of this if you look at

774
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,440
what the PKK are doing and get cooked

775
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,700
for example opens in jar the Iranian

776
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,730
zone active in this as well which makes

777
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,860
it even more volatile okay let's I just

778
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,480
wonder we've heard some of you or point

779
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,740
some of your concerns I would just want

780
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,240
to get a sense of what everyone in the

781
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,920
audience is thinking about while they

782
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,540
listen to this all of you have come to

783
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,160
this session with your own particular

784
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:27,450
interesting concerns just by a show of

785
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:29,040
hands most of most of will fall - will

786
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,530
be defeated militarily and also how many

787
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,210
of you think the day after in Mosul the

788
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:36,180
international community will manage to

789
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:38,580
work with the Iraqis to have a stable

790
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,650
political solution for that region and

791
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,780
also the money to rebuild how many of

792
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,780
you are pretty optimistic about it I

793
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,430
mean okay how many you are do as we

794
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:53,480
speak deeply deeply concerned about the

795
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,480
day after in Mosul

796
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,539
okay what about Syria we would all we

797
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,280
all want to believe you your excellency

798
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:04,669
we all want to believe there can be a

799
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,950
smooth peaceful transition in Syria for

800
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:10,190
a kind of leadership that the majority

801
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:12,650
of Syrians want it's their decision how

802
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:17,570
many of you remain still deeply worried

803
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:18,770
about the months to come in Syria and

804
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:24,590
how many of you believe the worst is not

805
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:26,120
over boom for a bayonet may I that is

806
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,289
the point okay that's what you day why

807
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,570
don't you Jordan

808
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:32,360
right you're yours Jordan has played a

809
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,620
role behind the scenes in front of the

810
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,600
scenes you're right on the border you're

811
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:38,330
bordering state a lot at stake for you

812
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,980
what would you say to this this kind of

813
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,439
mood in the audience about the future of

814
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,299
Syria and Iraq yeah well what can be

815
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,179
done what is the homegrown solution yeah

816
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:49,340
Turkey and Jordan have a common

817
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:51,380
denominator and and the fact that you

818
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,500
know we border both Syria and dila yeah

819
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,880
I just want to I just want to go back to

820
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,049
the Syrian I think the foreign minister

821
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,659
was absolutely correcting that we have

822
00:33:57,049 --> 00:34:01,700
to look at the long-term solution for

823
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:04,309
Syria the larger picture but with

824
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,740
immediate short-term steps that one has

825
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:08,509
to take for the longest time we argued

826
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,619
and my brother would remember in the

827
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:14,240
different meetings that we had before

828
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:16,639
the ISSG we argued over you know asset

829
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,168
for example is it is it a prerequisite

830
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,659
that that he leaves or is it the

831
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:22,279
inevitable outcome of a process we

832
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,679
argued about the involvement of Russia

833
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,909
and we I was one of representing my

834
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:30,440
country and was saying that Russia has

835
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:34,639
to be invoked because Russia holds a

836
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,260
major key and now I think what in in

837
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,899
hindsight and hindsight is a luxury

838
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,859
always you think about some of the

839
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:41,179
things that we should have done instead

840
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:42,710
of thinking about the personalities and

841
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,000
the leadership as you said we should

842
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,918
have been thinking about the process

843
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,899
that would produce the leadership not

844
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,980
not not the personalities but the

845
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:51,409
process that could create the

846
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,270
personality and I think as the foreign

847
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:54,290
minister of Turkey said that if you have

848
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,440
you know that the dilections the

849
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:58,670
constitutional reforms and the the

850
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,339
different steps that are required to

851
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,410
complete the democratic process plus the

852
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:07,070
fight against terrorism which again is

853
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,879
in the same context because if the fight

854
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,319
again if

855
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,170
Isis is defeated out of the Iraq

856
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:14,299
completely and pushed out of Syria

857
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,789
completely and you don't have a Syrian

858
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:19,309
national context and you usually do you

859
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:21,019
think completely as possible completely

860
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:22,309
I'm talking about territory you're not

861
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:24,078
you no no no I go back to what I said

862
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:26,900
earlier you may get them out

863
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,940
territorially but I is as an ideology or

864
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,670
the successor to Isis will be that so

865
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,529
long as we don't put together a

866
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,119
collective effort to address again

867
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:37,490
political economic and social that the

868
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,559
Prairie so having said that if you if

869
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,359
you defeat Isis territory whether in

870
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:43,460
Iraq or and saying mainly in Syria so

871
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,920
this is the topic in question now and

872
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,690
you don't have a Syrian national context

873
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,390
to support that meaning a political

874
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:53,089
process that will ensure that everything

875
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,578
is done to avoid marginalization or

876
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:57,230
deprivation or desperation or economic

877
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:59,329
woes or whatever it is that will create

878
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,279
the right conditions for another dive

879
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:03,019
then you have a problem this is a huge

880
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:05,690
challenge I want to pick up a fantastic

881
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:08,629
let me give you two examples or share

882
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:11,690
two experiences from Iraq about the

883
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:14,630
long-term and short-term plans when

884
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:18,380
America was living they wanted to hand

885
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:21,200
over Iraq to the ends of Maliki we

886
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,789
advised them not to do that because we

887
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,200
know how much Maliki is sectarian and

888
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:30,019
against the other groups including the

889
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,000
Kurds and treatment Sunni Arabs American

890
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:35,089
says that for the transition they could

891
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,849
stay and they and he is not harmful now

892
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:41,000
here where we are just because of Maliki

893
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:43,759
and now why muscle operation is

894
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,809
successful because that is an agreement

895
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:51,230
that neither Peshmerga no hashed ashabi

896
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:53,390
is in the city so this is actually long

897
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,369
term perspective nowadays hostage hobby

898
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,170
is violating the agreement this is

899
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:59,900
another story the meaning should tell a

900
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:03,230
dangerous but this is the extremely long

901
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:05,930
term perspective it is which is good so

902
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:08,269
short term plans will not work and the

903
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:11,509
mistakes in of those short term plans

904
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:12,589
will have long term consequences but

905
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:14,329
you're absolutely right I think we do

906
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:16,819
need glimmers of Hope erupted learned

907
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:18,829
some lessons that it with each big

908
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,560
battle Ramadi Fallujah

909
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:22,060
now Mosul they have learned

910
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,970
some lessons and they have been thinking

911
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:27,610
about the this or the coalition of

912
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:29,230
forces I want to bring you in Turku some

913
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:31,690
because you mentioned Iran let us bring

914
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:35,320
it back to this current week after the

915
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:37,990
Riyadh summit President Trump King

916
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,690
Salman of Saudi Arabia the members 55

917
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:43,390
members of the Arab Islamic Coalition

918
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:46,210
they have painted the region as Sunni

919
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:49,990
Arabs largely against the main threat

920
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:52,960
which they see as Iran but Iran is a key

921
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,220
if not the key actor in Iraq and a key

922
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,130
actor in Syria

923
00:37:54,220 --> 00:38:00,279
can you Terrace maan resolve the

924
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,560
problems in Iraq and Syria unless the

925
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,790
homegrown solution is everyone who's in

926
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,700
the house everyone who's at home

927
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:08,770
including Iran can I go to Iran through

928
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,779
a response to the majority that raised

929
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,910
their hands about the very bleak future

930
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,920
of Syria I share your view but for very

931
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:17,080
simple point irrespective of the

932
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,150
political situation or solution that you

933
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,620
will find for Syria two things has

934
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,740
already happened in Syria and they are

935
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,330
almost irrevocable one people keep

936
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,100
talking about the I don't know two

937
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:29,470
million dead or something but what

938
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,870
people forget is that over 12 million

939
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:34,600
Syrians after I've left Syria right now

940
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:38,109
the vast vast majority of them are Sunni

941
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,400
Muslims and most of them are in

942
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,230
countries that will not host them

943
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,760
forever and Europe doesn't want them so

944
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:46,390
at one point in time they would need to

945
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,860
come back coming back meaning that the

946
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,920
political transition that you would

947
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,450
agree today will be on a demography that

948
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,800
is vastly different from the demography

949
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,899
that you'd expect to have 10 years from

950
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,790
today that's a disaster but point number

951
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,380
two which is very important I think and

952
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:01,390
I've come to around to that identity

953
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,850
politics in the Arab world and in the

954
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:07,750
Middle East is crucial Syria is a

955
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:09,880
relatively modern state but it's a very

956
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,430
old entity and without get into too much

957
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:16,750
history Syria the historical city has

958
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:19,480
always been the heartland of Sunni Arab

959
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,430
ISM in the East a military that has

960
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,380
always been the case for at least a

961
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:26,169
thousand years at least a thousand years

962
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,350
the current political structure today

963
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:31,390
and the demography in Syria today has

964
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,730
diluted a lot of that sense

965
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:38,170
that means that you are creating an

966
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:41,140
ocean an entity that is at heart opposed

967
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:43,000
to the history the tradition - the -

968
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,828
even the feelings of that has always

969
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,170
dominated that part of the land and

970
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:49,029
that's irrational it's it's completely a

971
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,069
historical if you'd like and a history

972
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:52,450
does not survive history if its periods

973
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:54,940
want to believe there's still a serious

974
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:57,430
about Syria yeah well but fair enough

975
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,859
absolutely but that Syria was created as

976
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:02,230
we all know here in the early twenties

977
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:04,690
as effectively a land that was more or

978
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:07,510
less put as a majority of Sunni Muslims

979
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,069
in response to certain minorities for

980
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,690
them a certain country was created

981
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:13,900
called modern Lebanon anyway to come a

982
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:15,730
century go don't respect us Sir John

983
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,799
it was drawn up on the map now it's

984
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,930
being redrawn in certain ways can it be

985
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:22,509
put back together again bring us back to

986
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:25,390
2017 I would love to be put back again

987
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:27,579
but demography is crucial human beings

988
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,500
are the heart of any of any state so you

989
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:31,210
can impose whatever political solution

990
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,039
you want from the top if it does not

991
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:35,380
resonate with the identity of the

992
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,690
majority in the now you have a problem

993
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,549
because it would not last and that takes

994
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,710
us to Iran I'll say one point or the lot

995
00:40:39,549 --> 00:40:45,400
asleep forever I think to a very large

996
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:47,319
extent there is Iranian expansionism

997
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,789
obviously that has been there in the

998
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,529
region for a number of number of times

999
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:54,880
for number of years right now but I

1000
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:58,269
think the problem that many people need

1001
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,759
to appreciate is that Iran comes with

1002
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:03,038
two dimensions that antagonize a lot of

1003
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:05,859
people one is a sectarian dimension and

1004
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:10,269
another is a national dimension and both

1005
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:12,788
of them I put a blank rub the wrong way

1006
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:14,769
if you'd like many people in the eastern

1007
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:16,809
Mediterranean and that's why you have to

1008
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:18,519
talk to Iran from keeping in mind that

1009
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:21,369
it is it is if you take it as an

1010
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:23,769
opponent you are raising more fires in

1011
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:26,289
the region it has to be brought from

1012
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:28,839
from that identity matching to the

1013
00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:30,609
region and we can't emit as much as

1014
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:34,480
people want to criticize what the way

1015
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:36,490
Iran be axed its use of militias in Iraq

1016
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,349
and Syria the fact of the matter is the

1017
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,819
Syrian government wants it there and the

1018
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:41,950
Iraqi government wants it there it's not

1019
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:44,540
as if it just landed without being asked

1020
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,890
what we're being encouraged to

1021
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:49,490
very important point but just very

1022
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:53,060
quickly on this idea of demography and

1023
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:54,609
you mentioned back to 2017 well 2016 we

1024
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:59,450
marked a hundred years of sykes-picot

1025
00:41:54,610 --> 00:42:04,220
and many and many people would would

1026
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:06,890
argue that sykes-picot in 1916 was about

1027
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:09,259
geography and geopolitics without taking

1028
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:13,430
demography into into consideration and

1029
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:16,070
that's why in 2016 2015 2014 you're

1030
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,660
seeing demography biting back and taking

1031
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,880
revenge and I think this is very very

1032
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,170
important to to to just absolutely

1033
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,910
you're absolutely right the demography

1034
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,610
and the demography the way it's been

1035
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:27,500
disrupted the movement of millions of

1036
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,910
people make turkey is worried about the

1037
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,530
demography you were right Lee you're

1038
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,600
right to point out the shifting

1039
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,940
demography of Syria what impact was

1040
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,250
demography has now been weaponized in a

1041
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,080
way in in Syria and Iraq and it's very

1042
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,520
very dangerous and sectarianism has been

1043
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,920
weaponized yes exactly

1044
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,100
one only one sentence I think it is in

1045
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:49,550
in the long term benefit of Iran itself

1046
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,290
to keep in mind that it it has always

1047
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,520
had a wonderful positioning in

1048
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,220
especially in the eastern Mediterranean

1049
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,110
not only in Iraq because of its cultural

1050
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,620
cooperation the richness of its culture

1051
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:03,140
the more the positioning of Iran is seen

1052
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,120
as sectarian and nationalist as opposed

1053
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,430
to the Sunnis in if you'd like and Arab

1054
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:12,350
use the more it is not in the long term

1055
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:15,319
benefit of Iran well we shouldn't forget

1056
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:19,069
that Iran is an important actor exactly

1057
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:21,020
area and but Iran is not playing a

1058
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:24,050
positive role or constructive role

1059
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,000
rather very negative and Iran's

1060
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:30,790
ambitious should be counterbalance on

1061
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,250
the other hand isolating or ignoring

1062
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:37,330
Iran totally is not realistic and not

1063
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:39,770
helpful and we should also give Iran

1064
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:42,860
responsibilities to enhance the

1065
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:45,370
political solution and to overcome the

1066
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:48,080
situation as well that's why we gave

1067
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:50,960
responsibility to Iran in Astana Iran

1068
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,750
became official guarantor when we met in

1069
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,480
Moscow a lot together with Lavrov and

1070
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,339
javad zarif I put very simple question

1071
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,519
to Java

1072
00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:02,140
if to include among us I'm into the

1073
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,399
system

1074
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,410
what do you guarantee you have to

1075
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,589
guarantee something otherwise you cannot

1076
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,719
be here that's right and he told he told

1077
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:16,099
us that is the guarantee of the

1078
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:19,309
ceasefire so far not but fully isolating

1079
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:21,289
and ignoring Iran is not realistic so I

1080
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:23,539
know the problem the sectarian problems

1081
00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:26,569
and the problem between Iran and the

1082
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:28,609
Gulf countries and Iran is making a lot

1083
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:30,859
of mistakes but on the other hand we

1084
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:32,689
shouldn't forget the realities yeah but

1085
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:34,339
you're very quickly on concept I'm I'm

1086
00:44:32,689 --> 00:44:36,229
abusing the fact that I'm out of office

1087
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:38,869
forgiven no don't worry you said we want

1088
00:44:36,229 --> 00:44:40,578
you to use it I I think I agree with

1089
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:42,170
with with the relative growth I mean I

1090
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:44,089
think Iran has been thing a negative

1091
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:46,039
role but I think the main feature of

1092
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:48,019
this negative role has been to sectarian

1093
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:49,459
eyes all these little hotspots and

1094
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,738
conflicts and I think it is our

1095
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:53,328
collective responsibility to D sectarian

1096
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:56,269
eyes and Reaper lettuce eyes it's being

1097
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:57,920
sectarian eyes again witness the Riyadh

1098
00:44:56,269 --> 00:45:01,459
the Riyadh summit but if we could take

1099
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,859
it yes with with your presence because

1100
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:06,019
you have a real life experience to this

1101
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:07,939
question about whether a country like

1102
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:09,319
Iran part of the homegrown solution is

1103
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:10,759
part of the problem or part of the

1104
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:12,769
solution turkey made the strategic

1105
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:15,259
choice to work with Russia it mustn't

1106
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:16,879
have been easy to shift course we saw

1107
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:18,589
the end of the battle for Aleppo we saw

1108
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,569
the Atlanta agreement now you're working

1109
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:23,660
with Iran as well can you tell all of us

1110
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:26,779
here that you believe Iran can be part

1111
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:30,109
of the solution it is not a strategic

1112
00:45:26,779 --> 00:45:33,140
choice we had to work with Russia to

1113
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:37,058
overcome the situation when Aleppo was

1114
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:41,808
surrendered and for more than 40 type of

1115
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:44,749
45,000 innocent people were under the

1116
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:46,969
risk and we had to evacuate these people

1117
00:45:44,749 --> 00:45:50,660
to ever irrigate them we needed a

1118
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:53,209
ceasefire in Aleppo and that's why we

1119
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,219
started working with Russia and Russia

1120
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:58,069
actually delivered what they promised

1121
00:45:55,219 --> 00:46:00,939
and while we were evacuating those

1122
00:45:58,069 --> 00:46:05,660
people both Iran and the regime try to

1123
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:08,580
actually damage this agreement and they

1124
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:11,060
try to actually block the

1125
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:15,660
occasion and Russia threatened them and

1126
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:18,840
once we made that when once we advocated

1127
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,899
these people and we decided to work

1128
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,780
together to extend the ceasefire other

1129
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,300
conflicting areas between the regime and

1130
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:30,780
the opposition that's why we brought two

1131
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:33,750
armed groups and the Russian military

1132
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:36,630
and other intelligence people and

1133
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:39,090
together with ours together in Ankara

1134
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:42,540
and at the end they signed those and the

1135
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:45,290
understandings of first ceasefire and

1136
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:49,380
the political process and that's how

1137
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:52,050
Astana process started meanwhile of

1138
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:55,140
course we saw the negative role of Iran

1139
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:58,140
continued because they don't they didn't

1140
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:01,560
want Russia and Turkey worked on this

1141
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:03,299
and they encouraged regime to violate

1142
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,190
the ceasefire

1143
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,710
even though regime sign the document and

1144
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:13,110
Russia was guarantor and at the end we

1145
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:15,090
also decided to include Iran now Iran is

1146
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:17,910
officially guarantor Iran signed the

1147
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:21,660
documents and we will see what Iran is

1148
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:23,640
going to deliver we have to see that and

1149
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,129
about the question mark is still there

1150
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,109
still there but you're but you have an

1151
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:30,690
experience of trying to get them on

1152
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:33,300
board we have the time is short

1153
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:35,460
the ladies and gentlemen we we have one

1154
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,500
more issue we should discuss as part of

1155
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:41,130
this all too short panel and that is to

1156
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:42,750
say that even with the big military and

1157
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:46,010
political questions that we've heard

1158
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:48,240
about and social questions the EU

1159
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:50,550
announced the earlier this year that it

1160
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,879
wanted to start looking sensitively

1161
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:55,650
carefully about Russian getting

1162
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,840
countries to start rebuilding in a

1163
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:59,820
country like Syria even though the war

1164
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:03,900
was not yet over but the needs are still

1165
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:06,780
great how do you do that well you need

1166
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:09,480
funds you need a mechanism we've had a

1167
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,730
suggestion from the young leaders forum

1168
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,470
here in from Bratislava about something

1169
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,940
called a Marshall Plan interesting

1170
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:16,350
enough from what I've read of your

1171
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,150
document you're you're sitting in that

1172
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:20,310
row you don't want this so-called

1173
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,660
Marshall Plan to work in areas of

1174
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:24,808
conflict including Syria

1175
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:26,788
but I want to give the floor to one of

1176
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:29,640
you to just sort of tell us where do you

1177
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:30,780
see if there is to be funds to start to

1178
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,160
go to some of the countries in the

1179
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,119
Middle East which would they go to first

1180
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,859
and how would it happen

1181
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,829
which one of you would like to speak

1182
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:41,250
just to put another ingredient into our

1183
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:48,450
discussion are you the youngest in the

1184
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:50,819
young leaders forum okay just leave us

1185
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,259
with a thought or two well essentially

1186
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:54,480
it would be very difficult to

1187
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,859
concentrate on the conflict areas

1188
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,839
because obviously there is very complex

1189
00:48:55,859 --> 00:49:00,000
gear politics there and to be very

1190
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,828
difficult to try to rebuild while some

1191
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,869
other people are trying to blow up what

1192
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:06,030
we are trying to rebuild so it might be

1193
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:07,710
advisable to start with the easier path

1194
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,839
so we can think of Libya where the

1195
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:11,730
conflict seems to be maybe as easy well

1196
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,440
much easier than Syria for example and

1197
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:15,630
think about the awful geopolitics of

1198
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,280
Syria or of Iraq Libya is complex

1199
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,260
mirrors got a bit easier and then

1200
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,359
there's obviously Lebanon in the receipt

1201
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,130
Jordan for example so country it might

1202
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,779
need to be propped up so there are ways

1203
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,369
to kind of gradually start the process

1204
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,220
early or late the big conflicts would

1205
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:31,619
also kind of start to slow down or at

1206
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:34,020
least or eventually come to an end so

1207
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:36,150
then we can move in this direction of

1208
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,920
kind of doing something more positive in

1209
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,809
Syria so you want to start up a new kind

1210
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,369
of it's like a new big fund which is

1211
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:43,650
you're gonna call it the new Marshall

1212
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:46,410
Plan well that's more a symbolic name

1213
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,299
which kind of wants to send a positive

1214
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:49,859
message not necessarily to replicate the

1215
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:51,450
original Marshall Plan which is very

1216
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:53,460
different thing obviously so you want

1217
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:56,160
the EU to take the lead and you want the

1218
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:58,319
bank and the u.s. even though the US has

1219
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,759
made it clear they're not into large

1220
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,380
sums of money for nation-building

1221
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,170
reconstruction deal with that problem

1222
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,039
later World Bank others I want Tareq

1223
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,990
what do you think you think this is

1224
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,380
going to wash this kind of an approach

1225
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:15,379
will is the region ready for this kind

1226
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:15,380
of a this kind of a fund no

1227
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,779
you should fight for it I'll say why

1228
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,069
again I hope I'm wrong actually we

1229
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:21,400
discussed you can convince him he's

1230
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:23,619
wrong

1231
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,960
yes I really hope I'm wrong but very

1232
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:28,210
briefly assuming there's money but

1233
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,770
that's a big assumption assuming there

1234
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:31,930
is money and some of that money people

1235
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:34,000
keep saying is in the Gulf for example

1236
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:36,490
potentially but I'm not particularly

1237
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,079
sure that the pockets of money whether

1238
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:40,660
in the Gulf or in Europe or in the US or

1239
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,279
together have the same strategic

1240
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,190
objectives in the region so pulling them

1241
00:50:42,279 --> 00:50:46,750
together is one a challenge to I think

1242
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:49,299
specifically if you start talking about

1243
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:50,980
partial plan unless I'm mistaken but

1244
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:52,059
when the Marshall Plan was implemented

1245
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,109
in Europe you were talking about

1246
00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:55,079
countries that had certain

1247
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:57,700
infrastructure human talent

1248
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:01,029
competitiveness ability to export that

1249
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:03,250
is we are way behind that so also the

1250
00:51:01,029 --> 00:51:05,710
the fruits of that would be big question

1251
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,930
mark 3 so a very large extent you do not

1252
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,220
have you have nice leaders in different

1253
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,230
parts of the Arab world but to be very

1254
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:13,839
blunt you do not have necessarily a

1255
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:15,520
corner of an hour type of a leader that

1256
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,740
you saw in Germany is able to pull

1257
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:21,250
together and lead in that sense and

1258
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:24,220
finally to very large extent also you do

1259
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:26,950
have many I think problems on the ground

1260
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,720
in different parts of where these money

1261
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:30,970
is supposed to go to that would make

1262
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,950
many of the funders in Europe or even in

1263
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:34,808
the Gulf and certainly in the US have a

1264
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:37,538
lot of question marks regarding their

1265
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:39,849
commitment putting money into into a

1266
00:51:37,539 --> 00:51:41,799
fund like that especially at a time when

1267
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:44,140
the economic situation in these

1268
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:46,150
countries themselves the founders is

1269
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:49,029
certainly by far by far worse than it

1270
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:52,029
was 60 or 70 years ago the one thing

1271
00:51:49,029 --> 00:51:53,740
that I put as positive in my view at

1272
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:57,490
least is not necessarily a Marshall Fund

1273
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:58,990
in that mindset but to look again at the

1274
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,759
demographics of this part of the world

1275
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,740
and how young the people are and how

1276
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,200
immense opportunities are there and

1277
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,660
invite a number of the private sector

1278
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,368
players in many countries in the West

1279
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,140
and say look even if you invest in

1280
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:13,900
countries that are stable Jordan for

1281
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:15,879
example and for others you will have a

1282
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,640
ripple effect on the ground that I think

1283
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:21,460
will lay a bit of green shoots that in

1284
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,710
the future could do a okk have a

1285
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:26,349
positive yield to my mind that's the

1286
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,400
most realistic eponymously but even so

1287
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:28,569
I'm not so good

1288
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,190
now sir Judi will know that the

1289
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:32,529
international community came together in

1290
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:34,569
a new pact with Jordan and Syria to find

1291
00:52:32,529 --> 00:52:36,579
a new economic model to put money into

1292
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:39,038
the region so that refugees were not

1293
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:41,529
fleeing where the seeds a map that

1294
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:43,539
somehow we fit can be translated into

1295
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:45,039
this broader called it the Marshall Plan

1296
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,869
call it the new kind of plan for the

1297
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:50,859
Middle East absolutely right but when

1298
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:52,630
when when the world came together to to

1299
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:54,609
produce the Jordan Compact I mean the

1300
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:58,900
idea was addressing the you know the

1301
00:52:54,609 --> 00:53:00,940
root causes of of many things but

1302
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,109
specific in one area and I think when

1303
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:04,420
we're talking about a Marshall Plan for

1304
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:07,119
the for the region it's an overarching

1305
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,430
thing and the question that I would ask

1306
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,339
is if we do it at the wrong time what

1307
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:13,899
are we funding it's all about the right

1308
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:17,380
time and it's all about you know the

1309
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:21,279
environment being conducive and it's all

1310
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:23,200
about stability in certain countries as

1311
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,819
a prerequisite for having this market

1312
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,598
plan so that we can reap the most

1313
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:30,579
benefits out of outwards but the one

1314
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:32,650
ingredient that made that work was that

1315
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:35,499
Europe realized in particular Britain

1316
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:37,390
that if it didn't help the region the

1317
00:53:35,499 --> 00:53:39,129
refugees would be coming to Britain so

1318
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:41,049
Britain saw it was in its interest and

1319
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:42,730
maybe that is what that is what has to

1320
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:44,859
be necessary that the the rest of the

1321
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:46,420
world has to understand they have to

1322
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:48,130
help the region otherwise the region

1323
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,239
will be coming to them with all of its

1324
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:53,079
problem well that's exactly the point

1325
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:54,789
that's putting it through a quick quick

1326
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:56,559
thought on this is that it's no longer

1327
00:53:54,789 --> 00:53:58,299
an individual country responsibility for

1328
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,420
a shared global responsibility and the

1329
00:53:58,299 --> 00:54:05,589
cost of a refugee yes in Syria yeah is

1330
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:08,349
ten times less than the cost in Germany

1331
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:10,869
or in another European countries yes I

1332
00:54:08,349 --> 00:54:12,549
think we should go far turkey spent 26

1333
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:15,059
billion dollars for the refugees in

1334
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:18,009
Turkey can you imagine what we can build

1335
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:19,480
with that much money and we've spent a

1336
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:20,859
similar amount you look at the size of

1337
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,499
our economy compared to Drake yes

1338
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:25,450
absolutely and Deborah and Jordan and

1339
00:54:23,499 --> 00:54:27,939
director I think we should commend the

1340
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:31,529
efforts of globe sex young leaders forum

1341
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,529
for putting your mind

1342
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,759
because I think you know what is needed

1343
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:38,830
is keep the plan alive yet no no yes yes

1344
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,270
did you want to just a brief comment

1345
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:42,460
from you or one of your colleagues we've

1346
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:46,120
got some very good suggestions been

1347
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:47,380
brutal but some situations for go back

1348
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:51,040
to the drawing board and rethink about

1349
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:56,020
needs to be a solution in some way you

1350
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:58,080
want to just very briefly we definitely

1351
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:01,720
would not like to sound as naive because

1352
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:04,090
we were given this task of a discussing

1353
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,740
martial plan and then we collectively

1354
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:09,220
almost unanimously decided that it would

1355
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:11,319
not be a the right wrist pay for the

1356
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,230
middle ISA the time being and we

1357
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,420
discussed with was with a mr. Tonko

1358
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:19,540
smart and we've decided that it wasn't

1359
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:21,760
really the right choice we later decided

1360
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:25,300
that it would be it would require a

1361
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,340
determined political solutions with baby

1362
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:30,040
steps maybe and some sort of

1363
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:32,500
infrastructure investments rather than

1364
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,370
an overarching martial plan okay and

1365
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,120
what country are you from

1366
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:40,089
awesome Turkey from all that's but he

1367
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:42,400
has MIT connection oh we all have

1368
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:44,230
accents and you're from the country I'm

1369
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,700
Bulgarian your Bulgarian well your you

1370
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:47,430
both you probably ministers by the time

1371
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:50,169
the Middle East is ready for some time

1372
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,700
after your job your excellency it's one

1373
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:53,830
small point we think of this as a

1374
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,120
long-term process so essentially even if

1375
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:57,430
you start with small steps it's going

1376
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:01,839
somewhere no you have to start somewhere

1377
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:04,089
yes exactly exactly what to come back

1378
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm sorry I'm sorry but we're we don't

1379
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:08,590
have a lot of time left I'm just

1380
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,730
wondering whether we're now just like an

1381
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,720
auction everyone is putting up their

1382
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,720
hand because they know that it's about

1383
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,120
to be sold um this gentleman here had

1384
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,669
his hand up first but he didn't take one

1385
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:20,230
comment from the floor this tallit this

1386
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,120
to know this the tallest the man who

1387
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:24,820
must be on the globe sec basketball team

1388
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:27,759
right here thank you

1389
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,650
i have one one question the communist is

1390
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,390
that we agree that we all failed in

1391
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:34,060
public opinion european and the middle

1392
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:35,799
east all so respected leaders need to

1393
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:38,799
confirm for me that we all failed in

1394
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:41,050
public opinion but a profit in public

1395
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,789
opinion now i'm making it public opinion

1396
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:45,279
means that we failed in fact

1397
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:47,979
to come for a solution killing the food

1398
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:50,079
soldier is not a solution as you all say

1399
00:56:47,979 --> 00:56:52,689
it in fact that would definitely they

1400
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,249
will hunt us back so it is not the

1401
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:56,558
responsibility of the Middle East and

1402
00:56:54,249 --> 00:56:59,049
it's the entire world problem so the

1403
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,640
problem in the West also a lot of

1404
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:03,219
recruitment has been done in fact from

1405
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,499
the West so the only thing that we

1406
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:07,719
failed the leaders field in fact to come

1407
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:09,910
with a narrative to understand that this

1408
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:11,529
narrative is getting hit in fact by a

1409
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:14,709
lot of leaders by a lot of countries

1410
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:16,059
that even we named it Saudi Arabians

1411
00:57:14,709 --> 00:57:18,129
some other countries they were in fact

1412
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:21,009
financing sponsoring or if not directly

1413
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:23,529
some elements were sponsoring why are we

1414
00:57:21,009 --> 00:57:26,589
still afraid of this dimension and

1415
00:57:23,529 --> 00:57:28,749
target and expose those countries that

1416
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:31,359
they are the main problem

1417
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:33,308
they are financing so the issue that

1418
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:34,959
you're it's like Middle East is made

1419
00:57:33,309 --> 00:57:37,719
which country are you from I'm coming

1420
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:39,879
from Afghanistan oh so okay let's thank

1421
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:42,099
aim for that so the problem we get at it

1422
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,929
out that that is not easy to solve it in

1423
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:45,160
Afghanistan the problem is now in the

1424
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:46,719
state and Europe and all the other

1425
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,308
countries recruit means number you see

1426
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,679
that in from Europe going on okay so

1427
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:52,329
okay so how do you find the solution why

1428
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:54,279
don't you expose that one that that is

1429
00:57:52,329 --> 00:57:57,069
worldwide problem that is not the Muslim

1430
00:57:54,279 --> 00:57:59,769
process we are failing to find the right

1431
00:57:57,069 --> 00:58:01,630
narrative - who are financing and giving

1432
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:02,799
the narrative to these guys okay you

1433
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,509
will thank you very much thank you very

1434
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,819
much in other words you cannot tell I

1435
00:58:04,509 --> 00:58:08,409
don't I don't agree with you that the

1436
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:10,538
countries that you mentioned are

1437
00:58:08,409 --> 00:58:13,539
sponsoring those terrorist organizations

1438
00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:16,359
first of all those tell those terrorist

1439
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:20,289
organizations be - or al-nusrah whatever

1440
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:23,169
it is PKK YPG FET oh they are posing

1441
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:25,150
first and foremost direct threat to

1442
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:27,129
those countries Saudi Arabia why Saudi

1443
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:29,229
Arabia or an other country should

1444
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:32,259
finance the terrorist organization

1445
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:35,049
posing the threat targeting themselves

1446
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:38,199
so this is the rhetoric actually

1447
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:41,439
circulated in Western countries and also

1448
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:43,089
between sometimes between the Muslim

1449
00:58:41,439 --> 00:58:45,368
countries as well to accuse each other

1450
00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:48,819
whenever they disagree on this and that

1451
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:52,179
also between Iran and also Gulf

1452
00:58:48,819 --> 00:58:54,880
countries about I don't agree with you

1453
00:58:52,179 --> 00:58:56,800
that these terrorist organizations are

1454
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,680
sponsored by Muslims

1455
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:04,990
but I agree with you that why those

1456
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:06,368
people are choosing - to join but not

1457
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:08,740
only - why

1458
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:10,660
other foreign terrorist fighters are

1459
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:13,598
coming to join different groups

1460
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:20,160
including YPG or other groups sometimes

1461
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:24,609
regime or Hizbollah or Revolutionary

1462
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:26,770
Guards of Iran or why foreign terrorist

1463
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:29,369
fighters were going to eastern part of

1464
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:32,849
Ukraine to fight each side there were

1465
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:36,730
35,000 foreign terrorist fighters and

1466
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:39,310
99% of them were not Muslim and why are

1467
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:41,710
Korean or Japanese are coming all the

1468
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:43,509
way from Asia and to join - or other

1469
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:46,390
terrorist organization this is another

1470
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:49,089
question and of course unless we kill

1471
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:52,868
the ideology of dice - we'll continue

1472
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:55,810
hiring radicalized people from many

1473
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:59,470
source countries and according to our

1474
00:59:55,810 --> 01:00:03,400
statistics there are foreign terrorist

1475
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:05,049
fighters coming from 125 countries we

1476
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,640
have this statistic because we stopped

1477
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:09,460
them at the borders we captured them and

1478
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:12,460
we deported them deport them to the

1479
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:14,440
source countries so from 125 countries

1480
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,540
the born terrorist fighters are coming

1481
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,640
to join but with all due respect sir

1482
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:20,349
you're absolutely right that there's

1483
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,118
countless numbers of foreign fighters

1484
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:24,369
coming from all across the world

1485
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:26,200
majority Muslim majority Christian but

1486
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:28,060
you will have known directly from a

1487
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,939
country like Syria and from Afghanistan

1488
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:34,599
where you had saudi arabia qatar united

1489
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:36,940
arab emirates iran financing supporting

1490
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:38,560
different groups and whether or not they

1491
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,630
were extremists at the start they became

1492
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:44,500
more radicalized and had a huge impact

1493
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:46,750
on the countries in question do you not

1494
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,300
see that as being perfect if you mean

1495
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:52,079
the moderate forces of free syrian army

1496
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:54,730
no no no as you know that this is no not

1497
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:57,339
the legitimate opposition by everybody

1498
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:59,109
artemis or entirely sharm and all the

1499
01:00:57,339 --> 01:01:01,060
different manifestations a battle Nostra

1500
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:05,430
is listed as terrorist organizations

1501
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:07,290
for instance Turkey listed both - and

1502
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:10,290
nutria le monstre s terrorist

1503
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:11,759
organization even before many countries

1504
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:15,839
didn't know the name of these terraces

1505
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:19,040
in 2013 so both of them are terrorist

1506
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:21,450
organizations and nobody can I mean no

1507
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:24,150
country can sponsor those terrorist

1508
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:26,430
organizations and any country supported

1509
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:27,930
supporting in any means with any means

1510
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:29,940
those terrorist organs and should be

1511
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:32,220
accountable one of the most difficult

1512
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:36,349
tasks that Jordan was assigned in one of

1513
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:38,459
the ISSG meeting was to coordinate

1514
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:41,880
between the different members of the

1515
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:43,530
ISSG as to you know which organization

1516
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,660
was to be labeled as a terrorist

1517
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:47,099
organization and which organized we

1518
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,390
coordinated Delavan we ended up with a

1519
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:50,069
lot of disagreement winter come because

1520
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:54,868
it took forever it took months advancing

1521
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:57,480
well how many names mentioned 107 107 my

1522
01:01:54,869 --> 01:01:59,640
group actually nominated by different

1523
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,170
countries I think you're very remember

1524
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,910
that but I think this does point out a

1525
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:05,220
fundamental issue you cannot have a

1526
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:06,990
homegrown solution unless you have a

1527
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:09,209
better understanding of what the

1528
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:11,160
homegrown problems are they the two are

1529
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:12,720
inextricably linked and I think this is

1530
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,420
part of the discussion I'm just going to

1531
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:21,209
take one one from here in the front to

1532
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:22,380
have a gender balanced please give your

1533
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:25,740
name and where you're from yeah I am

1534
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:29,670
some kid V from UAE I think we met in

1535
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:32,578
Riyadh those I'm just objecting when you

1536
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:34,170
listed also UAE as one of the country is

1537
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:37,589
funding the terrorist group they're not

1538
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:39,420
only playing a role they they do but

1539
01:02:37,589 --> 01:02:41,369
they have concerns about some groups

1540
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:45,119
funded by snow but then not the debtors

1541
01:02:41,369 --> 01:02:46,319
group there and we have never I did that

1542
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:48,630
I didn't say terrorist

1543
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,940
I said fun helping different groups and

1544
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:54,740
user a terrorist please regret just my

1545
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:58,349
question to your excellency miserable

1546
01:02:54,740 --> 01:03:01,890
when was the turning point for Turkey

1547
01:02:58,349 --> 01:03:05,010
turning to find it fighting Isis before

1548
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:05,549
that Isis was coming from the Turkish

1549
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:09,240
border

1550
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:11,339
when was the turbine and Isis we've seen

1551
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,890
the photos all up in Istanbul they were

1552
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:15,230
there when when did you feel that no

1553
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,569
Isis

1554
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:20,210
dangerous group and you have to fight

1555
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:23,420
from the beginning there was no turning

1556
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:27,170
point I just said that turkey list is -

1557
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:30,320
or Isis as terrorist organization even

1558
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:33,680
you UAE doesn't know the name of - it

1559
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:36,440
was 2013 and since then we have been

1560
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,750
fighting - since then we have been

1561
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,490
actually doing our best to stop the

1562
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:44,780
foreign terrorist fighters flow and

1563
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:48,410
there are 55,000 people in within the no

1564
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:51,110
entry list we have captured and deported

1565
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:55,310
more than 4,000 foreign terrorist

1566
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:57,350
fighters in Turkey and those terrorists

1567
01:03:55,310 --> 01:04:00,140
who are responsible for the attacks in

1568
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:02,660
Paris and Brussels actually were

1569
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:04,850
deported by Turkey to those countries at

1570
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,770
the beginning they were not taking this

1571
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:08,779
issue very seriously into account and

1572
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:11,780
when I asked them why they were coming

1573
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:13,940
to my border my airport I was deporting

1574
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:16,430
them and eventually they were coming to

1575
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:19,160
my airport and I was questioning my

1576
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:21,169
colleagues probably Nasser was there why

1577
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,420
they how come they are coming back

1578
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:25,520
freedom of movement they were saying

1579
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:27,530
freedom of movement to the terrorists

1580
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,540
foreign terrorist fighters but thank God

1581
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,640
I'm not I'm not happy with the terrorist

1582
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:34,070
organization but thank God due to the

1583
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:36,759
bad experience now or source countries

1584
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:38,890
are taking this issue very seriously

1585
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:43,880
intelligence and timely information

1586
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:46,970
sharing is very important and - no other

1587
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,920
country has killed more than turkey -

1588
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:52,220
elements modern Turkey we have killed

1589
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:55,640
more around $3,000 elements in Syria and

1590
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:56,779
more than 700 - elements brother Mustafa

1591
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:01,339
was also in Iraq

1592
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:04,550
it's almost 4,000 - terrorist v/q which

1593
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:07,610
other countries killed that many -

1594
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:10,670
terrorists sofa so there was no turning

1595
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:15,200
point for us from the beginning from the

1596
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:18,440
beginning we listed and when - even when

1597
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:21,140
- actually kept my consulate people of

1598
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,630
muscle as hostage I was participating

1599
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:28,100
the International Syria support group

1600
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:28,820
and also coalition meetings against -

1601
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:31,700
and

1602
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:33,440
I was sharing my concrete proposal have

1603
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:38,210
to defeat this terrorist organization

1604
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:39,890
and Nasser is one of the witness okay

1605
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:41,480
ladies and gentlemen discipline is part

1606
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:44,270
of democracy as well we have seven

1607
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:47,030
minutes left so I'm going to just get

1608
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:48,950
from you our distinguished participants

1609
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:50,690
a little bit of a Middle Eastern miss a

1610
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:52,250
a little a little bit of a contribution

1611
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:54,050
from both of you just to add to the

1612
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:56,000
discussion very quickly otherwise you'll

1613
01:05:54,050 --> 01:06:00,380
never talk to me again from here and

1614
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,180
then here yes good afternoon constantly

1615
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:04,250
negative on Moscow have one short

1616
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:06,770
observation and one question the

1617
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:09,080
observation is Minister Chavez shoe glue

1618
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:11,720
was constantly referring to the Astana

1619
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,640
process which as many people see it is a

1620
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:16,040
counterbalance to the Geneva process I

1621
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:18,160
think that the old Russian wisdom says

1622
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:21,770
you have two processes you have none

1623
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:24,230
they kind of cancel it out and that

1624
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:26,120
leads me well it's I just invented a

1625
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:29,390
company good I'm good at inventing

1626
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:32,540
Russian folk oh I was a German name that

1627
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:35,830
usually goes well and my question is

1628
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:39,800
actually how do you see the role of

1629
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:41,900
Russia in the Syrian conflict because it

1630
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:44,030
doesn't from the domestic point of view

1631
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,650
doesn't look as if what the Emir Putin

1632
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:48,350
really wants to settle it because it

1633
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:49,580
works for him very well and the big

1634
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:52,009
white elephant in the room is the role

1635
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:56,779
of America how many point that's your

1636
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:58,880
dish in the meze Johnson aisle I think

1637
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:03,680
my question is directed John Jenkins was

1638
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:05,690
suspiciously quiet and can you what role

1639
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,149
do you see for the Europeans apart from

1640
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:10,310
the discussion that we had about the

1641
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:12,320
European Union and financial questions

1642
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:14,900
what role do you see perhaps for

1643
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,380
individual key European countries or for

1644
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:22,180
the European Union as a whole in this

1645
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:22,180
situation at the moment okay hi

1646
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:29,800
and then you and then the yes please

1647
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:31,390
hello I'm Anna from Lebanon a skier that

1648
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:35,500
we're living in a period of making

1649
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:37,150
stability great again but if we if I

1650
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,730
want to look at homegrown solutions

1651
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:42,160
homegrown means people means people's

1652
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:44,020
positions and ideas being represented in

1653
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,299
shaping the future of their country ie

1654
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:49,300
democracy at the same time if the major

1655
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:51,430
players are the world's top jailers of

1656
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:53,440
journalists countries where freedom of

1657
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:56,500
expression freedom of the press human

1658
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,270
rights records gag orders are very

1659
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,040
common I mean human rights violations

1660
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:01,390
are very common with the situation in

1661
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,190
Egypt we know what it is the situation

1662
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:05,049
in the Gulf countries no I mean we all

1663
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:06,850
know what it is if these are the

1664
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:08,530
guarantors of a political solution that

1665
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:10,900
is democratic and truly representative

1666
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:12,490
of people's will I mean there are plenty

1667
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:14,470
of question marks related to the

1668
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:16,089
viability especially that we're not

1669
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,979
looking at the day after but the 25

1670
01:08:16,089 --> 01:08:19,089
years after thank you exactly part of

1671
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:21,129
the diva okay and this will be the last

1672
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:23,080
one the man with the red tie and your

1673
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:25,359
name John Hudson with BuzzFeed news in

1674
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,339
Washington for foreign minister

1675
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:29,890
cavusoglu the New York Times this

1676
01:08:27,339 --> 01:08:32,399
morning put into plain view the brutal

1677
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:36,370
tactics that President or want guards

1678
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:38,799
used against protesters not party in DC

1679
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:41,439
a State Department also condemned those

1680
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:43,149
tactics uh you know is there still any

1681
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:46,120
remorse from on the part of the Turkish

1682
01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:47,259
government Judas I'd be remiss yeah I

1683
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,259
would just be remiss if I didn't bring

1684
01:08:47,259 --> 01:08:52,930
up the President Trump just earlier

1685
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:55,149
today hailed the electoral victory of a

1686
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:57,640
man Montana congressman who body-slammed

1687
01:08:55,149 --> 01:09:00,399
a journalist suit any comments on that

1688
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,950
as well no the second one I think where

1689
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:05,410
is beyond the scope of this of this

1690
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:06,309
civil society um what do I agree with I

1691
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,630
agree it's a very very important point

1692
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:11,980
very very important point in terms of

1693
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:14,799
democracy and human rights John Jenkins

1694
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:16,809
role of Europe uh you know this is

1695
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:20,290
generational and I think one of the

1696
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:21,520
problems for politicians especially in

1697
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:23,019
the conditions of the modern world is

1698
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,850
they want something that happened today

1699
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:27,520
or tomorrow it's this it's this

1700
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:29,020
inability to sustain attention over a

1701
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,430
long period and what we're looking at in

1702
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:33,339
the Middle East is a very long period of

1703
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:34,609
reconstruction I hope or it's not

1704
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:36,559
reconstruction

1705
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:39,619
continuing disaster I don't think it is

1706
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:42,679
it is the Marshall Plan idea is it

1707
01:09:39,618 --> 01:09:44,509
itself a ludicrous idea because

1708
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:46,670
fundamentally what we've what we've seen

1709
01:09:44,509 --> 01:09:48,529
in this region is the collapse of

1710
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:51,290
governance in certain states and this is

1711
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:52,940
not governance this is not the states or

1712
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,170
borders or emotions like speaker because

1713
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,820
they look alike speaker did never

1714
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:57,409
implemented what happened the 1920s was

1715
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:59,389
different you're looking at the collapse

1716
01:09:57,409 --> 01:10:00,920
of certain states which emerged in the

1717
01:09:59,389 --> 01:10:02,630
aftermath of the Second World War a

1718
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,460
certain model of governance which is

1719
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:07,760
represented by nasa's egypt but has

1720
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:10,610
designed severe by by by the by the work

1721
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:13,639
of a broken glass and the art of mothers

1722
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:14,780
and saddam is saying that has gone so

1723
01:10:13,639 --> 01:10:16,670
what you're looking at to the longer

1724
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:19,849
term and you can you can't kill

1725
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:21,710
ideologies what you can do is deprive

1726
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:24,139
them of oxygen of the goblet of the of

1727
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:26,929
the grounds where they breathe and to do

1728
01:10:24,139 --> 01:10:28,400
that you need to reconstruct or in some

1729
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:31,639
cases I think in Libya actually

1730
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:33,469
construct a proper state if you look at

1731
01:10:31,639 --> 01:10:36,710
what everybody voted for in those

1732
01:10:33,469 --> 01:10:38,869
elections in 2011 onwards in Egypt in

1733
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:40,489
Libya elsewhere they voted for better

1734
01:10:38,869 --> 01:10:41,599
governance they voted for something that

1735
01:10:40,489 --> 01:10:43,699
was going to give them a better tomorrow

1736
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,020
than their yesterday they didn't vote at

1737
01:10:43,699 --> 01:10:46,669
you for the Muslim Brotherhood Neda they

1738
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,360
voted because they wanted they thought

1739
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,739
they were going to get a government

1740
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,929
apply to something better than they had

1741
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:52,669
which was which was which proved to be

1742
01:10:50,929 --> 01:10:54,500
false but that's what they were looking

1743
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,670
at so when you think of what the

1744
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,960
Europeans should do and I mean the

1745
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:58,610
Europeans have been talking about a role

1746
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,440
in the Middle East for everyone a day

1747
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:02,750
ever since I joined a diplomatic service

1748
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:04,040
in 1980 at the time of the Venice

1749
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:06,409
declaration and this has been something

1750
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:09,230
with it and yet there hasn't really been

1751
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:11,509
one I'm mark after will will will will

1752
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:13,428
perhaps bear testament to this the

1753
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:15,110
search for European role in the Middle

1754
01:11:13,429 --> 01:11:18,260
East I think you have to be limited on

1755
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:20,059
what you try and do personally if I'm if

1756
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:22,610
I was advising mogherini or what to do

1757
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:25,389
I'd say refugees and Libya

1758
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:26,540
I think Libya actually is something

1759
01:11:25,389 --> 01:11:29,330
doable

1760
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:31,429
John Turk Usman if there is to be a long

1761
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:35,239
term homegrown solution must also

1762
01:11:31,429 --> 01:11:37,070
include respect for human rights yes of

1763
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:38,959
course but I think the really issues at

1764
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:40,519
this stage we're not the solutions if

1765
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,679
you'd like if there are solutions in be

1766
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,300
in the medium term I think more in the

1767
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:46,610
long term will not come from the states

1768
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,920
I think the most interesting things that

1769
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:50,019
are happening in the Middle East

1770
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,030
right now are actually not even the

1771
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:54,010
Wardrobe they're all of religion in the

1772
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:55,780
Middle East is Islam and Christianity by

1773
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,699
the way is evolving in extremely

1774
01:11:55,780 --> 01:12:00,009
interesting ways and I think some of

1775
01:11:57,699 --> 01:12:01,660
that will feed more violence sadly in

1776
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:03,730
the eastern Mediterranean and in North

1777
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:05,530
Africa in the next 10 or 20 years but I

1778
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:07,959
think we will see some sort of a final

1779
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:09,820
coming together between 150 years

1780
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:12,040
problem that has existed in the Middle

1781
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:13,469
East since the mid 19th century of the

1782
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,489
role of religion we see more of

1783
01:12:13,469 --> 01:12:18,640
interesting solutions coming from young

1784
01:12:15,489 --> 01:12:20,080
people the young people may demand

1785
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,000
freedom of the press freedom of

1786
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,590
association it's even coming to

1787
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,480
Theological innovation there are so many

1788
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,920
things happening in that sphere I think

1789
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:29,110
the nature of the state itself there's

1790
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,390
somebody from Lebanon Lebanon has been

1791
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:33,580
an extremely interesting example of

1792
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:35,920
forging a new form of the state and in

1793
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:37,360
my opinion the fact that did not have a

1794
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,949
present for two and a half years now

1795
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,389
they have one that they not debating a

1796
01:12:38,949 --> 01:12:41,830
new election law what I'm trying to say

1797
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:43,870
is that you'd find I think new

1798
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:46,059
interesting not new borders but new

1799
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:47,769
forms of governance that are appearing

1800
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:49,300
in the Middle East very new not coming

1801
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:51,460
from the state coming from young people

1802
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,810
most of the socio-economic problems that

1803
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,850
people were talking about a Marshall

1804
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:56,380
Plan in my view will not come from the

1805
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:57,570
West or from the nation states of the

1806
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:00,640
region will come from entrepreneurs

1807
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:02,530
social and business in the region it or

1808
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,750
not to talk forever the solutions in my

1809
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:07,059
opinion are not in the short-run most

1810
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:09,340
likely not in the medium run and to my

1811
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:11,500
mind almost certainly not coming top

1812
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:13,030
down but bottom up we're seeing that in

1813
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:16,120
Mosul already the private sectors

1814
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:23,019
already urbanizing not so liquid for yo

1815
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:24,250
just the wave see what you use and no

1816
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,929
King Abdullah visits air more than

1817
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,340
Washington very much about I think you

1818
01:13:25,929 --> 01:13:30,070
mentioned reconstruction I just want to

1819
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:30,760
say very quickly in most cases we're not

1820
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:32,340
just talking about physical

1821
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,320
reconstruction we're talking about

1822
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,730
reconstruction and in some cases

1823
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,040
construction not reconstruction there

1824
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:40,928
are countries that had have not seen

1825
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,429
political institutions the likes of

1826
01:13:40,929 --> 01:13:44,410
which we are all used to so you're

1827
01:13:42,429 --> 01:13:47,080
talking about construction not just

1828
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:49,630
physical construction and Russia's role

1829
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:52,870
is is key in my opinion we've maintained

1830
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:54,340
that all along the my good friend

1831
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:57,010
mentioned that if you have two processes

1832
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:59,940
then you have none I have to say I mean

1833
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:01,739
I don't have all the information

1834
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:03,750
readily available these days but I have

1835
01:14:01,739 --> 01:14:05,160
to say that Geneva was about the larger

1836
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:06,719
picture it still is about the larger

1837
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,639
picture it's still alive it hasn't

1838
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,580
kicked off yet but as Donna is a

1839
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:13,680
different thing it's about operational

1840
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:15,330
measures that can be taken while we

1841
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:17,400
anticipate the larger picture to be

1842
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:18,630
resolved so I think and when we're

1843
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,650
talking about de-escalation when we're

1844
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:22,080
talking about some of the practical

1845
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:23,790
steps that we saw in in Syria on the

1846
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,410
ground as the necessarily came in to

1847
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,760
help but the larger picture of course

1848
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:29,160
the political transition the political

1849
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:31,340
solution is the Geneva process so let's

1850
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:34,559
hope that you have two processes that

1851
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:36,949
complement each other rather than cancel

1852
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,670
each other out here new Russian wisdom

1853
01:14:36,949 --> 01:14:39,960
your excellency

1854
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:41,760
there's a number of questions directed

1855
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,070
you but human rights and something which

1856
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:47,160
happened far away in Washington even

1857
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:50,610
Montana well I would leave it you we

1858
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:52,710
made the official statement about our

1859
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:55,290
position so this is not the platform to

1860
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:58,949
discuss bilateral issues here so I just

1861
01:14:55,290 --> 01:15:01,219
keep this question and with regards to

1862
01:14:58,949 --> 01:15:04,110
the construction or reconstruction

1863
01:15:01,219 --> 01:15:07,050
construction of to construct the Auris

1864
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:09,989
construct the country we need to reach a

1865
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:12,449
solution and we need to bring stability

1866
01:15:09,989 --> 01:15:15,540
and security unless we ensure that we

1867
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:18,629
cannot rebuild or rebuild or reconstruct

1868
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:21,449
the country until we reach that at least

1869
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:25,199
we can start with the safe zones which

1870
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:26,790
this idea gets more support now we have

1871
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:29,460
been defending this idea from the

1872
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:31,739
beginning that including our ally United

1873
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:34,530
States more and Germany and more more

1874
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:38,070
more more countries supporting this idea

1875
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:40,860
but we need to implement it and with

1876
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:44,429
regards to astana process Astana is not

1877
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:49,679
an alternative to Geneva but Astana

1878
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:54,030
helped to resume Geneva talks and both

1879
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:56,790
Astana and Geneva talks are moderated by

1880
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:58,769
United Nations we made sure that in by

1881
01:15:56,790 --> 01:16:01,620
United Nations and demonstra is

1882
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:04,680
moderating and Astana is a kind of

1883
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:07,530
confidence-building measure platform for

1884
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:10,070
confidence-building measures and also

1885
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:13,230
the doors agreement the last agreements

1886
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:13,558
we signed if they are implemented will

1887
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:15,718
be

1888
01:16:13,559 --> 01:16:20,969
very helpful actually to start to

1889
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:24,839
meaningful talks negotiations in in

1890
01:16:20,969 --> 01:16:27,419
Syria with regards to Russia for sure

1891
01:16:24,839 --> 01:16:30,030
Russia wants to maintain his presence in

1892
01:16:27,419 --> 01:16:32,389
Syria and I see that including the

1893
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:37,978
United States nobody is against it and

1894
01:16:32,389 --> 01:16:41,089
to maintain its presence Russia wants to

1895
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:44,639
reach up political solution as well I

1896
01:16:41,089 --> 01:16:48,539
have no doubt that regime is for

1897
01:16:44,639 --> 01:16:51,419
military solution and its supporters as

1898
01:16:48,539 --> 01:16:53,459
well but I know that Russia is for a

1899
01:16:51,419 --> 01:16:56,039
political solution because the military

1900
01:16:53,459 --> 01:17:02,760
solution has been a tremendous cost for

1901
01:16:56,039 --> 01:17:05,969
Russia so far thank you and you're

1902
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,619
actually just I'm on your point is is

1903
01:17:05,969 --> 01:17:09,389
noted the buzzfeed question we hope you

1904
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:11,459
get an answer somehow when you're when

1905
01:17:09,389 --> 01:17:14,280
you're here just leave it you can read

1906
01:17:11,459 --> 01:17:14,579
my statement of my ministry on that

1907
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,518
issue

1908
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:19,259
um just leave us with one last thought

1909
01:17:17,519 --> 01:17:21,929
you began by saying you don't agree with

1910
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:23,729
the what the American decision to work

1911
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:25,289
with the Syrian Kurdish forces just

1912
01:17:23,729 --> 01:17:28,139
leave all of us do you think this can be

1913
01:17:25,289 --> 01:17:31,530
resolved such that the battles in Syria

1914
01:17:28,139 --> 01:17:34,619
can go forward just short the muscle

1915
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:36,209
example missiles should be taken an

1916
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:39,749
example in Raqqa as well

1917
01:17:36,209 --> 01:17:43,639
and now Raqqa is surrounded and there

1918
01:17:39,749 --> 01:17:48,478
are also Arab elements within SDF and

1919
01:17:43,639 --> 01:17:51,599
more than 60% so the YPG can stay around

1920
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:53,609
and Arab elements should go in the city

1921
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:56,249
and after the operation the

1922
01:17:53,609 --> 01:17:59,129
administration of muscles shall be left

1923
01:17:56,249 --> 01:18:01,469
at the local people ladies and gentlemen

1924
01:17:59,129 --> 01:18:04,679

1925
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:07,979
problem our session is short and the

1926
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:09,899
