00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:23,210
ladies and gentlemen welcome once again

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:23,210
justin vault one hello good morning

3
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:30,448
let's please welcome uh thank you so

4
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,488
much I'd like to congratulate you all

5
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,890
for getting in your seats this morning

6
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:37,949
with a minimum of pushing and shoving

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,280
this is an important skill to have I'm

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,910
glad that we all demonstrated it we are

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,620
very lucky very lucky to be joined by

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,230
one of the most interesting members of

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,959
the US Senate mr. Ron Johnson the

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,000
senator from Wisconsin thank you so much

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,789
for coming senator that's happy to be

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,059
here appreciate the invitation I want to

15
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,680
just kind of jump right into this right

16
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,518
now u.s. foreign policy seems to be more

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,420
sort of up for grabs than it has been in

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,810
recent memory President Trump came in

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,060
and his ideas about US foreign policy or

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,330
sometimes sort of hard to pin down

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,430
sometimes it seems like he wants to make

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,080
a radical break from tradition other

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,030
times especially when you strip away the

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,000
rhetoric the position seemed fairly

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,130
conventional fairly traditional it's

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,650
hard to know so it seems to me that this

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,658
kind of creates an opportunity maybe

28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,759
even a responsibility especially for

29
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,000
those in the Republican Party like

30
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,140
yourself to help define a more sort of

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,320
coherent approach and you have suggested

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:50,659
and some speeches you've made and talks

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,548
you've given a concept that recalls a

34
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:55,770
Reagan era line peace through strength

35
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,270
but you've modified that a little bit by

36
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,270
wanting to talk about peace through

37
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,860
economic strength so I'd like to start

38
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,649
with that and I'd like to ask you to

39
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,030
sort of unpack that transgression for us

40
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,399
what is peace through economic strength

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,709
what does that mean well first of all

42
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,940
there's no way you can have military

43
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,870
strength if you're not strong

44
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,609
economically

45
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,709
and if you take a look at just the way

46
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,370
the world has been set up for us here

47
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:22,319
where America has you combine America's

48
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,420
size of its economy with the size of the

49
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,000
European economy so over 30 trillion

50
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,559
dollars large Russia depending on how

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,910
you measure it somewhere around two

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,220
trillion probably less than two trillion

53
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,440
and look who's pushing who around right

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,390
now so just on the basis of economic

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,890
strength

56
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,958
obviously the reason America is the

57
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,988
world superpower is is we are sort of

58
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,030
the last large economy standing but now

59
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,390
other economic powers are rising whether

60
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,200
it's China obviously Russia is just

61
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,480
rising its influence through its

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,220
aggressiveness so it starts the economic

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,738
strength and just based on the last

64
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,930
panel listening to General Allen talking

65
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,030
about stability but also looking

66
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,840
upstream when he's looking upstream in

67
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,640
this whole evolution of radicalism

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,590
it starts with economic strength the

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,170
diverse economy having the Gulf states

70
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,690
for example utilize their oil wealth to

71
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,268
diversify their economies now just real

72
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,130
just basic in order to have an economy I

73
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,010
think you need three basic pillars you

74
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,470
need security you need labor and you

75
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,440
need capital you know security is by the

76
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,019
you know is more than just national

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,370
security homeland security it's also

78
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,560
security and certainty of the rules of

79
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,840
the road you know to have yes we need

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,000
some regulations but we don't want you

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,970
know a massive over-regulation you need

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,069
a benchmark competitive taxation system

83
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,230
so you can compete globally so there's a

84
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:45,149
lot packed into security but that is the

85
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,730
first pillar then of course you need

86
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,919
workers and you need capital and a

87
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,540
regulatory burden reduces your capital

88
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,150
an uncompetitive tax system also reduces

89
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,679
your capital so if you really try and

90
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,930
simplify things on from a macro

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,599
standpoint security labor and capital

92
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,290
that's what provides the economic basis

93
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,819
for being strong to hopefully prevent

94
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,810
anybody from ever challenged you

95
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,910
militarily

96
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,139
that's for my stamp bet that's how you

97
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,209
achieve peace okay

98
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,799
so you know we have this expression in

99
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,168
the states right like it's hard to argue

100
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,358
against mom and apple pie right it's

101
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,978
it's hard to argue against a military

102
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,599
strength and economic strength the

103
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,909
question is the details so you mentioned

104
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,889
a couple of things regulatory burdens

105
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:27,060
was going on first thing Gmail

106
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,919
what are that what are some of the

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,689
regulations that you think are currently

108
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,998
holding back economic so let's just talk

109
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:35,039
in the United States yes there have been

110
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:36,569
multiple studies that peg the cost

111
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:39,090
complying with federal regulations

112
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,529
around two trillion dollars per year now

113
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,090
you know certainly in our political

114
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,469
environment people are getting immune to

115
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,210
these massive numbers I mean how can

116
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:47,189
even calm contemplate what two trillion

117
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,930
dollars is but that's a number larger

118
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:50,490
than the Russian economy for example

119
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,870
there are less than ten economies as

120
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,150
large as two trillion dollars and yet

121
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,219
that is the burden America is placing on

122
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,388
itself through over-regulation it's

123
00:04:56,219 --> 00:05:00,449
about fourteen thousand eight hundred

124
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,500
dollars per year per household I was

125
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,289
talking to one Wisconsin paper

126
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,659
manufacturer he did cost again just for

127
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:08,340
regulations recently issued under the

128
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:09,599
Obama administration cost his business

129
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,659
the equivalent of twelve thousand

130
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:14,250
dollars per year per employee so in

131
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:16,560
America we're concerned about wage

132
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,150
stagnation if you're concerned about

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
wage stagnation look no further than

134
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,219
that

135
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,620
fourteen thousand eight hundred dollar

136
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:25,110
per year per household regulatory burden

137
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,330
and and there's so many of them

138
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,580
I mean it's across the board all these

139
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,169
government agencies I think that's also

140
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,180
a problem I don't want to be critical of

141
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,549
any other I'll be critical critical of

142
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,110
the United States regulatory burden but

143
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,259
let's face I think that's one of the

144
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:43,129
reasons perhaps that Britain decided to

145
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:46,680
exit the EU is just the bureaucratic

146
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:49,199
build up within Brussels and that's not

147
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,860
good for any economic activity okay the

148
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,719
second thing you mentioned was

149
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,620
competitive tax people in this room a

150
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,199
lot of the folks in this room are

151
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,339
familiar with a VAT something we don't

152
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,199
have in the US but it's part of Paul

153
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,629
Ryan who's from your state of Wisconsin

154
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,020
it's the border adjustment tax was sort

155
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,250
of variant of that you wanted the taxes

156
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,289
in the US would be more competitive do

157
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,089
you favor the Ryan plan the Trump plan

158
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:14,789
some other plan I've got to some other

159
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:16,289
plan okay actually so in my business

160
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:18,180
life and by the way I'm not really of

161
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,759
this world I'm really an accountant by

162
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,649
education manufacturer by vocation so I

163
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,729
didn't never involved in politics until

164
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:28,259
I ran for the United States Senate in

165
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:31,370
2010 and so I organize my businesses as

166
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,599
a c-corp as an S Corp and also as an LLC

167
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,690
there have been multiple studies that

168
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,430
show that it's not the C Corp the burden

169
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,409
of Taxation doesn't fall on the piece of

170
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,779
paper that is the corporate

171
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:44,509
charter employees and consumers pay the

172
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,879
corporate tax in higher wages or lower

173
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,469
wages and higher consumer prices so my

174
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,029
concept would be rather than have

175
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:51,949
employees and consumers pay the

176
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,459
corporate tax let's make the owners pay

177
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,679
the tax

178
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,089
now I'll stick it to Warren Buffett this

179
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:57,768
would be a true Warren Buffett accent

180
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:00,139
case anybody in America thinks that's

181
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:02,719
radical 81% of businesses have their

182
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,069
income tax exactly like that there's so

183
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:06,349
many benefits to it you eliminate the

184
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,509
double taxation of dividends you do end

185
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:11,089
up taxing worldwide income so you remove

186
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:13,269
the barrier for from you know various to

187
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:15,499
a free flow of capital across borders

188
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:19,039
actually we've had some initial scores

189
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:20,989
the distribution benefits of this type

190
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,909
of tax plan is very equally distributed

191
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:24,979
with low income individuals benefiting

192
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,498
slightly more because the way you

193
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:29,508
collect the tax would be a 25% backup

194
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:31,339
withholding paid by that C corporate in

195
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,050
the federal government so let's say year

196
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:36,709
of a little lady in Oshkosh Wisconsin

197
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,779
where I'm from at a 10% tax rate you'll

198
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:41,419
get attributed $100 worth of income for

199
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:43,969
your ownership in that company $25 in

200
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,948
tax has already been paid but then your

201
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:47,539
tax rates 10% you'll get $15 refund

202
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:49,939
whereas a Warren Buffett's going to have

203
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:52,248
to kick in probably another 10% so it

204
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,669
says it's a very it's actually taxing

205
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:57,379
corporate income on a progressive scale

206
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:59,769
very growth warning orienting because

207
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,879
it'd be based on cash flow she'd

208
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:03,349
anticipate how much cent expensing which

209
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,319
is probably the greatest growth

210
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,219
pro-growth tax reform you can do so

211
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,469
again this is a completely different

212
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:11,029
concept okay it's gaining some traction

213
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:12,709
I've been talking to a lot of economists

214
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:14,569
and hopefully that might be Plan B if

215
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:16,309
the other plans aren't passable its

216
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:17,599
border adjustment part of that no no

217
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:19,999
okay

218
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,739
you also talk about energy resources you

219
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,499
mentioned energy resources which energy

220
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:27,948
resources you have in mind first of all

221
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:30,019
America is blessed with a bounty of

222
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,159
certainly fossil fuel resources we

223
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,269
should use those in an environmentally

224
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:37,208
friendly way you know right now oil

225
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:39,558
prices are about half of what they were

226
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:42,138
even though OPEC and Russia is trying to

227
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:43,879
restrain production you know why aren't

228
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:46,309
our prices going up with that restrained

229
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,170
productions because America through

230
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:50,360
innovation through horizontal drilling

231
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,939
and fracking fracking has become the

232
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,800
other the third world superpower well

233
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,310
to fossil fuel energy we should use

234
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,520
those resources it's stabilizing in in

235
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,219
terms of economic growth so you need you

236
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,290
know from my standpoint economic growth

237
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,720
regulatory reform we need pro-growth tax

238
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,949
reform and we should use in America our

239
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,460
energy resource are you worried about

240
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,850
carbon emissions climb has always

241
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,530
changed I'm not a denier I more or less

242
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,380
adhere to the bureau and Lamberg

243
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,540
approach from the Copenhagen consensus

244
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,189
where he's totally in you know agrees

245
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,839
that it's man-made global warming I'm

246
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,820
probably little more skeptical but I

247
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,310
have got an open mind on that but from

248
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,930
my standpoint as Bjorn points out when

249
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,150
you have limited resources

250
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,930
you're trying to use to alleviate human

251
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,449
suffering

252
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,010
there's far better ways to employ those

253
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,600
resources digging wells

254
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,939
you know combating malaria combating

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,470
aids you're probably better off doing

256
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,360
that and then allowing human beings to

257
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,150
adapt one little stat I throw out there

258
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,260
is if you can actually believe we can

259
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,510
measure temperatures accurately a

260
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,460
hundred years ago the global has warmed

261
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,050
the world is warmed by about one point

262
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,970
seven degrees right over the last

263
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,589
hundred years life expectancy is

264
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,240
increased by more than 30 years so I

265
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,610
actually have a great deal of faith in

266
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,040
human innovation another point to make

267
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,590
as well as climate is ah has changed

268
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,390
20,000 years ago in my state my state

269
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,600
was pretty well covered by a mile thick

270
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,430
glacier so I mean there are other larger

271
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,260
forces are causing those glaciers recede

272
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,510
and the sea level in the Bay of San

273
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,310
Francisco about 20,000 years ago was 400

274
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,170
feet lower than it is today but just as

275
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,849
the baseline you do do you or do you not

276
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,589
agree that human activity is the main

277
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,180
driver today of climate I wouldn't I

278
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,220
would not agree that's the main driver

279
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,599
obviously man affects the environment

280
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,490
I'm a little more skeptical that I'm

281
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,110
primarily skeptical can we really do

282
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,360
anything about it we got seven billion

283
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,580
people on this planet we've got

284
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,580
economies that are growing in India and

285
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,440
China we are a fossil fuel based economy

286
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,120
we will be a fossil fuel based economy

287
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,480
really until those resources run out

288
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,770
I'm all for alternate uses of energy but

289
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,180
I'll let the marketplace pretty well

290
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,290
dictate that what would you tell

291
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,420
President Trump about the Paris

292
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,890
agreement on climate change there are a

293
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,890
lot of people saying well there's really

294
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:04,939
no mandates coming out of that in terms

295
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,830
of us spending we're pretty well on our

296
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,899
way to complying with whatever the

297
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,550
the dictates were of co2 emissions

298
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:13,220
primarily because the marketplace and

299
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,500
and the horizontal drilling fracking we

300
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,300
have enormous natural gas resources and

301
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,130
just because the marketplace is

302
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,069
dictating our utilities are switching

303
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:24,320
from coal to natural gas so maybe it

304
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,660
might be best just to stay involved that

305
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,640
but if there's anything in those Paris

306
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,040
Accords it would cause America or force

307
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,209
America to you know spend hundreds of

308
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,310
billions of dollars trying to hold back

309
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,750
the tides I'd be opposed to it but it's

310
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,699
kind of above my pay grade he'll make

311
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,839
his own decision okay but there as far

312
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,100
as we know there aren't those kind of

313
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,269
mandate so that's kind of beauty of the

314
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,560
agreement so maybe just well in in some

315
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,240
respects kind of uselessness of the

316
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,089
agreement why is that you thought that

317
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,950
ruthless okay yeah I mean I think that

318
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:55,370
was one of the criticisms about is is

319
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,930
you were trying to self impose a number

320
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,880
of limits who could really cost us

321
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,769
economically which reduces our economic

322
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,460
strengths without strength which I would

323
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:03,170
reckon

324
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,779
[Music]

325
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,519
and there's really no requirements on on

326
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:09,769
these other economies that are growing

327
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,690
and spewing out all kinds of co2 okay

328
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,250
let's talk about trade for a second and

329
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,190
the role that trade plays in your vision

330
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,570
piece of economic strength when we make

331
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:22,700
it specific about let's talk about NAFTA

332
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:25,640
NAFTA is NAFTA unbalanced been good for

333
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,990
Wisconsin I believe so yes and listen I

334
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,370
you know in my business we probably

335
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,180
exported more than 20 different

336
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,610
countries I think you have to have free

337
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,640
trade I think it does rise it lifts all

338
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,620
boats it's got to be fair though and I

339
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,930
think America because we are the world's

340
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,610
largest economy I think we have been

341
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,079
very magnanimous over the years and I

342
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,899
think people have taken advantage of us

343
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,430
and so there's the problem in promoting

344
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,250
free trade is there's it's very easy to

345
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,649
point to a plant that closes in a state

346
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,839
and you know a similar plant opens up in

347
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,880
Mexico or China or India or something

348
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,370
like that so it's very easy to use those

349
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,890
anecdotal stories to you know really

350
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,480
oppose free trade it's far more

351
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,459
difficult to make the case that in a

352
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,890
generalized sense everybody is better

353
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:12,290
off I would say and this is really

354
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,360
referring back to of general Allen's

355
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,550
comments when you're looking upstream

356
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,220
and you're looking at the the real root

357
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,250
cause of for example radicalization its

358
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,650
lack of economic

359
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,240
opportunity now a lot of people would

360
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,620
say what America ought to do or the West

361
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,020
ought to do is invest in those economies

362
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,860
you know like we're hearing that right

363
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,180
now in Central America

364
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,010
let's take billions of dollars and

365
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,359
invest in those economies well they

366
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,650
don't have the security they don't have

367
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,390
the public institutions to handle those

368
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,760
investments I would think a far more

369
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:42,000
efficient way of investing those

370
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,710
economies is engaging in free trade you

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,820
know opening up your markets I don't

372
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,350
think it makes a whole lot of sense for

373
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,960
example for American workers

374
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,910
or any developed country workers to be

375
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,910
producing high labor content product

376
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,069
you'll let the developing countries that

377
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,829
have all kinds of labor let them produce

378
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,660
those high labor content products trade

379
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:03,060
with us and we can put our employers

380
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,740
employees to Fargo or our workers to far

381
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,260
greater use in higher value-added

382
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,890
products so again so yeah I think free

383
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:13,740
trade is really in general the best

384
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,330
cure-all for growing economies around

385
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,680
the world I think it's the more moral

386
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,910
thing to do it's an interesting way to

387
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,979
look at it what do you say though to the

388
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,250
people in Wisconsin say but those high

389
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,660
labor products I want to make them and I

390
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,820
used to have a job making them and now I

391
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,350
don't or you have people in Europe say

392
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
the same thing what's the response to

393
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,470
them how do you get them on the same

394
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,510
page I think that is why you have things

395
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,980
like trade assistance and you do try and

396
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,870
help those displaced workers because

397
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,930
let's face that there are winners and

398
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,120
losers in any kind of free trade but the

399
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,870
main winner is just the global economy

400
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,670
and consumers so yeah I mean I think we

401
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,610
have more than enough resources for

402
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:54,209
retraining short-term assistance

403
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,250
programs to take care of those just you

404
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,360
know those types of dislocations we

405
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,370
talked about NAFTA what about the other

406
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,210
side of the globe was the right decision

407
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,950
to pull out of TPP I'm happy to have

408
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,540
president Trump negotiate a better deal

409
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,030
I think one of the problems in these

410
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,709
massive trade deals is you have so many

411
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,470
different trading partners so many

412
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,600
different self interests that in the end

413
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,100
the deal may not work out particularly

414
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,470
well you might be better off breaking

415
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,589
those into parts but from my standpoint

416
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,790
we've got engaged in free but fair trade

417
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,100
certainly America I would say you know

418
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,199
Europe as well we can't be on the

419
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,970
outside looking in some of these large

420
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,680
markets as other people start engaging

421
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,180
in different trade deals of their own so

422
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,640
I'm again I'm for free but fair trade

423
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:40,359
how about TTIP well same thing I mean

424
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,069
right right now I think that obviously

425
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,690
we have a change administration guide

426
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:47,740
elections going on in Europe it's

427
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:49,870
incredibly complex trade negotiation and

428
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,690
then you need unanimous approval within

429
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,130
the EU that's hard to get and in order

430
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,890
to get unanimous approval it's going to

431
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,149
be a far from perfect deal so again I've

432
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,470
got an open mind I mean should we be

433
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:02,020
doing these large trade deals are we

434
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,450
better off breaking off into pieces but

435
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,920
I think Europe I think America because

436
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,010
we have the strongest economies in the

437
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,790
world we should be leaders when it comes

438
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,290
to trade but then we should expect other

439
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,089
economies the people that are taking

440
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,370
have been taking advantage of more open

441
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:22,540
trade like China like India that they

442
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,520
have got to be high integrity actors on

443
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,079
the world stage and that's one of my

444
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,270
problems with China is they do not

445
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,950
protect intellectual property we have

446
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,010
seen with cyberattacks

447
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:37,089
the theft let's face it I mean it was

448
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:39,339
our NSA director said that it's the you

449
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:41,230
know cyberattacks cyber theft represents

450
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,330
the greatest truck transfer wealth in

451
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,400
human history that's a real problem so

452
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,440
we do we do need all of our trading

453
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,880
partners to have high integrity and

454
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,160
really abide by the rules and not engage

455
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,900
in trade abuses the last panel we spend

456
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,089
a lot of time talking about defense

457
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,380
spending and we were talking about NATO

458
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:57,690
allies trying to get their defence

459
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,830
spending up to that 2 percent target

460
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,620
you've talked about defense spending in

461
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,290
the US as part of this vision of

462
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,540
economic piece of economic strain let me

463
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,800
you think broadly speaking the United

464
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,688
States should spend more on defense I

465
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,659
think we have to it's a very dangerous

466
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:15,429
world but but to start this conversation

467
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,520
let me acknowledge because we don't

468
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,660
acknowledge it enough our NATO partners

469
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,280
have sent their sons and daughters and

470
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,620
they paid the ultimate price anything

471
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,209
it's somewhere around a thousand sons

472
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,339
and daughters of our NATO partners have

473
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,380
paid that ultimate price far more than

474
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,570
that have been injured so that's I mean

475
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,440
there is no there is no price you can

476
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:37,780
put on that type of sacrifice but no you

477
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,740
know I think we are living in a

478
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:45,240
dangerous world I mean the threat of

479
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:47,710
radicalized violent extremists is is

480
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,100
from my standpoint growing it's evolving

481
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,160
it's

482
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:54,879
a sizing and we need our first line of

483
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,650
defense is very effective intelligence

484
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,150
gathering and sharing between countries

485
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,919
we have to have that trust because

486
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,230
that's our first line of defense so

487
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,940
specifically if we were going to spend

488
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,710
more on defense the u.s. defense budget

489
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,929
is going to go up what would that money

490
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,309
be spent on what should it be spent well

491
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:10,929
first of all I'd say missile missile

492
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:12,639
defense you know I'm not on armed

493
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,740
services I'd never serve the military so

494
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm not a military expert but you've got

495
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,910
to take a look and project in the future

496
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,470
you know where the threats going to come

497
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,150
from and right now you take a look at

498
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,580
North Korea that's a growing Menace

499
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,929
growing threat we I don't think we've

500
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,178
been spending enough on missile defense

501
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:30,460
it would be less of a threat if we had a

502
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,110
more robust missile defense system we

503
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,799
have to look to space I mean that is

504
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,080
obviously we have enormous enormous ly

505
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,429
important assets in space and need to be

506
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,889
protected and we need to understand that

507
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:45,130
that's going to be a a kind of a vital

508
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,990
area of future military conflict as well

509
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,610
so you've got to look ahead and and

510
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,409
we've really got to get our act together

511
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,260
when it comes to cyber security and

512
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:54,250
that's a more difficult issue so those

513
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,419
are two areas where I think missile

514
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,409
defense cybersecurity that would be

515
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:57,789
where if you were looking at

516
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:58,780
appropriations or debating that that's

517
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:00,340
where you'd be wanted to see those

518
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,320
resources go yeah but then you also need

519
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,459
connect conventional forces and you are

520
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,500
going to have to fight you know

521
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,780
conventional types of kinetic military

522
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,830
activity president Truong proposed

523
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:14,440
budget includes roughly 30% cut in the

524
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,678
State Department's budget do you think

525
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,730
that's a good idea I don't think there's

526
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,010
any agency in the federal government

527
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,650
that spends efficiently so I'm happy to

528
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:26,260
look at any agency and you know take a

529
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,870
pretty sharp pencil to it and you know

530
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:31,240
certainly pare back but yeah I'm a

531
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,639
fiscal conservative on the I ran for two

532
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,289
reasons Obamacare I knew would not work

533
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,900
and those markets are collapsing in fact

534
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:39,879
we're more general kids future we're 20

535
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,440
trillion dollars in debt today the

536
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,600
Congressional Budget Office projects in

537
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,299
the future over the next 30 years the

538
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,760
u.s. is projected to incur another 129

539
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:51,039
trillion dollars where the deficits the

540
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,120
problem in our own budgetary process and

541
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,429
thus probably getting in the weeds for

542
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,590
European audiences less than 30 percent

543
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:58,510
of our budget is appropriated seventy

544
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,610
percent is all the mandatory spending

545
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,090
programs completely out of control until

546
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,250
we get serious about that

547
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,709
90% of the budget the pressure on the

548
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,480
remaining 30% is going to be just

549
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,370
continue to grow and that's what you're

550
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,679
seeing in president Trump's budget

551
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,989
proposal but being a fiscal conservative

552
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,330
I'm also the first to say that foreign

553
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,940
aid if it's spent well is money well

554
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,799
spent and so you know we do have

555
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,570
multiple branches of government involved

556
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:25,730
in this process I think there's enough

557
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,649
of us Lindsey Graham I think is in

558
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,809
charge the procreation subcommittee when

559
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,720
it comes to the State Department he will

560
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:35,090
defend and I'll help him defend

561
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,860
certainly soft power and things like

562
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,428
foreign aid where we can project our

563
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,439
values through you know well spent for

564
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:43,730
and aid dollars as opposed to having to

565
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,340
spend probably more on military

566
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,169
engagement yeah well there's a general

567
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,049
mattis at the time general mattis now

568
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:53,539
secretary minutes you know famously said

569
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:55,730
the quote is he said if you don't fund

570
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:57,980
the State Department fully then I need

571
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,270
to buy more ammunition ultimately so I

572
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,409
think it's a college benefit ratio the

573
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,730
more that we put into the State

574
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:03,140
Department's diplomacy hopefully the

575
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,750
less we have to put into a military

576
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,210
budget roughly I think that's you know

577
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,940
one thing to kind of provide some

578
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,380
comfort to European audience take a look

579
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,919
at who president Trump is surround

580
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,230
himself take a look at a security team

581
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,630
these are solid individuals that really

582
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:23,000
have a from my standpoint a very

583
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,890
grounded understanding of the world the

584
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,140
secretary that I'm dealing with mostly

585
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:30,200
is the secretary Kelly a four-star

586
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,820
general gold star parent had a Southern

587
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,740
Command I can't think of somebody more

588
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,230
qualified this moment time to be head of

589
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,730
department homeland security these are

590
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,100
individuals that do not necessarily

591
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,830
agree with what candidate Trump said on

592
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,270
the trail and yet he still put them in

593
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,879
their positions and he's listening to

594
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,379
them and modifying his position so you

595
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,659
know coming from the private sector from

596
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,580
the business world entering politics you

597
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:54,740
know cold-like present Trump I'm

598
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,689
actually pretty sympathetic with the

599
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,000
very sharp learning curve he's going to

600
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,840
have to undergo and let's face it there

601
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,360
are now a lot of people that aren't

602
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,090
making it real easy for him to kind of

603
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,590
ease into that learning curve so again

604
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,110
I'm I want to cut them a little more

605
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,520
slack I'm looking at the advisers and

606
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,168
they're just first-class individuals

607
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,000
with the great deal knowledge that I

608
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:15,290
think have a probably more mainstream

609
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,390
view of what our four

610
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,030
policy ought to look like well let's

611
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,920
talk about NATO action and on that theme

612
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,360
did the president send the right message

613
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,700
with his with his speech at the NATO

614
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,979
summit this week I want to pull out a

615
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,750
quote at the beginning of his speech he

616
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,300
acknowledged that the only time NATO has

617
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,960
ever invoked article 5 was in defence

618
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,970
after 9/11 it trust me that has a great

619
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,790
deal of resonance in America at the very

620
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,230
tail end of his speech this is his quote

621
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:48,139
he said we will never forsake the

622
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,760
friends who stood by our side now from

623
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,890
my standpoint that's maybe a little more

624
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,629
eloquent way of saying you know yeah

625
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,970
we're going to will stand by article 5

626
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,400
the whole speech the whole event was

627
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,630
about article 5 so yeah from my

628
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,030
standpoint I think that I was all blown

629
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:05,150
out of proportion that he didn't say the

630
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,560
magic words I think he did and certainly

631
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,780
members of the administration came out

632
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,300
and said no it's obvious so I don't know

633
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,470
how many times you know people refuse to

634
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,840
take yes for an answer

635
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,480
but no I mean one of the reasons I came

636
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,399
here to this conference was to provide

637
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,000
that reassurance you know on a unanimous

638
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:27,730
basis for example we talked about this

639
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,730
in the green room and this is

640
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,660
extraordinary and codels have gone into

641
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,960
Ukraine but to congress's ago we passed

642
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:39,100
a 300 million dollar authorization for

643
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,870
lethal defensive weaponry for Ukraine

644
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,000
unanimously people don't realize how

645
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,409
extraordinary that is but I think it

646
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,270
shows and then with the following

647
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,190
Congress we pass a resolution to

648
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,230
reaffirm that that authorization I was

649
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,190
never used by the past administration

650
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,500
we've done a pretty good job I think

651
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,000
helping train Ukrainian soldiers they

652
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,550
try and maintain their territorial

653
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,220
integrity but not you know I think

654
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,800
Congress is is basically basically

655
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,080
unanimously in support of our NATO

656
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,450
alliance support of our long term

657
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,070
commitment within the EU as well it does

658
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,660
it say something though that you

659
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,710
mentioned the 300 million our Ukraine

660
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,110
does it say something that that's

661
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,760
extraordinary that that that that that

662
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,610
should be considered an achievement

663
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,840
I mean well in take a look I think are

664
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,490
some our NATO allies we're not in

665
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,590
support of that so one of the reasons

666
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,450
probably President the Obama

667
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:28,399
administration did not utilize the

668
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,059
authorization is you know other people

669
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,100
it

670
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:33,379
in the Alliance in Europe we're saying

671
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,539
oh you know we can't win a an arm's

672
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:37,370
build-up I disagree with that position

673
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:41,120
but no I think it was pretty

674
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:44,120
extraordinary let me ask you just very

675
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,789
broadly a general question and and you

676
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,709
know we're talking about Trump were

677
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:49,999
talking about NATO how would you

678
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,620
describe you've described your sort of

679
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,039
vision quite well I think about how to

680
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,258
do this

681
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,240
what is your baseline understanding of

682
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,259
what his approach to foreign policy is

683
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,210
and what his vision is how would you

684
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:00,919
describe how when you're here and and

685
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,450
and your you know how and people say

686
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:04,009
what what's going on there what are the

687
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,980
words you used to describe first of all

688
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:08,240
take a look at what his background is he

689
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,159
was in real estate he was a tough

690
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,330
negotiator he wrote the book are the

691
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,830
deal

692
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,269
it was interesting as I was going

693
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:18,049
through the campaign tough campaign

694
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:20,240
Wisconsin his fervent supporters never

695
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,220
really took some of his statements as

696
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,399
that was his position for example we're

697
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,019
going to be slapped 35% tariffs on

698
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:29,479
imported goods that they view that as an

699
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:31,340
opening negotiating position and I think

700
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,899
that's kind of his approach to things

701
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,840
to take him seriously but not literally

702
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:37,668
well know that they take they take

703
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,709
seriously the factor that's his opening

704
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,909
negotiating position which is different

705
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,470
the business world then maybe in

706
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:44,179
diplomacy where you kind of start with a

707
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:47,029
I mean here's where we ant want to end

708
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:48,409
up in negotiation you maybe sometimes

709
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:50,389
start with a pretty outrageous demand to

710
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:51,679
get to where you want to go so again I

711
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:53,479
don't want to cycle I you know

712
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,950
psychoanalyze him but you know I'm jaded

713
00:25:53,480 --> 00:26:00,369
I'm just giving I'm just giving you my

714
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:03,409
kind of my perception of it but you know

715
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:05,629
that that's his you know basic approach

716
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:07,190
and as a candidate when he gave a speech

717
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:09,678
on foreign policy and he said America

718
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,499
has to be more unpredictable my first

719
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,360
reaction is wrong answer me I think

720
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:16,009
America has to be far more predictable

721
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,229
when we draw a red line people need to

722
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:19,820
understand we're going to maintain the

723
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:23,389
red line and if you cross over it

724
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:25,189
something's going to happen now I'm

725
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:26,479
assuming when he's saying be

726
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,330
unpredictable it's what's going to

727
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,950
happen afterwards okay and then I don't

728
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,360
disagree with it from that standpoint

729
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,919
but we need we need to be very

730
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,350
predictable we need to be respected

731
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,269
maybe a little more unpredictable in

732
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:41,240
terms of our responses but I think it's

733
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:43,940
very important that when we had proof

734
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,080
again of chemical weapon use in Syria

735
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,600
President Trump did exactly what

736
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,178
President Obama didn't do which was act

737
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,408
swiftly not come running for Congress

738
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,669
and get an authorization you probably

739
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,200
never would have gotten because so much

740
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:56,909
time has run out and they've moved the

741
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,169
military assets and it just wouldn't

742
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:58,740
make the statement that needed to be

743
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:00,779
made

744
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,070
president Trump acted very swiftly and I

745
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,409
think that will probably pay dividends

746
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,749
long-term and as he continues to to work

747
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:08,460
with other into other potential

748
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:10,970
adversaries but that's interesting do

749
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:15,450
you think had Assad used chemical

750
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:17,610
weapons as he did more recently well

751
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:21,210
Obama was still president this is after

752
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,439
we had supposedly overseen these you

753
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,639
know the disarming do you think that

754
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,590
Obama would not have done almost

755
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:26,908
precisely what Trump did know about what

756
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,830
Obama would have done is what he always

757
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:30,559
does he would get make a speech and say

758
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,689
they're going to be serious consequences

759
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,908
and people got that and they realized

760
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:37,230
yeah I can I can handle somebody saying

761
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:38,820
verbally there's going to be serious

762
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,379
consequences and then never following up

763
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,549
on it you're president Trump

764
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:44,009
demonstrated there are serious

765
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:46,168
consequences any acted decisively and

766
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,460
swiftly and that's I think what America

767
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,330
needs to do let's talk about this

768
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,100
predictability question related to NATO

769
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:55,259
what what is basically happening and as

770
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,699
ROS got another pointed out before you

771
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,320
notice a message the United States been

772
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,450
sending to NATO allies for a long time

773
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,980
get the spending on spending up we set

774
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,309
this target in 2006 we've got to get

775
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,950
closer

776
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:06,720
Bob Gates said it one way Donald Trump

777
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,789
says it slightly different way my

778
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,350
question for you is what should happen

779
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:15,149
if that target that if our allies don't

780
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,100
get for you want you talking about

781
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:19,289
sending a credible message of a credible

782
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,899
threat what's what's the what's the

783
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:23,970
stick behind the carrot well hopefully

784
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:26,209
there won't have to be a stick but let

785
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:30,240
me just explain why that's so important

786
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:32,419
you know America we have spent over the

787
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,700
decades a tremendous amount of our

788
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:37,379
taxpayer money yeah we you know back in

789
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,950
the 60s actually let me get out my sheet

790
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:43,379
again here okay just throw some facts on

791
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,480
the table in the I'll start with the 70s

792
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:49,379
on average America spent about five

793
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,789
percent of our GDP on our military the

794
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:52,439
height was seven point six percent

795
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:54,869
Carter dropped it down to four point

796
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,730
four and then the world became more

797
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:59,250
dangerous America was less less

798
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,620
secur and so Ronald Reagan came in

799
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,210
boosted military spending in the 80s to

800
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,790
about 5.5 percent with a high mark of

801
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,470
six percent you know the Soviet Union

802
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,049
collapsed which was I think was a good

803
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,370
thing because then we the West you know

804
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:13,230
reached our hand out and said come on

805
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,320
Russia come on in to integrate your

806
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,030
economy let's let's let's build together

807
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,220
unfortunately Vladimir Putin hasn't

808
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,928
accepted that outstretched hand the way

809
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,059
he should have in the 90s

810
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:26,669
now after that end of history Clinton

811
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,990
ramped our our spending down at two

812
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:29,669
point eight percent but on average we

813
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,640
still still spent three and a half

814
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:35,280
percent then 9/11 happened you know over

815
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,690
the the decade we spent about three

816
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,049
point nine percent an average Bush had

817
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,370
increases about four point five and last

818
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,379
year of Obama were back down to three

819
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,989
point two percent but again all

820
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,100
significantly higher than two percent so

821
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,500
the American taxpayer has been

822
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:53,040
supporting not only America's military

823
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,080
and to defend America but we are the

824
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,270
world's superpower we have been called

825
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,970
upon to in many respects provide

826
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:03,320
stability of the world and kind of all

827
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:08,040
we're asking is can countries in Europe

828
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,918
spend 2% so it's just a reality that if

829
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,590
that doesn't happen right the most

830
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,990
unpopular form of foreign of spending

831
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,790
and fit in in American in terms of the

832
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,070
federal government is foreign aid and

833
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,360
military spending to defend people that

834
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,000
aren't willing to spend money defend

835
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,379
themselves so when we've got troops

836
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,870
stationed in Europe and we know that

837
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,150
cost a lot of money at some point in

838
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:32,189
time the American public will not be

839
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:35,850
supporting the foreign aid they will not

840
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,890
support spending on military in places

841
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:39,570
outside the US and that would be a very

842
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,460
dangerous point for the world so people

843
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,549
need to understand this is really about

844
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,130
American public support and of course

845
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:49,379
Donald Trump ran as a candidate saying

846
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,750
exactly this and so he's pretty well

847
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,460
just following up on what his voters and

848
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,169
by the way probably far more than just

849
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,910
his voters as well this wasn't just

850
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:59,850
people supported President Trump I mean

851
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:01,140
foreign aid spending on military

852
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,939
defending other people that aren't

853
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,490
willing to spend money to defend

854
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,000
themselves is a highly unpopular thing

855
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,230
to do

856
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,650
don't you think part of the problem

857
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:12,900
though is that in the United States

858
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:15,660
voters tend to completely exaggerated

859
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,799
the amount that we spend Oh so did you

860
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,960
when you meet with constituents you

861
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,370
explain that to them I try to and and

862
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,170
did you feel as though that there's an

863
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,459
understanding there that's increasing or

864
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,860
not I hope so

865
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,990
okay but but again it's it's hard to

866
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,209
overcome a basic public perception that

867
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:34,230
half of our spending is you know

868
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:36,929
unforunately that 1% again it's why I

869
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:39,059
started the conversation again and I try

870
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:40,799
and convey this as much as I can a

871
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:43,770
thousand sons and daughters of our NATO

872
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,870
partners to pay that ultimate price okay

873
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,179
I want to start asking the audience to

874
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,409
start thinking about questions you want

875
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,059
to ask the center I'm going to ask them

876
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,140
one or two more myself but if you want

877
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,790
to start thinking about what you'd like

878
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,110
to to ask me have an unusual opportunity

879
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,240
to ask them who really knows what's

880
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,350
going on I do want to ask you one

881
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,059
question before we turn to the audience

882
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,490
what do you make of the appointment of

883
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:04,260
Bob Mueller is a special counsel to take

884
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,580
over the investigation of the potential

885
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,860
links between the Trump campaign and

886
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,750
Russia well first first of all a person

887
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,870
of high integrity probably couldn't get

888
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:14,910
a somebody that was going to be accepted

889
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,100
by both sides than been Robert Mueller

890
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:18,630
the problem is I think we need to get

891
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,428
the bottom of any kind of Russian

892
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:23,490
influence any kind of collusion we need

893
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:25,230
to get all the facts on the table I was

894
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,000
very supportive of Senate Intel

895
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,590
committee doing their work now I'm

896
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,480
chairman of the Homeland Security

897
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:33,990
government affairs the Senate Oversight

898
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,549
Committee I've yielded bad investigation

899
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,870
to the Senate Intel committee because

900
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:39,750
Laden's information should remain

901
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,040
classified by the way the only crime

902
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,299
that we know has been committed is the

903
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,230
leaking of classified information so I

904
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:47,879
my preference would have been to have

905
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,190
the Senate Intel committee complete its

906
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,049
job its investigation and issue report

907
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:55,040
so we can see if any further actually

908
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:57,720
need to be taken the problem with a

909
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,370
special counsel and a criminal

910
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,830
investigation which is what I'm assuming

911
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:03,959
that is because I've run up against us

912
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:06,178
in my oversight work is the minute you

913
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,679
have an investigation then people stop

914
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,850
talking you don't have access documents

915
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,070
so I think it's going to be that much

916
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,350
more difficult for Senate committees to

917
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:16,320
conduct their oversight work and let's

918
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:19,590
patience you know the history of special

919
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,990
counsels oral prosecute prosecutors is

920
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,720
that they just dragged on and

921
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:26,640
on and on and in such a dangerous world

922
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,720
with such enormous problems I don't

923
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,010
think we can afford to have the same

924
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,590
drag on I'd like to bring this to a

925
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,790
swift conclusion take whatever action we

926
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,360
need to take so we can move on and start

927
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:38,550
addressing those things so in the end I

928
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,040
said after our briefing with the Deputy

929
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,409
Assistant Deputy Attorney General is be

930
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,580
careful what you wish for Democrats were

931
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,800
calling for a special counsel other

932
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,090
people were they got it and I think

933
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,740
we're going to slow down the process

934
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,540
which is unfortunate you talked about

935
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:53,460
the leaking of intelligence were you

936
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,020
alarmed by the Times reports about

937
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,820
President Trump sharing of intelligence

938
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,840
with the Russians during his meeting

939
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,070
with them meeting during which

940
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,139
apparently according to The Times

941
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,250
referred to the former Director of the

942
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,120
FBI is a nut job

943
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:07,679
I'm concerned about all kinds of leaks

944
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,330
it's not good and you've got

945
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,679
intelligence professionals apparently

946
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:13,020
they're leaking these things they are no

947
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:14,700
better and it jeopardizes our national

948
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,139
security and it's wrong it should be

949
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,549
hopefully that we can find out who's

950
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,200
leaking and prosecute them so other

951
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:20,490
people won't do it the British were also

952
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,649
upset about this of course - about the

953
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:23,819
Manchester I mean listen if I if America

954
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,759
is providing intelligence know the

955
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,310
country and it leaks out and you risk

956
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,899
sources and methods you risk sources

957
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,239
you're risking people's lives yeah

958
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:36,210
people need to be upset I'm upset about

959
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:38,790
the leakers alright let's let's turn to

960
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,080
our audience and see what you'd like to

961
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,560
know let's start with this gentleman

962
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:46,319
over here please tell us who you are and

963
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,270
please ask a question and keep it short

964
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,639
thank you thank you very much

965
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:52,770
I'm Lazaro - former foreign minister of

966
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,280
Romania a doctor raised a question to

967
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:58,650
Senator Johnson yesterday in the first

968
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,410
panel when we are talking about the

969
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:09,540
global trends one aspect was pointed out

970
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:13,290
the fact that as of now 124 countries he

971
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:17,970
was a main commercial trade partner

972
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:24,600
China while the United States is at 60

973
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:30,290
yeah 56 how do you comment this trend

974
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:33,290
which seems to be increasing in terms of

975
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:35,080
free trade in terms of leadership in

976
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,540
shaping

977
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,490
the rules and the way how the

978
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,610
international trade is together to be

979
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:45,250
carried out well I think America has to

980
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:47,230
be fully engaged in just about every

981
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:49,510
market of the world so again that's

982
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,790
that's why I'm for free but we have to

983
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,100
insist on unfair trade and I think we

984
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:56,110
also need globally insist that China

985
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,020
understands and abides by the rules the

986
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:02,050
world as well you know respects

987
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,970
intellectual property cracks down on the

988
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:06,820
cyber attackers coming out of China

989
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,439
where you have that massive theft but

990
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,480
listen I think China's be incredibly

991
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,920
smart in terms of their investments all

992
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,110
over the world Americans should be

993
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,990
making those investments and we do with

994
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:20,650
China's doing them very strategically

995
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:22,959
I'm I have no idea truthfully may I do

996
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:24,970
but it's very unfortunate China's

997
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,070
military buildup whose really

998
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:30,910
threatening them now I don't understand

999
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:32,650
Russia's aggression so you know there

1000
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,569
are many trends in the world that are

1001
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,550
just disappointing and quite honestly

1002
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,620
baffling if you certainly take a look

1003
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,150
the the us's viewpoint of these things

1004
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,710
which we're trying to bring peace and

1005
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,300
stability in the world we've opened up

1006
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,000
our markets we've been very magnanimous

1007
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,320
I wish people would recognize that and

1008
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,420
work with us as cooperatively as

1009
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,220
possible respecting the rule of law

1010
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,860
respecting intellectual property rights

1011
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,799
I think and respecting trade deals not

1012
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,720
engaging in non-tariff barriers and

1013
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,830
other trade abuses but I want to follow

1014
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,649
up on that just for a second because you

1015
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:05,710
just got a bunch of time defending

1016
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:07,000
increases in US defense spending for all

1017
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,990
the same reasons wouldn't the Chinese

1018
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,240
say well of course we're going to

1019
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,100
increase ours is too how does it that

1020
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,859
wasn't any different so what what other

1021
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:17,529
power in world history is provided as

1022
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:19,840
many is sacrificed so much for others

1023
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,040
and again our NATO partners have done it

1024
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,920
as well it's a pretty extraordinary

1025
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,630
thing in the span of human history it's

1026
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,730
: Powell I think others have said this

1027
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,100
too is you know we send our sons sons

1028
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:33,220
and daughters you know to fight in

1029
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:35,170
battles to to preserve other people's

1030
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,819
freedom and we never do it for land the

1031
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,450
only land we asked for is enough to bury

1032
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,100
our dad

1033
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,470
that's pretty something pretty

1034
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:44,890
extraordinary u.s. and our NATO partners

1035
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:47,319
have done you can't say that about these

1036
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,700
you know some of these other powers so

1037
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,770
again you have to take a look at the

1038
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,279
world as it is I think America and

1039
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,960
obviously I'm biased but in a very

1040
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,000
dispassionate way America has been I

1041
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,670
think a phenomenal force for good and

1042
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,600
peace in the world some of the people

1043
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:09,860
haven't been yes the gentleman in the in

1044
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:12,259
the middle here in this row yes thank

1045
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:14,180
you please tell us who you are and

1046
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,370
please keep your question short sure

1047
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,649
Julia Faludi from Afghanistan thank you

1048
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,390
I this this is a good opportunity early

1049
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,520
I wanted to thank the NATO partners and

1050
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,620
your great nations for the sacrifice did

1051
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,420
in Afghanistan and we are so grateful

1052
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,950
though the mission in NATO is definitely

1053
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,930
complicated and failed we need to in

1054
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,490
fact to check about a test and

1055
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,520
definitely we are looking forward to get

1056
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:37,609
a result but about you sir um there are

1057
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,410
a lot of comments about your commitment

1058
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:42,590
in Wisconsin and also about your

1059
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:44,480
comments about the veterans me coming

1060
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:46,670
from Afghanistan we've got economic

1061
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,770
motivated enemies and ideological

1062
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,480
motivated one the economic motivating

1063
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,880
one are getting supportive at the NATO

1064
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,200
partners with the European with all with

1065
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,940
your great nations that at least we

1066
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,589
create them jobs that at least they

1067
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,630
would not join the terrorist group and

1068
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:01,610
feed them in their families but the

1069
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,650
ideological motivated ones are supported

1070
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,420
by the external elements from different

1071
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,640
countries I don't want to name earlier I

1072
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,280
named in fact they are well known by the

1073
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,720
world community so you're talking about

1074
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,140
which ones you're talking about

1075
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:17,299
supporting your your troops and also

1076
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,279
your weapons when there's this quick fix

1077
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,110
solution that you would stop in fact

1078
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,480
those sources in fact do not feed the

1079
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:25,700
ideological motivated one then why don't

1080
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,440
you that you make sure in fact the talk

1081
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,089
with the NATO partners or the Europeans

1082
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,100
or with the other Middle Eastern

1083
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:33,050
countries that they are directly

1084
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,180
involved feeding in fact those groups

1085
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:37,610
did you make sure to talk about that's a

1086
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:39,560
big fix and quick fix for the troops

1087
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,600
they're not sacrifi more yeah I would

1088
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,180
recommend that people read President

1089
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,529
Trump speech in Saudi Arabia they you'd

1090
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,850
be hard-pressed to disagree with what

1091
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,220
he's saying I think that's exactly what

1092
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,600
rying to accomplish is get a global

1093
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,879
Coalition of the Willing certainly of

1094
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:56,060
the Arab states to cut off funding to

1095
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,829
renounce and reject this radicalization

1096
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,279
of

1097
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:02,190
of you know this extreme ideology is

1098
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:05,489
extremely important you know my first

1099
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:08,589
trip as a senator was to Afghanistan to

1100
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:11,140
Kuwait Pakistan in Afghanistan and I

1101
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:12,430
will never forget we visited the

1102
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,839
training mission there and we had our

1103
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,819
own interpreters and I was able to talk

1104
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,849
to people who are signing up and being

1105
00:40:15,819 --> 00:40:19,959
trained for the Afghanistan military and

1106
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:21,400
you know I would always ask you because

1107
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,959
we were told well they're joining

1108
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,569
because they're being taught how to read

1109
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:27,729
and you know so I was asking the people

1110
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:29,140
that I was talking to you know why do

1111
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:30,879
you join the military you know why are

1112
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,140
you joining this effort and probably the

1113
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,630
last person I talked to had the most

1114
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:37,900
eloquent answer it's very simply said

1115
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:40,359
for my country we want peace if we

1116
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,969
concentrate and I'm come from business

1117
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:44,410
world you know I didn't sit down and

1118
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:45,390
negotiating tables start arguing off all

1119
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,348
the time

1120
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:49,029
negotiating technique was laying out all

1121
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:52,959
the areas of agreement if we would

1122
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:55,450
concentrate as humanity on areas of

1123
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:57,160
agreement let's face it the vast the

1124
00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:00,009
vast majority of human beings on this

1125
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,410
planet just want to live a life they

1126
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:04,569
want peace they want security they want

1127
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:06,578
safety they want to be able to raise

1128
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:08,079
their children to hopefully have a

1129
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:10,719
better life than themselves they want

1130
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,690
opportunity they want prosperity if we

1131
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:16,269
concentrate on that and again as

1132
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:20,109
citizens of the world we work together

1133
00:41:16,269 --> 00:41:21,249
to achieve that you know that's probably

1134
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:22,989
the best place to start

1135
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:24,988
you know don't delve right into the

1136
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:27,579
differences concentrate and why we're

1137
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:30,309
you know involved in these types of

1138
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:31,839
alliances I'm interested in follow-up

1139
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:33,999
and his question is that are the are the

1140
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,049
Saudis and I think we're referring very

1141
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:36,279
much satti Reddy and you brought the

1142
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:37,959
speech of the saudis playing a

1143
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:40,109
constructive role in countering violent

1144
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:42,910
extremism I hope so

1145
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:46,209
welcome right again I hope side are that

1146
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:48,609
I'm I I believe they will be now I think

1147
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:50,140
there's certainly elements today within

1148
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:52,749
Saudi Arabia that have been funding

1149
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:56,259
these things in the past I mean it's

1150
00:41:52,749 --> 00:41:59,229
it's a very complicated web but you know

1151
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:01,779
I'm hoping that this is kind of a start

1152
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:03,160
of a new beginning we it was not good

1153
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:06,009
under the Obama administration in terms

1154
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,399
of who we were supporting and who we

1155
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:10,380
weren't and so now I think it's

1156
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,609
the Trump administration is bringing

1157
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,619
some real clarity in terms of who our

1158
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:16,170
friends are who the real enemies to

1159
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,049
peace are and let's talk about Iran I

1160
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,339
mean it is Iran that is widely

1161
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:23,099
recognizes the greatest state-sponsored

1162
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:24,450
terrorism in the world and I think it

1163
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,740
was so destructive about the Iranian

1164
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,720
agreement I know European partners

1165
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,879
engaged in that and agreed to it as well

1166
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,399
I think it was a disastrous deal then

1167
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,960
why we have final we have funneled you

1168
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,499
know hunter at least a hundred billion

1169
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:40,049
dollars into the economy and military of

1170
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:41,669
our self-proclaimed enemy we have not

1171
00:42:40,049 --> 00:42:42,299
denied them the ability to become a

1172
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,210
nuclear power

1173
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:47,880
you know their behavior yeah it modified

1174
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,650
not for the better for the worse so we

1175
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,240
need to recognize that reality they are

1176
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,650
the greatest threat and we need to

1177
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,089
resist that threat and the metal

1178
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:56,519
resistor was strengthened resolved the

1179
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:58,109
better alternative was resistant was

1180
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:59,519
strengthened resolved the only reason

1181
00:42:58,109 --> 00:43:01,788
they came to the negotiating tables

1182
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,828
because sanctions were having effect and

1183
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:06,269
what I always found offensive is when

1184
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:08,940
the Obon administration would talk about

1185
00:43:06,269 --> 00:43:11,519
snapback sanctions how do you snapback

1186
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,259
100 billion dollars under their economy

1187
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,359
military how do you snapback all the

1188
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:15,989
commercial deals have been done that was

1189
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,058
a fantasy

1190
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:20,549
it was just inaccurate it was it was

1191
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:23,579
false and so we are we are there on a

1192
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:25,769
path we only possibly delayed their

1193
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:27,480
becoming nuclear power they continued to

1194
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:31,258
test ballistic missiles they continue to

1195
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:33,420
engage in all kinds of provocative

1196
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:35,489
behavior it's not good which is why

1197
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,720
we've got to strengthen our alliances

1198
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:40,140
and relationships with the Gulf states

1199
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,169
the the Sunni Arabs and with Israel next

1200
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:45,710
question yes the gem in the front row

1201
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,710
here go time

1202
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:53,700
yes constantly negative on Moscow

1203
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:57,270
actually skew from what few said senator

1204
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:59,399
about Iran during the election campaign

1205
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:01,380
I understand what rhetoric could be

1206
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,020
slightly different from reality but

1207
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,200
there was very strong rhetoric about you

1208
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:09,540
know reversing the Iran deal and

1209
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,520
adopting a new policy doesn't look like

1210
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,740
the Iran policy has happened in

1211
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,900
Washington what do you think will be the

1212
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,959
steps of the Trump administration with

1213
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:22,290
regard to Iran practical steps and

1214
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,480
secondly how does Russia fits into that

1215
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:28,110
because how does Russia fit into that

1216
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,780
because it's an ally of Iran and might

1217
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,310
react if the u.s. tries to brush Tehran

1218
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,510
thank you very much actually I also

1219
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,790
happen to think that the deal was a

1220
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:37,230
disaster well so first of all campaign

1221
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,850
rhetoric is just that its campaign

1222
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,080
rhetoric and then you get into Austin

1223
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:43,529
you have to face reality and the reality

1224
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:46,340
is the deal is done that the money's you

1225
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:49,500
know is injecting their economy military

1226
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,090
the commercial deals are struck so so

1227
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,940
there is no really tearing up the deal

1228
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:55,880
it's already completed what you saw to

1229
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,740
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee

1230
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:04,680
markup last week was additional

1231
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:06,870
sanctions so I will continue to do what

1232
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,879
we need to do to try and push back on

1233
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,170
Iran but the cats out of the bag I mean

1234
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,670
we're going to we're in a far more

1235
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:13,860
difficult position with Iran than we

1236
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:14,940
were prior to that deal but I think

1237
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,160
you'll see greater strength to resolve

1238
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,530
you'll see the strength of the

1239
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,690
relationship but try and have the the

1240
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:23,580
Sunni Arab states be as a counterbalance

1241
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,860
we need to solve the the Syrian

1242
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,200
situation if we can stabilize the events

1243
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,030
in Syria try and push Iranian influence

1244
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,980
out of there that would be a plus so we

1245
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:36,090
just got to be continue to push back on

1246
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:38,190
Iran and quite honestly try and support

1247
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:41,100
those elements within Iran that are

1248
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:43,490
trying to provide greater democracy you

1249
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:46,920
know a more liberalization of the

1250
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,810
Iranian government it's it's a real

1251
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,050
shame the start of my administration

1252
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:55,049
there was not even vocal support when

1253
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:57,870
the students basically protested against

1254
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,470
a rigged election and that Senate very

1255
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:02,098
again that sent a very bad signal and

1256
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,720
strengthen the

1257
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,650
those hands in Iran which is not helpful

1258
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:09,660
but of course the hardliners in Iran

1259
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:11,579
oppose the nuclear deal and it was the

1260
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,140
moderates who supported it so in other

1261
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:14,609
are there other really moderates and the

1262
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,089
Iranian government you think so I don't

1263
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,799
think so

1264
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:18,779
are they real I will call them moderates

1265
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:21,119
but they're not moderates so no

1266
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:23,069
difference it makes no difference

1267
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,229
Artur hardliners but there are no the

1268
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:26,400
people in power are not moderates what

1269
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:28,828
about this question about Iran because

1270
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,569
it's an interesting point how do you how

1271
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,829
is there anything that Washington can do

1272
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:33,269
and especially now that there's been a

1273
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:34,739
sort of idea that we should improve

1274
00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:37,439
relationship with Russia in some way is

1275
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:39,599
there anything that Washington can do to

1276
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,789
try to drive a wedge between Moscow and

1277
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,200
Tehran well again I think it's the

1278
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:45,269
strength our alliance with the Sunni

1279
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,839
Arab states and Israel don't weaken

1280
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:50,098
Israel one of the things I've asked

1281
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:53,279
European delegations let's face it

1282
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:55,859
European delegations that you know voted

1283
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:59,190
to poke a stick in Israel's eye with

1284
00:46:55,859 --> 00:47:00,960
that the resolution on settlements if

1285
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,660
you had to move your family to the

1286
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,910
Middle East for a couple of years what

1287
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:08,339
country would you move them to I think

1288
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:10,589
it's pretty obvious if you're a Syrian

1289
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:12,210
would you rather be an Aleppo or would

1290
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:15,479
you rather be in the Golan Heights being

1291
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:18,210
you know under the governance of Israeli

1292
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:20,968
law let's look at the reality situation

1293
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,680
I think Israel is a stabilizing force in

1294
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:25,229
the Middle East we should support them

1295
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,690
we should help strengthen our friends we

1296
00:47:25,229 --> 00:47:29,549
should weaken our enemies and the policy

1297
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:32,069
of the last administration and the

1298
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:34,049
Iranian greement strengthened again are

1299
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:35,759
the hand of our enemies and really

1300
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:37,288
weaken the position of our friends may

1301
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:38,670
we got to reverse that course and that's

1302
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:44,660
course what the Trump administration is

1303
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:44,660
going to do yes sir a question over here

1304
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,690
thank you very much and we haven't

1305
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,400
spoken about brexit yet and don't see

1306
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:52,739
the UK u.s. sorry i'm jonathan Aitken

1307
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,269
british influence think-tank and the UK

1308
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:56,789
US relation relationship is very

1309
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:58,379
important in Britain President Trump was

1310
00:47:56,789 --> 00:48:00,210
initially very very enthusiastic about

1311
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,640
brexit but may have so tempered some of

1312
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:05,039
his language since then and also there

1313
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,839
may be some confusion about where the

1314
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,789
trade with the EU is more important than

1315
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:11,239
trade with the UK going forward so I

1316
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:13,559
mean do you see that you use a more

1317
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:15,450
important partner for the US and the UK

1318
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:16,000
going forward and watching the prospects

1319
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:17,890
are for

1320
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,930
free-trade agreement with both first a

1321
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:22,330
little TTIP and with the UK and what

1322
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:24,069
might the price be the u.s. demands for

1323
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:25,600
a free trade agreement with the UK that

1324
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:27,790
the UK government is very very keen to

1325
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,259
proceed with thank you well first of all

1326
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:31,420
I think they're both incredibly

1327
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,880
important partners and I want to engage

1328
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,670
in free and open and fair trade with the

1329
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:40,210
you know the UK as well as Europe

1330
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:42,010
just on a personal basis when I you know

1331
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:44,080
I don't like bureaucracy I'm not a real

1332
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,610
fan of the US federal government we've

1333
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,520
gone way outside the enumerated powers

1334
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:49,660
the Constitution it's not helpful you

1335
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,830
take a look at some of the problems the

1336
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,750
federal government's trying to solve

1337
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:55,960
they just make them worse and my guess

1338
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:58,450
is not being a you know that engaged in

1339
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,640
European Union but my sense is you've

1340
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:02,770
got that enormous bureaucracy that just

1341
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,029
continues to grow and by the way quick

1342
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:06,040
little insight for people for the

1343
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,380
business world what I have certainly

1344
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,940
come to realize is the motivation of

1345
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,410
government I don't care what government

1346
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,570
you know whether it's Brussels or

1347
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:15,160
whether it's Washington DC is the exact

1348
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:19,180
same motivations of private sector wants

1349
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,290
to grow and often you know in the

1350
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,970
private sector in order to grow you

1351
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,560
actually have to succeed you have to

1352
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:25,149
produce a product or service that you

1353
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,120
can produce at a cost list you can sell

1354
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,830
it for you provide value to economies

1355
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,870
government let's face it Val your

1356
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:34,210
failure allows you to grow in America

1357
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:36,850
we've engaged in a multi-decade war on

1358
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:38,410
poverty we having to move the needle you

1359
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:39,880
can say a lot of our metrics are

1360
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,470
actually worse having spent thirteen to

1361
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,190
twenty two trillion dollars which is

1362
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:47,830
about how much debt we're in so when I

1363
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,360
when I saw the results of the brexit

1364
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:52,090
vote I'm just saying on a personal basis

1365
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,890
I thought yeah blow for freedom but then

1366
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:56,320
you start recognizing reality this is

1367
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:59,379
very complex so I don't know that's good

1368
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:02,880
or bad I'm hoping that all parties are

1369
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:05,530
very level-headed and that whatever the

1370
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,420
the divorce proceedings or divorce

1371
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:10,210
settlement is going to be on brexit I

1372
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,680
hope it's to everybody's benefit but

1373
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:14,020
from my standpoint the US needs to

1374
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,750
engage with the UK as well as Europe is

1375
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:21,040
as openly as in you know

1376
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:22,780
robust fashion as possible it we are the

1377
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,580
bulwark of freedom and stability and

1378
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,050
peace in the world we just aren't we

1379
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:28,720
have to recognize that that's what's so

1380
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:29,619
important about NATO about our alliances

1381
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,509
within

1382
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:34,170
you know Europe and you know between

1383
00:50:31,509 --> 00:50:37,480
that in the United States

1384
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:39,339
next question yes the the gentleman in

1385
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:43,569
the back with wearing glasses is

1386
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:46,210
eyeglasses yes the general of the

1387
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:47,950
eyeglasses thank you oh I'm sorry I'm

1388
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,210
sorry I meant I meant the fellow next to

1389
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:51,220
you I will give why don't you ask the

1390
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:52,839
question I'll go to him now sorry thank

1391
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:55,058
you Chris Walker at the National

1392
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:58,480
Endowment for democracy in Washington

1393
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:59,799
senator you indicated earlier that we

1394
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,390
should be concerned and you asked

1395
00:50:59,799 --> 00:51:03,519
question of why it is Russia and China

1396
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:05,999
are deepening their investments in their

1397
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:09,549
military another aspect to this is

1398
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:12,160
massive investments in non-military

1399
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:14,799
kinetic forms of influence so Russia has

1400
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,180
invested in its aarti efforts Sputnik

1401
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:18,788
China to votes

1402
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:21,129
billions of dollars to its international

1403
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:25,509
media platforms how would you assess the

1404
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:28,029
US and European response to this global

1405
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:29,380
media influence effort that's been

1406
00:51:28,029 --> 00:51:32,170
undertaken by these authoritarian

1407
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,670
regimes way too weak now it is

1408
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,259
interesting having come over to on a

1409
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:37,450
number of bipartisan congressional

1410
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:39,940
delegations into Ukraine or Eastern

1411
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:42,450
Europe you know those that haven't been

1412
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:46,509
over to Eastern Europe very often

1413
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:47,980
they're shocked by the reports of the

1414
00:51:46,509 --> 00:51:50,739
propaganda the misinformation

1415
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,170
disinformation campaigns that that's why

1416
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:54,519
you know Russia's meddling in our US

1417
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,690
election didn't surprise me in the

1418
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:57,038
slightest I mean they've been doing it

1419
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,749
in Eastern Europe they've been trying it

1420
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,789
in the u.s. probably for decades as well

1421
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:03,430
they just have a new tool called the

1422
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:05,230
Internet so know we've got to do a far

1423
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,089
more effective job of pushing back

1424
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,859
countering their propaganda this

1425
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:10,859
disinformation we felt a couple hearings

1426
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:13,410
on this and in my European subcommittee

1427
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:16,630
one of the conclusions of the hearing is

1428
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:19,450
not that they're trying to convince the

1429
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:22,809
public you know the world audience that

1430
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:24,489
their system is better or what they're

1431
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:26,259
saying is true they realize they really

1432
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:28,180
can't do that what they're really trying

1433
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:30,190
to do is just so the disinformation to

1434
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,919
get people to think you can't believe

1435
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:35,589
anybody you know and they're doing a

1436
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,789
pretty effective job I mean they've just

1437
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:39,460
got to be you know way more than

1438
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:41,529
chuckling as we're stepping all over

1439
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,150
ourselves based on you know what if you

1440
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:44,950
know what meddling they didn't in

1441
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,800
u.s. election and how it's tying up

1442
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:49,960
let's hope not tying up Washington knots

1443
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:53,050
but it certainly had a very harmful

1444
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:56,140
effect so we need to recognize who they

1445
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:57,790
are we need to push back but we need to

1446
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,160
use things like you know there's Radio

1447
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:03,610
Free Europe Voice of America I'd love to

1448
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:06,220
see a much more robust in a coordinated

1449
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:08,920
effort by Europe Eastern Europe pushing

1450
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:10,649
back against RT because it's very

1451
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:14,020
effective it's it's entertainment it's

1452
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:15,790
propaganda of you know disguised as

1453
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:18,100
entertainment probably the most

1454
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:19,630
effective propaganda you can have so we

1455
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,569
got to recognize how effective it is we

1456
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:24,450
have to push back and counter it ok and

1457
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:29,130
now to the gentleman who was waiting

1458
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:32,410
thank you cristela very much sukhiya

1459
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:34,810
president president president of China

1460
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:37,330
Institute of International Studies a

1461
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:41,560
think tank under the foreign ministry

1462
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:44,650
probably is a good place for for us to

1463
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:47,799
say a few words that is well sometimes

1464
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:53,800
when China the name is mentioned by West

1465
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:57,130
media and Charlie is cast not in some

1466
00:53:53,800 --> 00:54:00,010
good fashion just now we heard that the

1467
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:02,740
channel was associated with the theft on

1468
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:04,810
the internet and also there people are

1469
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,970
concerned with a military buildup so

1470
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:09,100
what I would like to say is that when

1471
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:12,160
you look at the channel foreign policy

1472
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:14,740
emphasis we are actually just like

1473
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,710
sanitary you have just now said we are

1474
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:21,129
Pro internationalization coup

1475
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:23,530
polarization of the economy and we are

1476
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:25,750
for interconnectivity so we are for

1477
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:28,900
peace and development that means that my

1478
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:31,780
question is for you senator this and

1479
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:35,830
just now you mentioned that you are for

1480
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:40,060
free trade and you are a member of the

1481
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:44,980
Republican Party and in the US political

1482
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:47,400
operators your views how do you regard

1483
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:50,520
your views in terms of the

1484
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:54,610
administration and other members of the

1485
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,150
Parliament are you views regarded as a

1486
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:59,839
minority view

1487
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:02,029
majority thank you very much let me go

1488
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:07,069
to public opinion I think was because I

1489
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:09,289
am for free trade but fair trade polling

1490
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:11,869
results for example we had a exit poll

1491
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:13,819
in our Wisconsin primary there were more

1492
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:16,250
Republicans that thought free trade cost

1493
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:17,960
American workers jobs then created it

1494
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,520
which i think is just an incorrect

1495
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,329
notion but that's that's where public

1496
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,589
opinion is and so from my standpoint

1497
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:27,349
those that are engaged in free trade

1498
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:29,150
have got to do a far better job talking

1499
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:31,270
about the facts the reality that it

1500
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:35,000
really is good for us I mean after his

1501
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:37,220
benefited Canada America and Mexico and

1502
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,779
that's a good thing you do want a rising

1503
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,259
tide lifting all boats and it's just

1504
00:55:38,779 --> 00:55:43,430
true

1505
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:44,750
so hopefully and certainly this has been

1506
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,069
my discussions with members

1507
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,630
administration that are engaged in this

1508
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:50,329
whether it's a Commerce Secretary Ross

1509
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:52,760
or the other members involved in the

1510
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:57,619
trade negotiations is yeah go ahead and

1511
00:55:52,760 --> 00:56:00,260
target and try and solve the or end the

1512
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:02,059
trade abuses by our trading partners but

1513
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:06,109
boy don't engage in protectionism we

1514
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:09,500
need to keep all markets open to free

1515
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:11,750
and fair trade ok we have time for one

1516
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,920
more audience question and we'll go to

1517
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:17,539
this gentleman with the red tie

1518
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,700
Thank You Matthew Rhodes from the George

1519
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:24,740
C Marshall Center and University of

1520
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:27,259
Wisconsin 1997 go Badgers in the current

1521
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,149
issue of the Atlantic Monthly secretary

1522
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,279
mattis names the lack of political unity

1523
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,770
in the United States as one of his

1524
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:35,089
biggest security concerns I'd be

1525
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:37,400
interested in your thoughts on that

1526
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:39,470
issue and the challenges you see in

1527
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:43,190
dealing with that within Congress and

1528
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:45,410
with voters you know I think I mean the

1529
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:48,770
the massive protests that occurred the

1530
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:50,649
Saturday after the inauguration that was

1531
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:53,750
depressing

1532
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,369
yeah I bet on both sides of the the in

1533
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:57,799
terms of presidential elections losing

1534
00:56:55,369 --> 00:56:59,119
signed the winning side I certainly want

1535
00:56:57,799 --> 00:57:02,150
to do everything I could to help

1536
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,369
President Obama succeed at those shared

1537
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:07,250
goals of keeping America safe prosperous

1538
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:09,090
and secure there does seem to have been

1539
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:12,120
a concerted effort on you know

1540
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:13,890
from across the board a Aleph eart to

1541
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,500
sabotage this administration which is

1542
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:18,150
not good you can be opposed to policies

1543
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,700
that's fine but you know taking the

1544
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:21,360
streets the day after election is not

1545
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:24,089
helpful

1546
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:26,820
so I share secretary Madison's concern

1547
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:29,520
that way providing some comfort I'll go

1548
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:32,850
back to the unanimous result in terms of

1549
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:35,250
this is just one small example the

1550
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:36,960
events in Ukraine I think reality I

1551
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:39,240
think providing proper information I

1552
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,610
think if you would be involved in for

1553
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:44,669
example our business meetings or or for

1554
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:46,560
our committee meetings for the Senate

1555
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:50,040
Committee on Foreign Relations you will

1556
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:52,220
see an awful lot of agreement certainly

1557
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:56,279
from my standpoint I always like the

1558
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:58,890
concept that politics ends at the you

1559
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,750
know the the shores edge I don't think

1560
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:02,549
it's ever necessarily been true but it's

1561
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:04,740
certainly an ideal that we should aspire

1562
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:06,170
to and I think we're probably closer

1563
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:09,660
that when it comes to foreign policy

1564
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:13,350
then sometimes you see on the domestic

1565
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:14,790
side of politics I'm surprised to hear

1566
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,319
you say that it was depressing to you

1567
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,000
when people came out on the streets that

1568
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,190
those were those were peaceful protests

1569
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,270
it's surely isn't that the hallmark of a

1570
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:27,210
healthy democracy yes but the day after

1571
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:29,430
an election - is there a better time to

1572
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,840
throw it - throw it well yeah I mean

1573
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:33,029
come out prior to the election win the

1574
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,120
election and then accept the results and

1575
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:38,250
give a new president a chance to govern

1576
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,690
without setting up immediately the

1577
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:41,400
resistance I mean there you know yes

1578
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:44,100
those are peaceful protests there's an

1579
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,730
awful lot of vile things said a lot of

1580
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:49,710
pretty vile placards and posters as well

1581
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:51,090
so well some of the responses were just

1582
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:52,260
some fairly violent things that were

1583
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:54,540
said by the person who won the election

1584
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,610
so anyway you know from my standpoint

1585
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,590
I'm looking for a little comedy in our

1586
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:00,270
in our politics I'm trying to

1587
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:02,670
concentrate on the areas agreement we do

1588
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:04,340
let's face it as a world community in

1589
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:06,960
the United States we have enormous

1590
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,670
challenges if we concentrating those

1591
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,150
areas agreement that shared purpose of

1592
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:14,490
you know peace security prosperity we're

1593
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:17,130
in a whole lot better spot then again

1594
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:18,569
starting that negotiation protesting and

1595
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:21,130
concentrate on the areas of disagreement

1596
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:22,779
so again I you know fine yeah

1597
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,930
their political disagreements but let's

1598
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:27,400
concentrate on the areas of agreement

1599
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:29,169
let's tackle these enormous challenges

1600
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,160
fair enough I think that's a good place

1601
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:32,859
to good note to end on

1602
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,480
I agree ladies and gentlemen of lunch is

1603
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:35,650
