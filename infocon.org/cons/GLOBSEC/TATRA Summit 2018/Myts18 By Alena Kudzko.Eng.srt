1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,220
it's very optimistic and a bit I'm the

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,430
shrivel it's about the weather or about

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:19,070
the discussion I hope both the

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,410
everybody isn't a very positive mode of

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,730
thinking which is if I contrast it to

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,410
the past year it's a very dramatic

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,200
change because last year everybody was

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,180
in this various sober pessimistic mode

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,860
versus this year there is much more hope

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,140
about the future this is not to say that

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,170
we totally ignore the problems and chill

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,760
issues on the ground quite the opposite

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,590
people were able to look at the problems

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,269
with a very constructive approach and

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,580
find some solutions to the issue so I

16
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,530
hope on Monday everybody's gonna start

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,390
implementing they all the solutions that

18
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,390
we came up with during the Tatra summits
