1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,719
thank you again very much Prime Minister

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,010
for your speech and your warm welcome in

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,070
this beautiful setting and for hosting

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,480
us now I'm it says here introduce the

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,710
Commissioner but I'm pretty sure I don't

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,550
need to do that everyone in the room

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,369
knows who you are

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,619
and what this panel is going to be about

9
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,600
is EU entrepreneurial ecosystem and

10
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:31,570
whether it's creating or curbing

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,520
competition now as any good Czech

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,559
journalist does yesterday I decided to

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,230
crowdsource my questions to you today so

14
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,330
I went on Twitter and I asked the world

15
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,559
what they wanted me to ask you today and

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,210
you would think I would get some

17
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,760
terrible suggestions but actually I got

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,050
some very sensible questions and you

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,879
know the main thing that people are

20
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,409
asking is what is the future of

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,150
competition what does good competition

22
00:00:50,409 --> 00:01:00,159
look like to you well good competition

23
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:04,449
is what is serving customers well that

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:07,380
we can enjoy affordable prices Joyce

25
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:10,539
among different qualities but also

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,649
innovation because competition is a

27
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:16,810
great driver of innovation and both when

28
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:20,320
we as citizen are there in the role as

29
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:23,520
consumers but also I think as citizen in

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,139
this continent and within our union

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,479
competition will serve as well because

32
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:32,050
Europe obviously needs to stay in the

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,680
absolute high end of the value chain and

34
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,960
if we are to do that well then we need

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,530
to keep innovating and in that

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,080
competition is a very good thing also

37
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,730
because I think it's important that if

38
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,110
you want to innovate especially if

39
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,990
you're a small business or a

40
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,990
medium-sized business then you need to

41
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,169
be able to trust the marketplace that

42
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,640
you have a fair chance of making it

43
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,909
because if you find that the bigger guys

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,620
they are above the law that they can do

45
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:07,840
whatever then how to find the courage to

46
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,989
invest yourself your resources your

47
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,450
knowledge into producing something new

48
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:14,800
what do you say innovation and it might

49
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,899
sound very cynical but we here in

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,420
Brussels all the time this phrase don't

51
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,340
stifle innovation and often you know

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,720
when I hear that what I hear is oh just

53
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,390
let us do whatever we want and make

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,430
money I mean that breeds a sort of

55
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,820
atmosphere of distrust for companies

56
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:36,760
does it not well I think that Europe has

57
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:40,900
has shown how a European approach has

58
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,840
made us all very rich it's a very

59
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,240
prosperous continent just look at at our

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,110
host country today since that you

61
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,620
membership

62
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:53,920
I think the gap from being about 50% of

63
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,500
you average next year it will be just

64
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,208
slightly over 80% and I think of the 12

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,140
countries in the in the Union that would

66
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:07,390
grow the most the next year the visa

67
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,309
crack countries obviously among them but

68
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,279
so are all the countries that has come

69
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,110
into the Union most recently so this

70
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,760
european way of doing things where there

71
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:20,080
is a very good and close relationship

72
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,120
between competition and regulation that

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,100
creates on the one hand side the trust

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,550
but on the other hand side also the

75
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:30,100
drive well we hear a lot obviously the

76
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,720
big cases that are you know always in

77
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,980
the headlines are those big tech

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,950
companies and they are predominantly

79
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,119
american and you've been sick to death

80
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,410
i'm sure of being accused of being

81
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,420
anti-american but can you at least

82
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,690
address that because it comes up again

83
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:47,649
and again yes and I take that very

84
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:50,650
seriously because it's a it's one of the

85
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:54,190
sort of the very fundamentals of our

86
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,769
Union Union that we that we put equal

87
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:00,519
treatment into real life it's not a

88
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,739
theory it's not just in our textbook but

89
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,500
equal treatment no matter what flag

90
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,330
you're flying as a company if you're a

91
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,290
newcomer to the Union or you're a

92
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:13,870
founding member if you have opt outs

93
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,880
like my own home country if you are a

94
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,899
small country a big country if your

95
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:23,080
private appropriately owned so I always

96
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:27,640
take that very seriously and if you then

97
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:30,400
go through our work you'd find that that

98
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,320
it's it's not being a US company or a

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,929
European company of course we enforce

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,260
much more with European companies

101
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,880
lately also you know we have a big case

102
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,460
with gastro where we have imposed

103
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,450
binding commitments to allow prices to

104
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:50,260
come down so we I think we can fend for

105
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:54,880
ourselves the thing is more that since

106
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:57,520
we're in a technological digital

107
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,909
revolution and I don't think we have

108
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,460
seen it all these first decade made just

109
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,580
pieces of the dress rehearsal for

110
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,430
quantum computing and blockchain as the

111
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,349
Prime Minister just mentioned it there

112
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,260
will be more and since these are

113
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:17,110
formative years of course the companies

114
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,810
who are the first to harvest Network

115
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,810
effects marginal costs approaching shell

116
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,480
of course then we said a focus on what

117
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,780
they're doing because we are now forming

118
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,060
our societies to be digital well before

119
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,340
we sort of dive into specific cases and

120
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,160
let me ask you about the question of

121
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,229
size because the cases that you end up

122
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,060
taking on tend to be around issues of

123
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,360
dominance which by nature means they're

124
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,100
large but you know SMEs make up 99% of

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,170
the EU economy so where does competition

126
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,830
play a role when you're thinking of that

127
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:54,130
sector well let me offer two

128
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,740
perspectives one is of course that if

129
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,260
you're a smaller business in a national

130
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,650
market the national competition

131
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:06,219
authority will make sure that you that

132
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:10,840
you're not faced with competitors who

133
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,760
for instance catalyze or have decided to

134
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,500
do things that they shouldn't in

135
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,050
misusing maybe a national dominant

136
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,240
position and I think this is very

137
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,250
important and sometimes I wonder if this

138
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,760
model could not be used in other areas

139
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,710
well well we have a strong competence

140
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,170
within the Commission but we were

141
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,030
completely integrated with our national

142
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,390
competition authorities who actually

143
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,460
enforce the same legislation but to do

144
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,979
that on ground to make sure that

145
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,169
consumers in retail in construction in

146
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,000
some of the national markets are well

147
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,890
protected

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,529
second thing is that if you look at the

149
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,839
European business structure of course

150
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:51,399
we have gigantic companies but we also

151
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,859
have a lot of companies who are

152
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:55,659
completely dependent on the network of

153
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:58,479
small and medium-sized businesses and

154
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:01,359
that gives both a stability and the

155
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,779
flexibility that is unheard of

156
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:07,628
in economic zones where you are

157
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:10,299
dominated by giant businesses so it's

158
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:13,809
not just for sort of the festival

159
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:16,209
occasions it is for real that the medium

160
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:18,429
and small sized businesses they create

161
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:21,129
the jobs they take the young people on

162
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:25,179
board for apprentices they pay their

163
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:27,909
taxes so obviously for us it is

164
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:30,279
important to keep the market open for

165
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:33,039
them to do their business because they

166
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,899
are an enormous contributor probably one

167
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,479
of the most important our two European

168
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:39,429
prosperity well the other area now I

169
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,229
want to get on to is it's very tech

170
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:42,938
heavy which is my bread and butter so

171
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,649
I'm very happy about that and you've

172
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:47,649
talked a bit about the idea of data as a

173
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,999
commodity and sort of lay out how that

174
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:51,249
would work because you know even

175
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:53,409
relatively small in terms of employee

176
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:55,209
companies might be processing at an

177
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,649
absolutely enormous amount of data and

178
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,449
you get into an awful lot of issues

179
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:01,479
there around fundamental rights as well

180
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:03,729
as competition and consumer issues yeah

181
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:07,149
but you know very close to home when we

182
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:10,179
do a a merger procedure we would look

183
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:12,729
into what role will data play here maybe

184
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:14,529
it's nothing because the dates have the

185
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,049
two businesses merge is something that

186
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:18,719
you can easily copy or you can buy it or

187
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:22,299
you can create it yourself the next day

188
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:27,248
but maybe they merge sets of data that

189
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:29,859
will work as as a unique source for

190
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:33,069
innovation and a barrier to entry for

191
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:35,169
other businesses in this market and that

192
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:37,478
could give us a concern where the first

193
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,848
situation will give us no concern then

194
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,209
the last situation may give us concern

195
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:46,269
and this is why we analyze in depth what

196
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:49,319
role will data play as a resource as an

197
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:52,029
asset for businesses when they emerge

198
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:55,870
and then of course we keep an eye open

199
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:58,389
as to if if privacy can become a

200
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,819
competition issue I think we still have

201
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:03,279
some way to go because the new stronger

202
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:06,878
rules and and rights that we have are

203
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,889
still new in the making but what one

204
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,199
cannot exclude that it will also be an

205
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:13,689
area of competition because you can

206
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:16,029
expect services that will compete on the

207
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:18,279
quality of the protection that they can

208
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:21,309
give you as a citizen or as another

209
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,869
business I mean the logical extension of

210
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:24,969
that would be that companies that have

211
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:26,919
amassed too much data and are in

212
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,609
positions of ridiculous dominance which

213
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,869
we can admit is sort of the case and do

214
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:34,829
you go down the road of saying they need

215
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:38,139
to be broken up or broken into segments

216
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:42,608
well that of course isn't an interesting

217
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:45,519
question to what degree size matter in

218
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:47,649
that respect I think it's it's an

219
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,899
important discussion but maybe it's even

220
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:54,009
more important to discuss how to get

221
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:56,829
access to data because now we know that

222
00:09:54,009 --> 00:10:00,989
we all own our data but the thing is

223
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:05,019
that we give very often a royalty-free

224
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:09,220
license for the big companies to use our

225
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:13,239
data almost to whatever so for smaller

226
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,579
businesses to get access to huge amounts

227
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:17,769
of data to be able to innovate to be

228
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:20,888
able to provide services how can we

229
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:23,079
enable us to give this access since we

230
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,539
now own the data and that I think is

231
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:29,019
sort of the next phase as to figure out

232
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:31,059
how big data can be available also for

233
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:33,429
small and medium sized businesses who

234
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:35,279
are just in the process of getting there

235
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:37,899
and of course it's distinction between

236
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,019
personal data and non personal data yes

237
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:43,989
to conflate the two and the other

238
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:46,600
question that comes up repeatedly is the

239
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:48,659
speed with which competition cases move

240
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,269
and the Commission in particular I mean

241
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:55,269
we're talking about digitization and the

242
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:58,139
speed of innovation and a you know a

243
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:01,379
world that's moving incredibly fast how

244
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,949
can even competition keep pace

245
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,859
enforcement sorry competition

246
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:08,729
enforcement of course first of all we we

247
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:10,989
have to look we have to look dangerous

248
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:14,649
because the best thing is of course if

249
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:17,170
the rules are not broken which is

250
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:20,670
reason to give out fines that have a

251
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:23,800
sufficient level to have some deterrence

252
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,019
there is one thing though that is

253
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,899
inherent in the work we do and if I may

254
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:33,129
give a parallel if your house is broken

255
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:35,019
into it may take five minutes for

256
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:38,829
someone to get in find your valuables

257
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:42,009
out but it will take the police weeks

258
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:44,050
and the court system months to find the

259
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:46,480
guilty person to justice a guilty person

260
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,279
because we live in the Union based on

261
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,790
the rule of law and you have the right

262
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:54,029
to defend yourself and cases should be

263
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:57,910
fully supported by evidence and that

264
00:11:54,029 --> 00:12:00,610
asymmetry in time is of course also our

265
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,670
asymmetry and since we will never

266
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,769
compromise on due process and the right

267
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,729
to defend yourself and that our case you

268
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:09,100
should stand up in court

269
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,040
of course there's a limit to how fast we

270
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,980
can be that being said of course we

271
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,279
should digitalize as well and we do that

272
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,410
should we have an algorithm so that we

273
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:24,220
can police the markets to see what the

274
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:27,819
other algorithms are doing out there but

275
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,429
also should we have new rules and I have

276
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:33,309
asked the three extremely insightful

277
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:35,889
people one with an expertise in

278
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:38,920
economics one in competition law and one

279
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:40,480
in tech to come together and to give

280
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,279
advice and they will give their report

281
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,889
by March next year to look into the

282
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:48,009
future how to make sure that we make the

283
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:51,879
best in the marketplace in this digital

284
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:54,790
revolution and we will also have an open

285
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,379
conference by January or next year for

286
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,170
everyone to come and to offer their

287
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:01,259
perspectives so that we make sure that

288
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,990
we also get the right regulatory tools

289
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:06,850
to be able to stay relevant for all the

290
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,879
businesses who want to compete by the

291
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,639
book but to need an open market to be

292
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,799
able to do that okay I'm going to come

293
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,029
to some questions from the floor in just

294
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,799
a moment but I have another question

295
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,449
that I got off Twitter and if you do

296
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:22,420
want to tweet at us during this you can

297
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:24,969
use the hashtag tatra summit 18 so you

298
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,139
know please share beyond this Moomin and

299
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,350
this lovely setting what we're talking

300
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,510
about one of the questions was

301
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,040
attracts AI talent to Europe it's a

302
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,220
little bit of your beat but have you any

303
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:39,300
ideas well I think it's a very large

304
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,370
degree quality of life of course not

305
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,839
everyone can live here where the air is

306
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:48,240
crisp and sweets but but in many other

307
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:51,390
places you have also very high quality

308
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,140
of life you may have another work/life

309
00:13:51,390 --> 00:14:00,540
balance you have access to very good

310
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:02,460
infrastructure both partners can have a

311
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,890
job you have very good educational

312
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,400
system for for children I think one has

313
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,960
to realize that we have so much to offer

314
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,180
both when it comes to quality of life

315
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,850
when also when it comes to the quality

316
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:19,109
of doing business because Europe's earth

317
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:22,860
can cover the four pallets of what you

318
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:26,160
need reasonable taxes high skilled

319
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:29,400
people research and innovation good

320
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,370
governments very good infrastructure all

321
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,689
of that is working very well for us well

322
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,340
you mentioned taxes will probably come

323
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,380
on to that and just a moment first let

324
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:42,300
me see anyone in the room got questions

325
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:45,720
that they would like to ask no one in

326
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,280
this audience okay well let us come back

327
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,140
then you mentioned also very fresh air

328
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,250
so I feel like I should raise dieselgate

329
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:55,199
as an issue as well I want to ask

330
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,970
whether you know we see these scandals

331
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,520
and these these you know these breaches

332
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:03,900
of competition and abuses of dominance

333
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,040
and does this create a a sort of is sort

334
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,390
of askance at the beginning but do you

335
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,689
believe it actually creates distrust

336
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:15,180
amongst consumers yes I'm afraid so

337
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:17,970
because for for more and more consumers

338
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,849
it makes a difference that you can

339
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:26,520
actually not polluting the environment

340
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:28,230
for your co-citizens I think that one

341
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,030
thing is to say well this is the product

342
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,310
this is the upside this is the downside

343
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,740
this is what it is it's another thing to

344
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:39,119
say this is what it is and then it turns

345
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,830
out to be something else and I have

346
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,400
colleagues with the yoki cation and

347
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:46,630
heading this was you know

348
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:50,319
deep into investigating the diesel

349
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:54,400
scandal we just opened the investigation

350
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:58,750
of another type of car cartel which is

351
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,339
very specifically scoped because we of

352
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,339
course want businesses to work together

353
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,080
in an open fashion to innovate where

354
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,970
it's becomes too difficult to do it

355
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,860
one-on-one for instance on security

356
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,130
we're just talking about the battery

357
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,750
Alliance that makes extremely good sense

358
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,600
but what we suspect here is that a

359
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,360
number of car companies have agreed not

360
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:24,279
to use the most innovative technologies

361
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,710
to clean emissions to say well no we

362
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,650
will not use the best we agree among us

363
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:33,010
that we will not use the best technology

364
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:36,730
to clean exhaustion from petrol cars and

365
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:38,980
diesel cars of course to some degree I

366
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,830
hope not to be proven right because this

367
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,870
is of course very sad because also here

368
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:47,200
of course we competition in innovation

369
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:50,140
who can give you the best car also when

370
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,410
it comes to using the best technology in

371
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:58,029
order also to drive the others forward

372
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,920
literally in this case so I mean I mean

373
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:01,600
that's just the cases I mean sort of

374
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,589
highlighting what cases again there that

375
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,839
we're going to have to keep an eye on

376
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:07,720
and so let me ask you looking to the

377
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,688
future I mean do you see changes needed

378
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,150
perhaps in the area of policy law or

379
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:14,650
regulation or tax regulation just you

380
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,459
know for the next Commission coming

381
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:23,439
forward oh but in that case we have

382
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:25,630
prepared very well because even though

383
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,140
competition law enforcement is that's a

384
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:34,000
strong hammer obviously not everything

385
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:36,040
is a nail and it is I think a given that

386
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,730
we need for competition law enforcement

387
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:42,700
to work very closely with regulation as

388
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,290
how should the marketplace work like in

389
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,530
the relationship between business and

390
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:49,389
platforms because it comes back over and

391
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,000
over again that businesses say we have

392
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,650
no transparency we don't know what is

393
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,190
happening we don't know why it's

394
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,720
happening

395
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,240
and we don't know who to

396
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,530
to make it stop all of a sudden we

397
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,409
cannot be found anymore

398
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:05,200
our business is closing down it will be

399
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:08,230
in the area of Taxation on average

400
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,380
digital companies pay a nine percent in

401
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,210
taxes on average traditional businesses

402
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,179
with traditional business models paid

403
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,409
23% in taxes

404
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,600
it's the difference with more of more

405
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:23,500
than a hundred percent that's obviously

406
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,678
not fair and we don't think that our

407
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,440
proposals necessarily is perfect in that

408
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,330
respect but we're trying to update sort

409
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,970
of the very basic concept of corporate

410
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:38,129
taxation because everything digital

411
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,980
eise's data obviously also is a thing in

412
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:44,919
transportation in agriculture in health

413
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,950
so we better get our head together also

414
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:51,280
to figure out how to Taxation work in a

415
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:54,840
much more digital world world okay happy

416
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,840
any questions yes sir

417
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,600
fabian zurich from the european policy

418
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,260
center thank you very much commissioner

419
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,510
for those remarks I wanted to ask a

420
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,490
question about the global dimension to

421
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,940
this arguably

422
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,080
the other side of the coin to

423
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,809
digitalization to the technological

424
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,260
development is also the increase in

425
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:23,440
globalization global value chains which

426
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:27,960
is affecting companies in Europe quite

427
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:31,510
profoundly and we can arguably enforce

428
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,250
competition laws fair competition the

429
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,340
kind of rules which we think are

430
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:39,100
important within Europe but for our

431
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,678
companies it's also question in how far

432
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,199
they face fair competition elsewhere so

433
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,450
what can we do to make sure that the

434
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,710
global environment also follows those

435
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:53,669
rules okay thank you for that question

436
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:57,220
yep because that's a very good question

437
00:19:53,669 --> 00:20:00,610
which is why it is it is part of our

438
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:04,649
social or our global strategy to fight

439
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:07,959
harmful subsidies in a global manner I

440
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:10,419
have for instance a

441
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,630
never and ever understanding with my

442
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,180
Chinese counterparts to as a first step

443
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:20,230
create transparency when it comes to

444
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:22,600
subsidies and there's no reason to be

445
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,610
sort of too proud of ourselves when we

446
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,330
stopped counting a couple of years ago I

447
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:33,070
think in Europe we had handed out or at

448
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:36,010
least made available 691 billion euros

449
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:39,490
for our financial system in order to

450
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:41,230
keep that stable and it's just to say

451
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,330
that when you're open about what you do

452
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,120
yourself then you can to a greater

453
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:50,290
degree ask openness of other people in

454
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,560
the trade policy it's an issue as well

455
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:56,830
in the Japanese EU trade agreement just

456
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,360
finalized it's an agreement for them to

457
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,760
do away with a number of their most

458
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,100
harmful subsidies the ones that we would

459
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,190
never ever have here with the present

460
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,100
set of rules I think it's very important

461
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:12,580
what is done in in the reign of g7 and

462
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,219
g20 was also put this on the agenda to

463
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,250
create transparency in the reform of the

464
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,770
WTO this is also an issue because we

465
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,230
have reporting systems in the WTO set of

466
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,830
rules but they are obviously not being

467
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,440
used to full extent so it has to be a

468
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:32,260
global endeavor to have the harmful

469
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,360
subsidies come down and then of course I

470
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:38,620
think to some degree to be slightly more

471
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:41,260
hard-nosed than we used to be by having

472
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:46,149
access to do screening of foreign direct

473
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:49,300
investment to ask for reciprocity which

474
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:52,180
I thought should be a given because

475
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:56,379
trade is about having relationships so

476
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,300
is competition and I think in this way

477
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,070
we can have a very balanced approached

478
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,280
and still within sort of our global

479
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:07,450
multilateral set of rules and and

480
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,280
frameworks but does it frustrate you

481
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:14,010
that competition enforcement gets

482
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,690
dragged into other issues or co-opted oh

483
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:19,770
no it's always always great when people

484
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,770
talk about what you do

485
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,510
now I think the important thing is for

486
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,880
for the idea of competition to travel as

487
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,730
far as possible

488
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,760
but I think it is for us to fend for

489
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:36,670
ourselves to say as we for instance did

490
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,320
we have three some of them quite

491
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:42,370
controversial mergers in the

492
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,679
agrochemical sector to say people say

493
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:49,030
well you have to consider environmental

494
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:52,210
effects when seeds and pesticides gets

495
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:54,250
combined in one company and what we have

496
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,590
to say well we will look after the

497
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,420
farmer to make sure that he can turn to

498
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:02,260
someone else so she can turn to someone

499
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:05,559
else for a competing seed for competing

500
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,570
pesticides but environmental laws they

501
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,840
were in place before the merger during

502
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:14,309
the merger after the merger and and we

503
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:17,230
shouldn't just put it all into one big

504
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:19,570
ball but make sure that we have the

505
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,120
distinctions also because sometimes you

506
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,428
want much more environmental regulation

507
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,129
than what you would ever sort of put

508
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:30,580
into the area of competition same goes

509
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:34,330
for labor laws same goes for the the

510
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:37,899
current control of things that can give

511
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,879
us cancer all kinds of regulation and I

512
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,010
think it is very important that we are

513
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,990
strict to keep that in place and not

514
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,210
putting that into sort of the bowl of

515
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,679
curve of competition I mean isn't that

516
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,940
difficult with with the whole tech

517
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,130
sector as well where we can't quite

518
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,420
easily say we know what's going on and

519
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:57,130
we can't take if you like an almost

520
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:58,720
precautionary principle approach that I

521
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,900
didn't quite understand well I mean if

522
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,220
if we have for example algorithms

523
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,530
developing and and machine learning and

524
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,790
the wrong turn of experts for example

525
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,990
perhaps you have experts in the

526
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,190
Commission but they don't really

527
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,530
understand the nuts and bolts to say

528
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,059
this could be damaging whereas an

529
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,950
environmental law we will say this could

530
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:17,590
be damaging so we will take a you know a

531
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:20,110
precautionary approach to it oh well

532
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:23,080
that that may this is a very important

533
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:27,100
discussion we sort of we have taken we

534
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,780
have a tool of interim measures that is

535
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,399
very difficult to use but we have sort

536
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,399
of opened the door and put the tool on

537
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,730
our desk to be able to use it if we find

538
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,780
a good

539
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:39,610
case actually to use it for the problem

540
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,620
that we have is that in the Commission

541
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,770
we have a very very high legal bar to

542
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,260
pass that makes it very difficult which

543
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:51,760
is kind of the dilemma here to use it on

544
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:53,230
new things that we discover but since it

545
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,910
is exactly when new things are happening

546
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:58,330
you would want to be able to take

547
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:00,640
interim measures then of course we are

548
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,830
ready to use it if we find a case where

549
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,750
it would be useful to do that exactly

550
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,879
because of what you're saying keep our

551
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:18,490
eyes open for that any other questions

552
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:20,230
please anyone it's the view thank you an

553
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,420
ideological from the German Marshall

554
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,180
Fund of the United States in Brussels I

555
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,860
have a question about this taxation you

556
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,950
mentioned digital companies versus

557
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,139
traditional companies digital companies

558
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:34,360
9% texts traditional 23 so we have to

559
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,940
make it more fair my question is is your

560
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,669
understanding on more fair making the

561
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,440
taxes even lower or is it higher

562
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,460
especially when you would have to be

563
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,890
accountable as a politician

564
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:47,560
international governments where people

565
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,870
don't have even access or fair access to

566
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,800
health care pensions are extremely low

567
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,909
people live very below the decent

568
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:58,060
standards in most of the European

569
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,250
countries so what is actually fair in

570
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,169
terms of taxation of the big digital or

571
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:07,870
small budget digital companies or others

572
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:11,650
thank you well if taxes as such should

573
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:14,620
be higher or lower that is actually for

574
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:17,080
national governments to decide the point

575
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,709
that or the discussion where we have

576
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,080
tabled a proposal is to say sort of

577
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:28,030
old-school understanding of corporate

578
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:30,939
taxation cannot understand how value is

579
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:34,210
created in a digital company or how you

580
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:37,360
have a taxable presence if you take a

581
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:39,670
Google search this is not a product to

582
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,590
take from the self it's something where

583
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,990
you create value when you do the Google

584
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,100
search so your part of the value

585
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,440
creation here

586
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,530
so exactly created where you

587
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,170
our of course their algorithm and their

588
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:55,570
IP and so and so that plays a huge role

589
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:58,600
but the value cannot be created without

590
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:02,169
you doing the Google search so we have

591
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,570
to sort of rethink how value is created

592
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,450
in order to see value creation and

593
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,820
they've also tax valuation and the

594
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:12,090
second element is to see well what does

595
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,320
it mean to have a taxable presence

596
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:17,649
because some digital companies they

597
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,419
never set foot in your country the

598
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:23,380
server's they are in wonderful cold

599
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:25,410
northern no way to save energy but

600
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,630
actually they have a very good business

601
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,910
but they're not here how to understand

602
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,770
that how to make sure that we can see

603
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,810
when you do a good business and you

604
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,690
create value in the country that you

605
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:40,210
also have a taxable presence and without

606
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,670
these concepts being updated to a

607
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:45,040
digital world national governments

608
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:48,010
cannot even decide if taxes should be

609
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,460
higher or lower because there are things

610
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:53,410
that simply escape taxation and I think

611
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,690
we have to do that first and then of

612
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:59,110
course for governments responsible to

613
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,960
their national voters to decide where we

614
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:04,719
tax more will we tax less because there

615
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,460
can be needs in the Member States that

616
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,170
their politicians would want to address

617
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,760
okay it's your last chance ladies and

618
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:15,220
gentlemen have we any more questions in

619
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,129
the room before I go to Twitter for the

620
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,870
most burning question of the day nope

621
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,150
so the question people in Twitter were

622
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:25,260
asking is what's your favorite cocktail

623
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:29,040
[Laughter]

624
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:32,560
I'm kind of a traditional woman in that

625
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:36,360
that would be a gin and tonic okay well

626
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,360
thank you very much would be my pleasure

627
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:46,190
a Thank You commissioner

628
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:48,080
and we got to the end of that without

629
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,669
anyone using the phrase data is the new

630
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,980
oil so well done everyone

631
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:53,779
now I would like to invite to join me

632
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,029
please Daniel cotton Sookie who is the

633
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:59,200
chairman of the board of directors of EP

634
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:59,200
Holdings Thank You Daniel

635
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,350
so a very straightforward first question

636
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:08,149
you were listening very attentively what

637
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,240
struck you most about the commissioners

638
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:14,059
remarks they were indeed many of them

639
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,760
very inspiring and I wouldn't say that

640
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:19,158
anything struck me on its own but what I

641
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,889
would add and probably follow up on what

642
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:23,450
she what she rightfully indicated is

643
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:25,879
that I think really we are in a

644
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:28,909
situation where especially for digital

645
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,370
economy we cannot rely only on antitrust

646
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:33,169
we all need to be mindful of the fact

647
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,879
and it's quite paradoxical because

648
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:37,309
actually I am representing the business

649
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,919
sphere but we have to be we have to be

650
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:42,500
mindful that with the digital economy we

651
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,929
have entered into a zone where the

652
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,330
traditional monopolies are effectively

653
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:50,179
toys for kids compared to the monopolies

654
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:53,960
that are raising up today maybe I can

655
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:59,090
quote a few figures I'm sure most of you

656
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:04,100
will well know them but anyway the share

657
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:05,840
of nine largest digital companies on the

658
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,500
digital economy on the digital revenues

659
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,220
is 90 percent four out of the nine are

660
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,519
in China or located in China five are

661
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,690
taking care of rest of the world

662
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:22,730
combined EBT a Saudi gross earnings

663
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:26,960
produced by Apple Google and Facebook

664
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:30,080
are 160 billion US dollars annually

665
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,440
which is probably 10 times Slovak state

666
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,860
budget annually and it's growing by 20

667
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,730
percent for Google and 50 percent for

668
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:43,158
Facebook we have globally four point

669
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:47,779
five to four point seven billion users

670
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:51,260
of mobile devices out of which 90% is

671
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:53,420
served either by the Android produced

672
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:59,210
Google which is I think 77% and

673
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:02,330
reminding 13% by Apple share of Google

674
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:07,640
and Facebook on the growth of digital

675
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:09,860
advertisement is well above 90% not only

676
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,440
that we have the new problem of big data

677
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:15,020
and the problem of big data is that

678
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,690
effectively big majority of the big data

679
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:21,320
in an organized way is in the position

680
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:24,380
of these big tech companies these big

681
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,780
tech companies are also leaders in the

682
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,500
artificial intelligence the best

683
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,760
existing algorithm is the alpha zero

684
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:39,320
created by deep mind which has been

685
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:45,110
acquired by Google more I would also add

686
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,490
that an important feature of these

687
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:49,010
companies and I can hundred percent

688
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,020
understand it and I have to say that I

689
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,180
fully appreciate their great

690
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,250
contributions to our lives to the

691
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,840
economic growth in a way they saved us

692
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,660
otherwise I think we would have faced

693
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,629
serious issues but they've enable a new

694
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,640
wave of innovation and I mean I'm

695
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,070
actually very much admiring what they

696
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,350
were what they were able to create in so

697
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:11,270
short period of time but we also need to

698
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,959
appreciate that

699
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:16,400
these really global monopolies

700
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,220
unprecedent scale never ever in the

701
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,130
history any company was even close to

702
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,840
have the power of the big tech and

703
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,700
especially Google who is paradox we

704
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,580
bring also the highest value to the

705
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:31,840
society so we have to say that these

706
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:36,199
companies has still the spirit of growth

707
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,750
and taking over so contrary to the much

708
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,110
much smaller monopolies in the physical

709
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,050
world

710
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:45,469
or real real economy they keep growing

711
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:48,919
if they see a potential competitor a new

712
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:50,120
force they could that could change that

713
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,170
could that could move the needle and

714
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,360
change the balance they would

715
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:56,000
immediately acquired Facebook owns

716
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,389
Instagram Google owns YouTube Google

717
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,240
acquired demand which could have moved

718
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:05,190
the needle in different way so we are in

719
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,580
a situation that existing country

720
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:10,740
fools even with all the efforts of the

721
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,659
Commissioner cannot bring answers to

722
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,300
these questions I think we seriously

723
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,550
need and this is in the interest of the

724
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:20,010
big tech we need a completely new

725
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:22,980
regulation a completely new regulation

726
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:25,350
that would set up rules rules on which

727
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,660
we can rely with rules that would

728
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:31,169
mitigate the biggest risks before the

729
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:34,620
big text each hour a stand and and

730
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:36,960
themselves but at the same time rules

731
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,330
which then would be if possible stable

732
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,030
so that they can rely on it and they can

733
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:43,770
understand what is their space where

734
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:47,160
they can grow and which rules they need

735
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:48,480
to they need to follow because we they

736
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,970
are bringing the service and they

737
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,500
deserve to be the biggest companies in

738
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,480
the world which they are today they

739
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,330
intended for sure they are going to

740
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,730
exponentially grow in any case maybe two

741
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:03,620
that allow me three or four small

742
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:06,140
examples and then I'll stop talking

743
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:09,540
imagine the world of energy which is my

744
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,490
original world everybody who knows the

745
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,800
third energy directive of the European

746
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:16,259
of the European Commission knows how

747
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,050
strict rules we need to follow there are

748
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,810
strict rules of unbundling there are

749
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:24,480
strict rules saying how and in how much

750
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,190
independent where you can operate power

751
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,980
or gas transmission system distribution

752
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:32,190
system storage system supply production

753
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,080
or very very strict rules if you operate

754
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:36,570
an infrastructure you need to always

755
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,090
operate it in a transparent way you need

756
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:42,440
to allow free access to all players in

757
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:44,730
an equal way Internet is a huge

758
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,860
communication infrastructure it's an

759
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:49,080
information infrastructure the most

760
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,450
global one never we had any global

761
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,400
infrastructure of any similar kind for

762
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:56,189
that infrastructure we have absolutely

763
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,600
no rules effectively Google Facebook and

764
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,640
all the other companies without these

765
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,960
rules I have to say logically what they

766
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,569
are doing they are effective in hard

767
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,590
selling their own products when talking

768
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,440
about transparency

769
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,880
now with the new algorithm of Google

770
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,250
sometimes if you want to find the first

771
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,480
unpaid result of the search you need to

772
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,640
scroll when you're on your mobile

773
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,320
etcetera etcetera but I will say that

774
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,339
this is their problem this is really the

775
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,100
problem of completely missing

776
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,080
missing crews because in that situation

777
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,450
the structure just takes the place

778
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,830
that's that's one example the other

779
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,859
example which is for me absolutely

780
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:32,670
striking is the example of regulation in

781
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:35,260
the media if you are a small publisher

782
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:38,260
having probably producing a magazine

783
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,970
that would have 10,000 readers you have

784
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,560
tons of obligations in terms of

785
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,020
protection of third parties rights and

786
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,270
you are responsible for all the content

787
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,210
in your little magazine if you are a

788
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:50,980
facebook and you are operating or you

789
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:54,190
are effectively operating because they

790
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:56,800
are operator of the structure you are

791
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:59,410
operating a public public web page that

792
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,390
has six million users you have no

793
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,069
obligation even not to not you even are

794
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,259
not obliged to know who is producing the

795
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:08,350
page it's like if we had a huge TV

796
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:11,140
channel that would broker broadcast all

797
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:13,930
over the globe and broadcast to the

798
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,299
massive population any content even the

799
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:18,520
most not not even with the arguments

800
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,430
that it didn't produce it unthinkable in

801
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:24,160
the real world but fully realistic in

802
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,930
the digital world for Texas the

803
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,140
Commission I would share with you the

804
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:30,870
reality of this region in this region

805
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,549
and sorry I will use the Czech example

806
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:35,230
because it was for me faster to find it

807
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,660
in the Czech Republic

808
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:40,300
Google generates probably because it's

809
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:45,270
not published probably 200 million euros

810
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:48,070
of sales the Texas are 0.1% of the sales

811
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:55,560
200,000 euros to Texas or Facebook are

812
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:55,560
to make it simple 0 ok voice in my ear

813
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,740
there's you've covered a lot of ground

814
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:05,770
there in in one big mouthful and I want

815
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:09,009
to try and pick apart some bits so I

816
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:11,170
mean one of the things there you said I

817
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,760
mean we're supposed to talking about

818
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,030
entrepreneurship in this in this section

819
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,400
and you talked about Google gobbling up

820
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,720
board not just I mean I'm school sits in

821
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,000
my eyeline but you know these big

822
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,379
companies but I mean you can put laws in

823
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,150
place but if there is a culture where

824
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,400
startups are really only trying to be

825
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,920
and they're measure of success is to be

826
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,450
bought by these big companies isn't

827
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,080
there some sort of cultural change that

828
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,350
needs to have

829
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:38,890
they're I think really we cannot rely on

830
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:41,080
culture and the simple the simple reason

831
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,660
is that the digital world is evolving

832
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,630
super fast the companies need to think

833
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:49,060
super fast and need to act super fast we

834
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:52,360
really need to define the playground

835
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,970
tell them and I repeat again if I was a

836
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,470
shareholder of Google I would really

837
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:59,290
support that idea because otherwise

838
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:01,259
there is no other way then we will at

839
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:04,210
the end of the day I do really have a

840
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,820
giant problem or witness miracle for

841
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,140
Rockefeller case or rather antitrust

842
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,320
case that would put the famous local

843
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,790
case somewhere completely in the in the

844
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,040
cordon because it cannot continue so

845
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:18,490
what I think really we need to think

846
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,710
about the right rules what is the degree

847
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:23,229
of vertical integration

848
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:25,630
what part to what extent for instance

849
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,950
Big Data should be public and there

850
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,250
should be a free access to it in a

851
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:32,049
structured way but you know - what

852
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,060
and now we can think of many others for

853
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:36,450
instance the the topic that I have

854
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:39,070
quoted for me is an easy one why

855
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:40,689
somebody who is effectively producing a

856
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:42,790
media business in the digital world

857
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,950
should not have the same obligation acts

858
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,120
like somebody in the real world and when

859
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,100
there are many many questions of course

860
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,710
I don't know the answers but what and

861
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:54,819
what I greatly believe in is that really

862
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:56,860
there has to be a new regulation but but

863
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,230
what is crucially important the

864
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,720
regulation must not be a fight against

865
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,790
the big tech this would be completely

866
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:07,209
completely wrong it has to be a debate

867
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:09,580
about what are the good rules and the

868
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,800
rules which are sustainable so they

869
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:15,160
trade off for the big tech is to is to

870
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:18,640
tell them unfortunately this is not how

871
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,710
it can go because it's far too much but

872
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,810
these are rules we will stand behind and

873
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,850
if you are within the rules then you can

874
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,170
grow and you can do your business maybe

875
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,779
they will have to give up some

876
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:30,700
businesses maybe artificial intelligence

877
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:33,580
has to be separated from the company

878
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,649
that is owning the big data maybe it has

879
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,440
to be running the independent way maybe

880
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,610
if you have search you need you need to

881
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,350
give up other parts of your business

882
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,600
model all that has to be all there has

883
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,009
to be debated but ultimately there is no

884
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,910
doubt that the growth of these companies

885
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,980
are going to be

886
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:50,470
is going to be exponential and this will

887
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,210
be the far far they are or the today far

888
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,890
largest companies in the world and they

889
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:56,200
are going to be much much bigger in any

890
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,930
case but I think the trade-off is for

891
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,450
sustainability and for your question the

892
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:04,480
money in the digital world is there by

893
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:07,808
the way I have a remark here the three

894
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,440
companies epic Google and Facebook are

895
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:14,680
holding on the accounts 370 billion u.s.

896
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,650
dollars 20 to 25 times so vexed a budget

897
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,450
so I think for the guys who are willing

898
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,250
to you know to develop their own

899
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,808
projects products and then be bought by

900
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,940
them there is enough and there will be

901
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:27,849
much much much more so that motivation

902
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,920
is going to be preserved regardless and

903
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:32,530
any any any rules are going to be

904
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,359
implemented I mean taking for example

905
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,619
that of the media company we did just

906
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:38,020
see a vote in the European Parliament

907
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:40,270
last week on the AVM s the audiovisual

908
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,980
media services directive they're pushing

909
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:46,240
for that so you know you need to get out

910
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,920
but let me on pick a bit this idea of

911
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,049
big data because big data is not just

912
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,240
simply one thing big data is made up of

913
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:54,190
personal and non personal data and and

914
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,229
they are treated in hugely different

915
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,880
ways and we have then we've got within

916
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,650
the realm of big data vaults with open

917
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,660
data and you know they were planted last

918
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,190
week I hosted the EU data thon which was

919
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:06,220
you know encouraging young people to

920
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,740
develop apps using the the EU open data

921
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,740
portal I mean there's only so much in

922
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:16,479
terms you know that that's a key you

923
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:18,868
institutions backed project but if we do

924
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,160
then think that the data is a commodity

925
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:24,760
how would you persuade a company to give

926
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,980
away their commodity do we do that you

927
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,140
know it has actually happened many times

928
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,630
in the real world and again I feel now a

929
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,549
bit a bit strange because again I'm not

930
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,200
fighter against the big tech by the way

931
00:41:33,549 --> 00:41:37,089
my main business is energy but we have

932
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,759
invested also in e-commerce and I'm

933
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:41,288
great believer in that business and in

934
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,240
the value of the business but at the

935
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:45,670
same time there were situations when one

936
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,609
company owned the infrastructure it

937
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,289
owned all the clients data it served the

938
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:51,549
whole business in the energy business in

939
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:53,319
the energy world that has been the

940
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:55,210
business model 20 years ago fully

941
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:56,680
implemented now we have a completely new

942
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:59,670
business model where the infrastructure

943
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,660
is separated from the clients business

944
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,910
so something which has been unthinkable

945
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:06,129
in the real world can be implemented of

946
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,319
course it's much more complex of course

947
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,060
it's much more complex but I'm just

948
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:14,140
simply saying we really need to think

949
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:15,850
about the rules and start also signal

950
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,799
where it well where it will where it

951
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,839
will go because otherwise is going to be

952
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,350
a huge crashing it's I would say five

953
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:26,710
minutes after after after off after

954
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,339
twelve after twelve for me have we

955
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,160
questions

956
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:32,370
oh very fast okay I don't know who is

957
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,370
quicker

958
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:37,150
good afternoon amongst a host car

959
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,760
journalist Ramos profs kind of an a

960
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:42,520
Czech newspaper mr. krichinsky

961
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,580
you have also spoken about me about the

962
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:49,840
media and you own media in the Czech

963
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:52,810
Republic and now also in France why are

964
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,060
you now investing let's say quite a bit

965
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:57,400
quite massively in the media what's your

966
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,880
what's your business plan there or why

967
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:04,870
are you going from the energy sector now

968
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:10,240
to media thank you thank you for

969
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:13,060
thinking and I'll answer to that in the

970
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,270
same way of course it has more angles

971
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:18,009
but the main one is that I'm a true

972
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,410
believer in the fact that traditional

973
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:22,540
media and traditional journalism are

974
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:25,180
effectively an incredibly important

975
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:27,640
pillar of European democracy we have

976
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:30,940
lived and our democracy democracy have

977
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:35,290
worked in a sustainable way based on the

978
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:36,970
principle by the way of quality

979
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:39,009
interpretation of information the

980
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:41,140
European citizens were for decades or

981
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:43,510
centuries given information and

982
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,279
immediate interpretation of the

983
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,410
information the interpretation of the

984
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,790
information was the work of the

985
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:52,210
qualified journalist

986
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:53,529
so the person from the street the normal

987
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:55,480
citizen has drifted in from from

988
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,160
information you know this is what has

989
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,660
happened at the level of state budget at

990
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,970
the level of the International Affairs

991
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:04,180
and they and then immediately you

992
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:06,339
received the interpretation it is good

993
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,379
or bad for this and this reason and the

994
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,569
interpretation played enormous role in

995
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,489
the education process of the voters

996
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:15,949
for the elections and we had a quality

997
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:20,150
vote in the Western European democracies

998
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:21,440
for many decades high quality vote what

999
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,989
we have now with the domain of

1000
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,199
digitalization unfortunately is a change

1001
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:29,239
of behavior of us these citizens and

1002
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,430
what we are doing on the Internet is

1003
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:33,529
that we are just scanning what is

1004
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:35,598
happening there we are reading only the

1005
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:37,759
titles if we read and if a page at all

1006
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,430
and the reason is that we are really

1007
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:43,160
bringing up a generation of complete

1008
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:44,359
political ignorance our own education

1009
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,799
Goes Down and the new generation is

1010
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:47,569
completing and so what I think that it

1011
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:49,430
is really necessary to support this and

1012
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:52,099
because of all the trends the media

1013
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:53,448
houses are so strong so sorry so weak

1014
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:55,219
and so much underneath that

1015
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:56,900
unfortunately they need to be sponsored

1016
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:58,699
and this is what we are doing and

1017
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,619
unfortunately we have to leave it

1018
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:02,690
because we have speakers for our next

1019
00:45:00,619 --> 00:45:04,219
panel waiting but it's such a huge issue

1020
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,390
thank you very much I'm sure we will

1021
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:05,670
talk much more about that in the coming

1022
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:11,699
days

1023
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:11,699
[Applause]
