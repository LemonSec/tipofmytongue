1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,820
I think we all know why we're here I'd

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,250
like to bring up the panel that we've

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,619
all been waiting for as quickly as

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,630
possible but I know if we've opened a

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,750
newspaper in the last couple of years or

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,970
months especially or our mobile phones

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,289
the bad news just keeps flowing and

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,150
flowing and the good news is hard to

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,619
find so to figure out what we're going

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,470
to do in terms of acting and reacting

11
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,900
I'd like to invite our finance ministers

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,210
up on stage but first could I get

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:44,640
undressed Reiko he is the CEO of our

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,530
group Bank up on stage followed by His

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,300
Excellency Peter Casimir Deputy Prime

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,040
Minister and Minister of Finance of the

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,930
Slovak Republic His Excellency Olaf

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,399
Schultz vice-chancellor and Federal

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,160
Minister of Finance of the Federal

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,200
Republic of Germany and last but

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,940
definitely not the least his Excellency

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,410
Bruno the mayor he has Minister of

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:13,860
Economy and Finance of the French

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:15,390
Republic gentlemen I think the easiest

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,240
way to start once our waters are

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,390
refreshed and changed would be to

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,390
consider the news there has been flowing

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,550
continuously especially since 2016 if we

29
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,940
discount all the news before that when

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,910
it came to the financial crisis we've

31
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,959
got issues with transatlantic

32
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,348
relationships we've got a potential

33
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:40,470
brewing trade war we've got problems at

34
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:44,099
home with populism the fragmentation

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,300
we've got autocratic governments that

36
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,340
are starting to raise their head

37
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,399
corruption issues that are starting to

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,560
come to the forefront it almost feels

39
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,090
like the good news is drowned in the bad

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,580
so and there is good news

41
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,700
I mean unemployment levels are pretty

42
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,289
darn good businesses are starting to

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,340
invest and we're seeing the investment

44
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:11,068
plan scientists show some amount of

45
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,930
success so what I'd like for us to do on

46
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,988
the stage to lay out the groundwork is

47
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:20,340
to say what are the three top concerns

48
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:23,489
for you individually when it comes to

49
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,209
what can impact the European economy

50
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,560
and Minister Lim if I can start with you

51
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,540
it would be good to kind of set the

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,629
stage for what concerns individual

53
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,700
countries in Europe and of course the

54
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,890
businesses thank you

55
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,390
good news is that the weather is

56
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,809
beautiful in that house

57
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,358
thank you better as far as the concern

58
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,510
are concerned I will be very brief I

59
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:50,489
think that the first concern for the

60
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,179
French economy and for the European

61
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:57,079
economy as a whole and for the world

62
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,629
economy is a risk of a trade war I

63
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:03,180
really think that the risk of a trade

64
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,798
war might jeopardize growth all over

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,720
Europe and all over the world and

66
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,079
especially a trade war between the

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,459
United States and China and I think that

68
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,799
the role of the European countries

69
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,409
should be to try to alleviate those

70
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,709
difficulties and to try to find

71
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:21,950
solutions to the risk of that trade war

72
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:26,129
the second concern is the lack of

73
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:28,138
convergence among EU countries we need

74
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:31,290
more convergence especially within the

75
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,510
euro zone more convergence as far as

76
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,370
competitiveness of the private companies

77
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:41,040
is concerned but also more convergence

78
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:45,299
in the way we are dealing with our

79
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,750
public expenses and public debt we are

80
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,519
all on the same boat and that's why

81
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,519
France is doing its best to try to

82
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:57,359
reduce the level of public expenses and

83
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,579
to meet the European commitments because

84
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:01,769
we are all on the same boat and if there

85
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:04,290
is any difficulty in one single country

86
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,689
one member of the eurozone it might have

87
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,509
an effect on all the other members and

88
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:12,989
the third concern is the risk of having

89
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:16,608
a new financial crisis without having

90
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:20,310
being able to build the necessary tools

91
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:23,849
to face that financial crisis we should

92
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:27,240
never forget that we are still living

93
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:31,020
the consequences of the financial crisis

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,990
of 2008 and that our citizen is waiting

95
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,479
for us to take two dramatic decisions

96
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,110
and necessary decisions

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,110
to face any kind of new financial crisis

98
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,960
we have built the eurozone to be strong

99
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,650
and to be together and to be able to

100
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,130
face such a new financial crisis that's

101
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,349
gently yeah thank you for the question

102
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,020
there is a long list I would be able to

103
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:01,200
tell you but I will stick to three so

104
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,140
the first is also the question of trade

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,219
in the globalized economy I think this

106
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:11,360
is how we should put it and what is our

107
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,160
answers to that we learn in these days

108
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,050
what a luck the European Union is for

109
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,650
all of us because otherwise we would be

110
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,290
in much bigger problems and not a single

111
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,989
country is now facing discussions with

112
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,150
the United States about trade it's all

113
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,880
the European Union and it was really

114
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,739
amazing to see when we went there as

115
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,420
ministers to discuss with our colleagues

116
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,490
from the American administrations that

117
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,350
they administration that they learn from

118
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,420
day to day that there really is

119
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,000
something called the European Union and

120
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,250
that they have to tackle with them and

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,980
so I think it's it's the difficulty we

122
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,650
have to face but it's also a promise in

123
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,650
the experience we have today the second

124
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,750
is I will really subscribe what Bruno

125
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:59,190
said that we have to fulfill all the

126
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:04,170
questions which are still on the agenda

127
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:07,260
to of doing the task after the last

128
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:09,690
financial crisis we did a lot but we are

129
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,480
not we have not succeeded with the with

130
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,670
the necessary steps and we should so

131
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,820
that we are better prepared as before

132
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,740
2008 and 9 and so I think this is what

133
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,810
we have to do and I think there must be

134
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,410
progress even up to the end of that year

135
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,990
to be prepared no one of us knows

136
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:32,010
whether the next big financial crisis

137
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,590
might happen in one year or in 20 but as

138
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,590
we are not the ones deciding about the

139
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:40,190
crisis when they come it is necessary to

140
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:45,179
be prepared and to be that all the times

141
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:46,890
the third is I could mention some

142
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,740
economic questions but we will have time

143
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:55,440
to debate them so I will say the

144
00:06:49,740 --> 00:07:01,110
that will speak about the question which

145
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,580
bothers me most today we are losing

146
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,669
trust in confidence

147
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,008
the people are not very happy in the

148
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:10,830
most rich and most industrialized

149
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,720
countries this is happening in Europe

150
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,280
this is happening in North America this

151
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,400
is happening in Japan and this is

152
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,409
happening in the Australian occupy so

153
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,989
the traditional industrialized economies

154
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,880
are the ones were still the riches of

155
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,180
the world and who will be for a long

156
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,219
time but they are not that confident

157
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,569
that there is a good future for them in

158
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,960
their children and their grandchildren

159
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:38,090
and this produces a lot of political

160
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:41,870
problems and the rise of wrong answers

161
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:44,489
to problem to the problems we face and

162
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,500
why this is happening we see that all

163
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,569
over in the world many people are

164
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,759
looking quite confident to their future

165
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,370
there is one billion people there

166
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:57,120
raising to the middle class in Asia and

167
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:00,780
other places and we have people who are

168
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,120
unemployed unskilled and uneducated have

169
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:08,190
no access to water and and and and and

170
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,560
it's reducing dramatically but this is

171
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,599
the problem we face and to be very

172
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,370
honest I think the answer we have to

173
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,229
give at the place we live is the

174
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,659
European Union because this is the only

175
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,330
way to tackle the problems and possibly

176
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:25,099
to develop a future where people are

177
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,258
more confident about us they are today

178
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:31,620
you're in an interesting position

179
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:35,130
definitely geographically and in terms

180
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,649
of just the way you have to juxtapose

181
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,870
these viewpoints what are your top three

182
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,640
concerns sometimes it seems to me

183
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,630
sometimes that you know we are the

184
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,730
generation of people after the 2008 the

185
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,520
generation of people which is waiting

186
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,899
for the another crisis you know and this

187
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,640
is not that it is not good because we

188
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:59,360
did a lot in in many areas and okay I'm

189
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,040
coming from the country so very as a

190
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,420
country with with very successful story

191
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,020
we are talking about

192
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,839
come across which figures about 4% this

193
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,280
year next year four and a half percent

194
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,650
and we are talking about the Michigan

195
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,199
for grew but all we know that we all

196
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,150
know the island no that's that's there's

197
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,310
a division of labor between the there is

198
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:25,530
a big big influence of German economy

199
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:28,650
and and so so we know where we are but

200
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:32,360
we are you know in the area of the

201
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:35,069
raising wave of of populism egoism and

202
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,330
and protectionism you know and and these

203
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,160
this global trends are really threats

204
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,560
for us and and and in my view you know

205
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,050
it's this is the momentum to deliver you

206
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,150
know and once all of mentioned the lack

207
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,310
of trust this is a I think this is the

208
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:52,800
biggest problem and because I'm talking

209
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,209
about the stability of political systems

210
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,579
in our countries you know and it's

211
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:00,660
dramatic dramatically change you know

212
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:04,770
over last ten years you know so I'm a

213
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,079
little bit frustrated looking at the

214
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,650
process of the process of for example a

215
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,320
deepening of EMU you know this is one

216
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,959
very important issue we are already

217
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,300
committed to the further integration we

218
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:23,120
are pleased with with franco-german

219
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:26,670
paper Mesenbourg paper presented just

220
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,530
several months everal of weeks ago but

221
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,689
what we see that you know we

222
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,939
policymakers in Europe we all we know

223
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,730
what what should be done you know so

224
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:40,290
media knows business businesses knows

225
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:43,620
but there's a still we are not doing

226
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:46,589
that know and so we are we are behind

227
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,630
the curve because because we are

228
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,670
exporting and is my personal view be

229
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:55,560
exporting we used to export our domestic

230
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:57,839
problems on the European level and to be

231
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:02,000
very short and you know looking forward

232
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,680
you know so this this this shorten

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,380
shorten procedure so short in the

234
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:13,170
projects it's it's very dangerous to us

235
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:15,540
and the further integration or or the

236
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,979
this this is our destiny this is my

237
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,199
personal view

238
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,410
but you know and at the European level

239
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:23,790
this is always European so European this

240
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,980
is the second you know this is not the

241
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:32,339
first that's a pity I think mmm I think

242
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,579
it it brings in a facet that I'd love to

243
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:39,120
hear from a banking perspective when we

244
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,888
talk about a deepening EMU we're talking

245
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,110
about the banking Union still not

246
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:48,899
complete at some point what worries you

247
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,610
and keeps you up at night when you're

248
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,310
running a business the way you are

249
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,980
however you know I don't consider myself

250
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,079
a banker I consider myself an

251
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,639
entrepreneur who happens to run a

252
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:05,010
financial company and since I'm I'm I'm

253
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:10,970
the only member of the working class on

254
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:14,760
this podium let me take let me take a

255
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:19,610
different view know that the working

256
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:25,380
class they present is paid quite well I

257
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:31,110
don't think that's bad I'm dividends

258
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:34,649
paid to the brink let's get your top

259
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,290
three concerns maybe I can I can I can

260
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:40,860
really tell you the one thing that that

261
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,769
really worries me because I am an

262
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,410
incredibly engaged European I love

263
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:49,889
Europe and III actually think it's the

264
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:53,100
best place to live in the world and and

265
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:55,110
one of my fears is that in the future if

266
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,389
Europe continues like that we will still

267
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,940
be probably the loveliest place in the

268
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:03,449
world to live in but we will only get

269
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,550
tourists and and that that shouldn't

270
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,050
that that could be okay for parts of

271
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:10,079
Europe but but all in all I think we

272
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,779
shouldn't go that way and if I look back

273
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,430
at what we did with with with our

274
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:18,000
company and and I tell you why I

275
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,920
mentioned that is that I only started to

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,370
really understand what I'm here for

277
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,979
when I started to understand the why why

278
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,079
does my company actually exist and it

279
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,150
took us a long time we all know what we

280
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,400
do and how we do it but

281
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,790
actually we found out long before the

282
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,800
crisis hopefully thanks God that we are

283
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,420
here to create prosperity for the people

284
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,380
in the region in which we work that's

285
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,089
our only purpose and nothing else and if

286
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,150
I compare now and if you look at the

287
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:50,700
trade war the three main economic areas

288
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:54,270
in the world I know pretty much what the

289
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,670
Chinese want and they run China a bit

290
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,670
like a company and and and they regard

291
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,699
the 1.2 billion Chinese as their

292
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:05,729
employees who slowly start to benefit

293
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,610
from the management of the country and I

294
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,590
think for the moment also in the United

295
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,440
States people know what the government

296
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:16,290
really wants whether you like it or not

297
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,470
but they're here for basically making

298
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:22,230
sure that America beats everybody else

299
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:24,390
economically in the world and everybody

300
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,310
else is a competitor so they have a

301
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,910
clear why you might not like that why

302
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:33,089
but they have it and I my biggest fear

303
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:35,819
is actually can we get Europe actually

304
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:38,820
the politicians in Europe in Brussels

305
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,030
and in the countries to commonly agree

306
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,000
on what do we want to make out of Europe

307
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:47,250
and is there a chance that at some point

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,210
in time during the next five ten years

309
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:53,490
you will have a Europe of twenty seven

310
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:55,470
where everybody says the same thing this

311
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,090
is where we want to have Europe in the

312
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:02,000
future this is what Europe actually

313
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:06,150
stands for do we stand for liberal free

314
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,460
economy with a lot more equality than in

315
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,439
other countries so the rich people are

316
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,920
willing to give up more in order to help

317
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:17,160
or not do we want to have open borders

318
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,300
or not and I'm getting very worried on

319
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,270
what I see

320
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,430
during the last year's because what I

321
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,890
experienced for the moment is exactly

322
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:29,520
the opposite of what I hoped for Europe

323
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:31,350
would be as you know I was extremely the

324
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,189
the most joyful moment for me as a

325
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:38,940
Central European was 1989 and even more

326
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:42,510
so when finally slovak Porsches and and

327
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,000
Hungarian BMWs and polish Mercedes

328
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:48,300
passed me by on the Austrian motorway

329
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,220
and I had no borders and now I have a

330
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,329
border basically I have to wait on the

331
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,460
border to Germany because being check it

332
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,230
it's it's a development that goes in the

333
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,790
wrong direction so I don't know where

334
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,740
you're actually stands for for the

335
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,500
moment and I don't know whether our

336
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,020
politicians will be able to agree on

337
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,490
what Europe should be for the people in

338
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,130
the world I think that's a question for

339
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:14,370
the two of you because I think at some

340
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,630
point and I there has been a lot of

341
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,370
there have been a lot of headlines in

342
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,070
the last couple of days no thanks to the

343
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,020
country I currently reside in and I'm

344
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,850
surprised that neither of you brought

345
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,410
that up as a rather large concern we

346
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,020
know your viewpoints on it

347
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:32,010
those were top headlines as well but at

348
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:34,560
some point you need to I think that that

349
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,450
concern of whereas Europe headed we

350
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,030
don't have the banking Union as I

351
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,830
mentioned you've talked about wanting to

352
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,980
look at it completed in the next couple

353
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:47,490
of months but we have Deposit Insurance

354
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:51,090
issues we don't have any sort of a

355
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:55,320
agreement and a solid answer to the tech

356
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:58,080
the tax on tech companies there are lots

357
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,820
of little gaps as Andrews was pointing

358
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:05,220
out where Europe doesn't talk together

359
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,320
same answer yes question first of all

360
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,130
these are technical questions but the

361
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:16,290
key question raised by the only worker

362
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:18,240
on the stage is a political one and I

363
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,740
think that we should raise the stake and

364
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,910
that's the difficulty that we are all

365
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:27,920
facing and we should all try to

366
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:31,770
understand why populist parties

367
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:35,670
extremist parties are gaining voters all

368
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:39,540
over Europe in Germany in France in

369
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:44,520
Italy all over Europe we have to face

370
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:46,050
that key political challenge to me

371
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,190
because of the lack of political

372
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:54,300
willingness the lack of decisions and

373
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:56,070
the lack of vision for the eurozone for

374
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,550
instance we have all the tools

375
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:02,580
on the table we just have to decide for

376
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:05,940
the digital taxation we have been

377
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:08,280
discussing for more than 12 months we

378
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:12,120
have a formal proposal from the EU

379
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:15,780
Commission we just have to decide what

380
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,350
are we waiting for and then we have a

381
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:23,639
lack of vision I think that the basic of

382
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:26,879
Europe is liberal democracy and we

383
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:31,560
should stick to that because liberal

384
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,800
democracy now are at stake then we have

385
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:38,159
the political purposes that might gather

386
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,100
all the European people first the fight

387
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,890
against inequalities that's a point rise

388
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,120
by Olaf and I really think that this is

389
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,550
a critical issue

390
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,580
we don't want an economy in which the

391
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:53,310
rich people are growing richer and

392
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,730
richer and the poorest people do not

393
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:59,010
have any possibility to become rich we

394
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,350
need to fight against inequalities for

395
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,660
the sake of preserving our cultural and

396
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,889
political model and also for the sake of

397
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:10,140
economic efficiency that's the first

398
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,660
political purpose that we should put on

399
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,090
the table together the open people the

400
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,300
second one is the fight against climate

401
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,939
change we are the only continent which

402
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:24,240
has the willingness to really fight

403
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:27,120
clearly and in an efficient way against

404
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,900
climate change the us have got rid of

405
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:34,260
that China is not able and is not in a

406
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:37,440
situation to go this way so we have

407
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:42,180
truly we affirm that we are all willing

408
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:45,270
to give new tools and new instruments to

409
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:48,750
fight against climate change and the

410
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:51,180
last critical point for Europe even if

411
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:54,390
it is not an economic point is the

412
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:57,360
necessity to protect our borders because

413
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:00,570
we have to explain to our people that we

414
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,639
are a continent which is not open to all

415
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,800
the rest of the world we are a political

416
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,800
continent and there is no political

417
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,700
construction in the world history

418
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,609
Without Borders

419
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,460
and when there is a lack of borders it

420
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:17,309
is in the end of the European

421
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:21,139
construction and the end of any

422
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:24,178
political construction a last point

423
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:26,189
innovation innovation should be a driver

424
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,330
because I fully share your point of view

425
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,289
and your assessment

426
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:34,678
I don't want Europe to become a huge

427
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:37,350
Disney order and if we don't want Europe

428
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,529
to become a huge discount we have to

429
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:43,139
invest in innovation in new technologies

430
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:45,840
in disruptive technologies we have been

431
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:50,039
able to build Erebus we have been able

432
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,590
to build a lien and a leonis pass what

433
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:55,980
are now the new technological borders we

434
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,519
need to gather or funding to face the

435
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,999
challenges of artificial intelligence

436
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:05,399
space new technologies because if we

437
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:08,690
want to keep the technological

438
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:11,309
sovereignties we need to invest farm

439
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:15,149
do you agree chancellor I mean there's

440
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:17,908
none of those points are arguable it's

441
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:20,340
the methodology of getting there I think

442
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:25,889
this is important points and I do agree

443
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:27,178
very much but I would like to answer to

444
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:30,809
the question from a different

445
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:33,269
perspective yes I think we have to

446
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:36,779
understand how the process of European

447
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:38,730
integration worked so far so there was

448
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:41,009
in the beginning the attempt to do it

449
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:44,369
with political ideas for instance

450
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:46,049
forming a military Union of Europe this

451
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:49,499
stopped then because there was no

452
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:53,070
agreement and then we we started with

453
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:55,590
building the best single market of the

454
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:57,869
world and we succeeded more or less

455
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,158
there's still something to do especially

456
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:01,320
if we look at the financial and the

457
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,450
banking sector and there's a lot of

458
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:09,899
problems because it's quite difficult to

459
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:12,509
to build competitive big companies so I

460
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:15,959
think our idea about a competitive

461
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:17,999
market is more looking within the market

462
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,429
of Europe or the single countries but

463
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:21,750
not looking at global competitors so

464
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,630
that we have to form

465
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,120
companies of a size which could compete

466
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,580
big successful in the global market this

467
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,580
is in many questions something to be

468
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:35,669
discussed but in the end this is not the

469
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,500
main question the main question is that

470
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,660
we are now at a stage where we have to

471
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,080
discuss about political questions and

472
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:47,070
they are not could not be answered by

473
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:51,000
regulation by rules in court cases court

474
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,850
cases so I'm coming from a federal

475
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,110
country with a long history of federal

476
00:22:52,850 --> 00:23:02,719
tradition and I think you know remember

477
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:05,850
the history of the Holy Roman Empire of

478
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:11,550
German nation or something like that it

479
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:13,469
was all about rules courts and different

480
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:20,159
powers fighting against each other there

481
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:21,600
was not a common strategy and the city

482
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:27,780
of Hamburg I was the mayor of that city

483
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:33,389
state had cases at the court 450 years

484
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:36,030
or so and this should not be the model

485
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,580
for the European Union we should be a

486
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:41,520
bit more integrated and a bit more able

487
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,429
to define common political strategies

488
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,310
and so I think it's about foreign policy

489
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,930
I very much support the foreign minister

490
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:52,530
of Germany saying that we should have

491
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:54,030
not an animal anomalous vote and the

492
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,160
Council of the foreign ministers there

493
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,480
should be a majority vote for having a

494
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,400
common strategy we should cooperate in

495
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,160
building our defence infrastructure

496
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,730
which is meaning discussing about where

497
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,710
we buy our military instruments and if

498
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,820
you look compared the United States to

499
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:18,120
Europe they have 30 different ways of

500
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:22,669
military instruments weapons we have I

501
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:26,129
think approximately 180 it's absolutely

502
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:28,110
clear that no one can pay for it that it

503
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,780
will not work that there was a big

504
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,699
pressure on exporting these things to

505
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,800
the rest of the world without looking to

506
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,850
political questions because the market

507
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,489
is too

508
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:41,100
so I think now we are at the stage where

509
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:43,230
we should do that - from a common

510
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,090
approach of buying the things we are

511
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,659
need we need for our European defense

512
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:51,509
for instance we need a strategy on the

513
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:53,730
European borders which is not the border

514
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:56,159
between Germany and Austria which you

515
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:59,309
mentioned it is the border around of all

516
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,710
of us which my friend Bruno mentioned

517
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:03,928
and then we have which is the next

518
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,649
question a common responsibility for

519
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:10,230
those entering our European continent

520
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:11,969
and I think this is the lesson Austria

521
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,730
learned Germany learned the Netherlands

522
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,379
learned Sweden learnt mostly because if

523
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,519
you think you are right in the centre

524
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:22,859
and you have not a border to the outside

525
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,879
areas and what happens at the borders is

526
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:26,668
not your problem

527
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:29,519
it is a mistake and so I think all the

528
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:35,399
debates we had about refugees in 2015 16

529
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:38,460
17 started when we refused to be very

530
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:41,820
helpful when the first refugees came why

531
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:44,279
are the Strait of Gibraltar from the

532
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,850
North Africa to Spain and Portugal and

533
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,559
did not help them so now is the time to

534
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,988
show that we learned our lesson that

535
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:55,168
there is a common responsibility however

536
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:58,139
we will find a solution but we have to

537
00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:01,710
understand that thinking that this is

538
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:03,508
not bothering any one of us is a mistake

539
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,749
and this is the same with all the

540
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:09,149
questions of arbitrage with social

541
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:09,570
welfare instruments which should not

542
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:12,090
happen

543
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:14,639
arbitrage with regulation arbitrage with

544
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:17,488
the the way how we look at climate

545
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:20,459
questions in in industry or things like

546
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:26,489
like that so this is what we have to do

547
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:30,899
and to give and the end is when we

548
00:26:26,489 --> 00:26:32,700
understand that there is possibly a

549
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:35,189
world where we are still linked to the

550
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,639
United States because of common grounds

551
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:42,899
we have looking at democracy the rule of

552
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:45,090
law and things like that but that might

553
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:47,248
it might happen that the political

554
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,959
strategy in the United States is more to

555
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:52,049
look at the own interests

556
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,159
not looking who is the other friends on

557
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:59,190
the Democratic side it is necessary that

558
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:03,539
we build our Europe that it is sovereign

559
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:05,460
enough to be not pushed around and this

560
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,399
is the task the politician now

561
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,980
responsible have if we are not able to

562
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:15,360
face the challenges of a world of ten

563
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,580
billion inhabitants we will be in a very

564
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,699
difficult position but if we are able to

565
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,830
we must be not desperate about the

566
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,679
future of Europe we can be we have a

567
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,809
chance to be very successful optimism's

568
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,760
pretty much all around on this stage so

569
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:31,440
I do want to give you a heads up that I

570
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,059
would like to come to you for questions

571
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,350
we have a room full of experts so please

572
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:41,039
raise your hands when you're ready and

573
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:43,830
give us a name refrain from any comments

574
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,299
very short question to our panelists and

575
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,720
then we'll pick up the conversation from

576
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:50,340
there

577
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,990
sure hi I'm Erin gastic from IBM one of

578
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,668
the biggest advantages in the global

579
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,850
economy and this talk is about economic

580
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:57,690
future of Europe is technology and miss

581
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,279
youla Mary mentioned already

582
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:04,740
technological sovereignity I'm curious

583
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:07,590
to know from you is how do you think

584
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,990
Europe should be going about preserving

585
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:13,010
technological sovereignty and would be

586
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:17,630
the next steps for that okay thank you

587
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,629
I'd like I like that question because

588
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:24,149
I'm saying which I fully agree with him

589
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:27,630
it it's a shame that it takes us 12

590
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:30,510
months to decide on digital tax in

591
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,850
Europe because the Dutch don't want it

592
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,270
but I don't think it's the biggest

593
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:38,219
problem and I think I would like our

594
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,990
politicians actually to think about why

595
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,080
don't we have any large digital

596
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,750
companies before we think about taxation

597
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,770
of digital companies our problem is that

598
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:52,049
we don't have any major companies why do

599
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,809
the Americans have Amazon Facebook

600
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:58,770
Google and so on and why do the Chinese

601
00:28:54,809 --> 00:29:00,418
have Alibaba $0.10 and so on and why is

602
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:05,999
the biggest digital company

603
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:08,940
Europe ASAP this is the real issue that

604
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:10,590
we have why don't we have it why do we

605
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,230
do why do we not have the young

606
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,209
entrepreneurs like the Americans have

607
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,369
like the Chinese have that built

608
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,919
companies like that and part of the

609
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:22,439
reason why we don't have it is that we

610
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,529
are not even able to build a banking

611
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,499
Union and we are just light-years away

612
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:31,109
of be building a capital market Union

613
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:34,139
and that's gonna take another 50 years

614
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:36,359
what will happen until then but we're

615
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:38,719
thinking already about taxing a capital

616
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:42,149
market Union before we even have it and

617
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,059
this is the issue that we presently have

618
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:46,350
in Europe we should be an you mentioned

619
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:48,899
the fact that there could be another

620
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,879
financial crisis everybody's talking

621
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:53,248
about American banks having done a

622
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:56,969
better job than European banks I can

623
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:58,950
promise you the French the English the

624
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,009
German and the Austrian and the Slovak

625
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:05,330
bankers are by no means dumber than the

626
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:08,340
Americans our problem is that we finance

627
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:10,379
75% of the economy of Europe therefore

628
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,629
we are a big problem if something goes

629
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:15,359
wrong and the American banks finance

630
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:16,918
twenty-five of the American economy so

631
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,199
if they do something wrong

632
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:23,309
it's a small problem a smaller problem

633
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:27,739
for America so we have to think about on

634
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:31,379
how can we build together a market where

635
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:33,389
we can get young entrepreneurs to invest

636
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:35,699
where we get the money from them so that

637
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:37,498
we can have our European Amazon or

638
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,139
European Facebook and we don't have to

639
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:42,090
buy it from the Americans and please

640
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:44,609
let's talk about that that would be

641
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:49,830
wonderful if we start talking about that

642
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:50,730
I'd be really happy we see how hard

643
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,869
hardworking

644
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:58,879
working-class okay but I fully agree

645
00:30:54,869 --> 00:31:03,149
with with this purchase 75 percent of

646
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:06,109
credits rented by European banks and

647
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:06,109
there's a lag of

648
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,419
this is the capital market Union but we

649
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:15,379
are very far from also from from the new

650
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:18,929
technologies like like blockchain or

651
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:21,840
free crypto currencies assets just just

652
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:23,340
looking at this as a as a inevitable

653
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,158
future which is coming you know

654
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,738
so once I've been in in Asian forum this

655
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,049
this January so just to understand the

656
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:33,679
substance of discussion is you then

657
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:37,440
definitely you understand that we are

658
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:41,129
really we are lacking in that area and

659
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,710
just I would like to must fully agree

660
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:46,978
with with with Dino's manifesto because

661
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,659
Bruno presented manifesto today here and

662
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:51,479
I just would like to add maybe that

663
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:53,549
let's let's put several principles let's

664
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:56,339
put the European interest on on the top

665
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:59,549
of everything because now it's there is

666
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:03,359
a real threat real threat you can read

667
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:05,549
about our future and you know we have to

668
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:07,589
find out the the the protects our

669
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:10,789
respects because we have to find in

670
00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:13,559
every piece of Europe in mosaic

671
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:15,989
something which is bridges protecting

672
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:20,339
the respective national interest let's

673
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:22,469
cooperate closer and more effective just

674
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:24,960
you know and this is about the division

675
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:29,099
above the west and east which is here we

676
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,710
used to divide during the that crisis

677
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:34,649
about the North sounds but it's it's

678
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:36,629
this division between east and west on

679
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:39,658
migration issues for example just very

680
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:42,978
very Frank is here no so so just

681
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:47,729
cooperate closer and not to to focus on

682
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:50,789
on building of new walls which are also

683
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:52,469
here they are raising in Europe and what

684
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:54,419
I see as a politician is it most

685
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:56,219
important is that we have to deliver

686
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:58,379
deliver something which is

687
00:32:56,219 --> 00:33:00,839
understandable to the Europeans because

688
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:03,059
they must touch it they must feel it

689
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:05,369
they must see it because our language

690
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:07,469
sometimes it's really it's very

691
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:11,249
understandable to our waters to our

692
00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:13,469
people I agree with Peter but I think

693
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:16,889
that all the solutions will not come

694
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:20,400
from politicians responsibilities are

695
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:24,169
shared between politicians and

696
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,570
also CEOs of huge private companies and

697
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:30,450
small entrepreneurial I think and I

698
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:36,270
would like to say also that we can do

699
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:40,200
both digital taxation and European

700
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:42,930
digital Giants and both issues are

701
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,710
linked because when you have startups in

702
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:51,540
France or in Germany or in any other

703
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:56,010
member states small startups with the

704
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:59,010
level of Taxation 40 points beyond

705
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:02,090
Google Amazon and Facebook you don't

706
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:05,820
have the same chance of succeeding

707
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:08,520
that's why I'm so much advocating for a

708
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:11,279
decision on digital taxation on internet

709
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,639
giants by the end of this year and I'm

710
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,429
quite confident that we will be there's

711
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,100
also question there then of different

712
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:22,320
behaviour these startups would list out

713
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,239
a list of things that many questions

714
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,550
behind and to answer to the question

715
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,279
just raised first of all there is a lack

716
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:32,370
of capital we need capital if we want or

717
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,890
startup to scallop we need a more

718
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,770
integrated Union we need a capital

719
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:41,250
market Union we need a banking Union

720
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:44,040
because the size of the market is the

721
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:46,380
critical point so let's go this way of

722
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,750
having a common market an integrated

723
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,649
common market or banking union for the

724
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:56,790
sake of having a totally integrated

725
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:58,890
market with 450 consumers with the same

726
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:01,980
rules and then you will see that all

727
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:05,100
star tapas will be able to scale up

728
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:08,300
there is also a last question which is

729
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:12,150
the lack of cooperation among huge

730
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:16,160
private companies all over Europe let's

731
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:19,170
take the example of electric batteries

732
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,520
Germany is moving on on this critical

733
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:26,520
technique of electric batteries France

734
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,400
is moving on everybody is moving on on

735
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,920
its own track on its own way and we are

736
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,510
not able to find a better cooperation

737
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,320
among our private companies and I think

738
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:37,080
it's up to

739
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,720
or ruff and myself but also up to the

740
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:42,450
CEOs of those huge companies to find a

741
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,879
way of a better corporation otherwise we

742
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,129
will be able to rely on Chinese or

743
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,800
American technologies I'm gonna give the

744
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:52,470
Vice Chancellor the word since at some

745
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,570
point a lot of this comes back to you in

746
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:58,649
terms of the amount of agreement between

747
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:00,420
the two big hitters in the Ministry of

748
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,840
Finance's of the two countries that

749
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:06,120
matter right now I think we are on a

750
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,820
good track and I'm quite optimistic

751
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,400
about the question of banking Union and

752
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,200
capital market union because we defined

753
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,110
the agenda we know what we want to get

754
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,060
and most of the questions linked to the

755
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,420
banking union could be solved this year

756
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:24,150
and we know what could be the results we

757
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,820
make it made a proposal which is very

758
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:29,360
near to reality and we try to convince

759
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:35,180
anyone else and I think we will succeed

760
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:39,210
so just to come to the question and I

761
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:42,109
would like to give two answers the first

762
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:45,150
is yes we have to do something to have

763
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:48,960
really a single market in Boots

764
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:51,330
and certain questions and there is a lot

765
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,260
of differences which are not too big and

766
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:57,360
which could be soft and we should do so

767
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:00,630
so in in cases of information

768
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,790
technologies and digitalization I think

769
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,350
there is something still to do though

770
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,370
there have been made a big progress

771
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:09,360
because I think that the privacy

772
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:11,640
regulation we have from the European

773
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,730
Union is not just regulating the

774
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,910
questions it's also forming a common

775
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:20,190
market because this is giving a European

776
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:23,759
perspective to those dealing in that

777
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:25,770
field what we are to reach still is that

778
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,560
there is no arbitrage and governance

779
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,750
this is something we should accept

780
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,750
always that it is not nice

781
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,640
if a single authority is saying if you

782
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:38,010
go to my country we will not look that

783
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,629
strict to the rules and this is

784
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,150
something that could not happen in

785
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:44,130
Europe and it is our common case to

786
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,710
avoid things like that but there is

787
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,859
something to do and the second is

788
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:52,050
I would say mostly to the private sector

789
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:54,589
but we have to discuss it together and

790
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:58,920
to find a solution and it's mentioned

791
00:37:54,589 --> 00:38:04,200
80% of financing companies in the United

792
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:08,010
States is equity engine in Europe and

793
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,939
even in Germany it's 20% and this is a

794
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:14,609
mistake this is the biggest difficulty

795
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,950
for our competitiveness in the world yes

796
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:21,150
there is public money and we build a

797
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:24,240
funds we support startups we support

798
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:27,380
seed financing we support the growth

799
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:31,020
financing but this is modeling a

800
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:34,890
capitalist market with no capitalists so

801
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:38,190
I'm absolutely unhappy about the fact

802
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:40,500
that the money which is there in Europe

803
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:45,000
and the people that are willing to

804
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:47,869
invest money are not using the path

805
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,609
which is common in the United States and

806
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,680
this is not the answer of our tax

807
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:55,410
policies it's not the question of

808
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,270
regulation we can discuss them and we

809
00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:00,420
can solve them and we are all willing to

810
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:04,740
but if no one is willing to put his

811
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:07,050
money into a new company this is a

812
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,240
mistake let me give you a German as

813
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,880
successful in the end a successful

814
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,609
German example there is a company

815
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:19,200
founded in Hamburg as a startup called

816
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:24,569
my taxi which is the European legal

817
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:29,060
ubirr and it's really successful but you

818
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:32,609
were got billions from equity markets

819
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:34,049
without earning a single dollar or are

820
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:38,730
they on some money but not enough for

821
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:42,960
paying it back but so far this company

822
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:46,050
is earning money but it had the chance

823
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,810
to grow because at a certain stage the

824
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:53,250
German telecom invested and the second

825
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:55,200
stage daimler-benz did so but not 100

826
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,300
thousand of millionaires and

827
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,770
billionaires in Europe saying this is

828
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,900
the idea and if I joined this thing

829
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:05,320
and we give them five or six billion

830
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,840
monies they will compete ubirr and this

831
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,970
is what we have to change and if you

832
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,250
look at the big success stories of the

833
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,799
digital companies in the United States

834
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:18,790
if you look at Microsoft at the

835
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,590
beginning if you look at at Google if

836
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:25,570
you look at all the others which are now

837
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:28,210
named always Airbnb many of them had a

838
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,400
long time without earning enough money

839
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,350
for paying back what they got from the

840
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,300
capital market but there was trust that

841
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,610
this could be a good idea and there was

842
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,800
a certain way of entrepreneurship from

843
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,740
the financial market are you suggesting

844
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,280
that you're the European economy turn

845
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:48,939
itself into some sort of a mirror image

846
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,160
of the Americans in some way then

847
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:54,220
because this is a banking economy at the

848
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,049
end of the day versus a financial market

849
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,609
right I think we kind of mean and it's

850
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,530
that but this is just as this is

851
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:01,780
something you can say I think we need

852
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,420
more equity we need more money that is

853
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,730
invested into new ideas and growing

854
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,690
companies because there is an

855
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,600
enterpreneur

856
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:14,140
style in investment and this is not the

857
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:17,799
task of a bank a bank is not the one to

858
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:19,930
give a credit to someone without being

859
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,510
absolutely sure that they will get their

860
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,790
money back it must be something which is

861
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:27,040
equity financing this could be organized

862
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:29,259
by banks as well but it must be it's a

863
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,400
different task and a different story I'm

864
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,650
gonna give you a chance on a very short

865
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:37,540
rebuttal in a question from the front to

866
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:39,310
follow I just wonderful I mean this is a

867
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,610
German Minister of Finance says that

868
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:45,460
this is dream I'm really happy is a

869
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:48,700
dream for me it's the first time I heard

870
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,610
that huh because he said exactly the

871
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,580
right thing the the problem is what you

872
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:56,680
speak about is we need a capital market

873
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:59,200
culture in Europe we shouldn't go the

874
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,649
American Way but if one day we can go

875
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:06,250
5050 yeah Europe would be a great place

876
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:08,440
the problem is I do not believe that we

877
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:11,770
have a capital market culture and it

878
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,180
will be up to you and you to develop it

879
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,710
because that took

880
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,569
countries in Europe that have a capital

881
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:19,000
market culture one is Switzerland that

882
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:22,029
has never been in the EU and one is the

883
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,040
UK that's about to leave there is a

884
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:28,359
great responsibility if you do that I I

885
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,890
will for the first time in my life I

886
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:36,670
will only say nice things about

887
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:39,129
politicians I think what we are doing in

888
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:42,280
France trying to build a capital market

889
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:46,210
culture and when we are doing it so you

890
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:49,210
are being accused of making a policy for

891
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,839
rich people that's the key point that's

892
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,000
a problem

893
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,980
that's why a Christian Democrat or a

894
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,619
social democrat

895
00:42:52,980 --> 00:43:00,400
doesn't dare to mention the word capital

896
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:04,300
because we have to capitalize pension

897
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,400
funds pension funds it's the people we

898
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,859
in the Czech Republic in Slovakia we

899
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,630
have no capital market we get deposits

900
00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:13,808
and deposits and deposits on which we

901
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:15,490
pay our clients nothing if I could if I

902
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:18,339
could find a way on how can have the

903
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:20,589
Slovaks participate in the success of

904
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:23,650
the Slovak economy it would be wonderful

905
00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:25,720
well let's move to a question from the

906
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,920
front your name and a very short

907
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,319
question and who you're addressing it to

908
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,420
Milan usually it's a senior fellow my

909
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:33,549
certain Bratislava Slovakia I was very

910
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,619
much intrigued by mr. ministers

911
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:38,259
conditionality saying that if the United

912
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:41,109
States doesn't want to walk with us then

913
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,430
we should be more sovereign and I know

914
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:44,319
that this was a well manned

915
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,700
conditionality and of course when we are

916
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,650
in the mountains you understand that

917
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,200
it's better to climb in pairs than alone

918
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,390
and it's also costly to become a

919
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,578
sovereign but I'd like to push it a

920
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,470
little bit more and that is should we

921
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:57,880
become more sovereign because we need it

922
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,819
not because the United States doesn't

923
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,290
want to work with us should we become

924
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:09,520
more competitive because it's our

925
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:11,109
decision and we need to we should be

926
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,109
more competitive because it's our

927
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:16,509
decision we should be our more

928
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:18,940
successful because we develop the model

929
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:20,950
of a social welfare economy that is

930
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:24,490
successful on global markets which is I

931
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:26,710
think the European way of doing it we

932
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:29,709
are should be success will be

933
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:31,690
yes we understand that now learning that

934
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:34,000
it is about politics when we discuss

935
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:36,609
about the future of European Union and

936
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,380
it's not just regulation market and

937
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:41,470
things like that which are still

938
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:50,109
important but not the most important

939
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:53,410
questions but that I argued in the way I

940
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:55,420
did and you mentioned is I'm still very

941
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,700
much in favor of the common idea of

942
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,920
democracy and rule of law and the United

943
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,839
States our best friends who how else is

944
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,849
it and the people of the United States

945
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,359
are also and I'm a very transatlantic

946
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:09,490
politician so thinking about developing

947
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:15,690
the European Union is not just because

948
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:18,790
this might change and doing it is not

949
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:21,400
because we don't want to have but also

950
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:25,540
doing developing the European Union is

951
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,849
not a way of competing others it's what

952
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,800
we do for us ourselves but we are still

953
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:31,930
in an alliance with the United States

954
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,270
and we should not forget that this

955
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:36,910
worked quite well for a long time and

956
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:39,220
that we have common grounds and basis of

957
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:42,279
biggest importance for the future of the

958
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:44,259
world and I think that there is a good

959
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,440
chance that the American people are

960
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:50,080
looking at the things very similar as we

961
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,349
do Minister let me I I wanted to follow

962
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,299
up on that with a question what is your

963
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:59,349
perspective being when you have dealt

964
00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:03,280
with Washington when it comes to the

965
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:06,369
attitude the kind of belief that you can

966
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,310
have in talks and closed-door talks with

967
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:11,230
them and and when you look at them

968
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:13,930
strike deals with Canada and Mexico

969
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:16,540
after a lot of posturing is what's

970
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:20,589
happening with Europe similar to that or

971
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:22,990
do you see it escalating beyond control

972
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:25,270
and then coming back to the point that

973
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,618
we would have to be a little bit more

974
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:32,220
sovereign and a little bit more

975
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:38,470
self-reliant the US are of course our

976
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:40,390
closest allies and it will remain so but

977
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:46,750
I strongly believe that

978
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:53,589
Donald Trump is the best incentive for a

979
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:59,830
stronger Europe let's take three

980
00:46:53,590 --> 00:47:03,070
examples first of all trade black Trump

981
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:06,850
has decided to open trade war and he

982
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:09,310
thinks that he will win that trade war

983
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:12,480
I think that nobody will win the trade

984
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:16,570
war but together we have been able to

985
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:20,350
face the challenges posed by that

986
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:23,320
decision from Donald Trump and we had a

987
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:24,759
common reaction due to the Commission

988
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,040
and thank you

989
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,940
back at the stagger and thank you says

990
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:35,370
ya Moslem let's imagine that there will

991
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:38,260
not be any Europe and that every state

992
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:42,850
would have gone to Washington trying to

993
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:47,530
defend its case with Washington we would

994
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:50,080
have been destroyed and it was exactly

995
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:52,120
the contrary because we were together we

996
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,610
have been strong and we have been able

997
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:58,779
to face the decision of the natural and

998
00:47:54,610 --> 00:48:02,800
we have been able to obtain a change in

999
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:05,500
the decisions of Donald Trump so that's

1000
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,640
the first example that due to the not

1001
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:12,430
Trump Europe is stronger and is aware of

1002
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,910
the necessity of being stronger and more

1003
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:18,790
integrated second example

1004
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:21,460
extraterritorial sanctions we cannot

1005
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:24,370
accept to have that kind of attitude

1006
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:27,210
coming from Washington and France

1007
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:30,310
strongly refuses any kind of

1008
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:33,280
extraterritorial sanctions we are free

1009
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:36,340
to make trade with whatever state we

1010
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,620
want and it's not up to Washington or to

1011
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,440
the United States even if they are

1012
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:45,009
opposed arise to decide whether we are

1013
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,070
allowed to make trade with Iran and I'm

1014
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:50,320
deeply convinced that the outcome of

1015
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:55,229
that crisis with Iran will be the

1016
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:58,779
possibility for Europe to have its

1017
00:48:55,229 --> 00:49:01,538
independent financial institution so

1018
00:48:58,779 --> 00:49:06,390
that we will be able to make trade with

1019
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:11,529
whatever country we want third example

1020
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:16,420
the question of the relationship with

1021
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:20,829
China due to the attitude of Donald

1022
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:24,269
Trump I think that we will promote free

1023
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:27,460
trade we will promote new international

1024
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:30,160
institutions so that we will be in a

1025
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:33,069
situation to avoid a trade war between

1026
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,940
the US and China and we will also tackle

1027
00:49:33,069 --> 00:49:39,700
the key issues of intellectual property

1028
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:42,700
access to the Chinese market and so on

1029
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:45,999
so I think that we should seize this

1030
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:49,029
opportunity of the current US

1031
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:52,720
administration seize the opportunity of

1032
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:55,150
the aggressive attitude of Donald Trump

1033
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:59,319
to build a stronger Europe and to be

1034
00:49:55,150 --> 00:50:00,849
more independent mister you are stuck

1035
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:03,609
between a rock and a hard place in terms

1036
00:50:00,849 --> 00:50:05,440
of your economy and if this straight

1037
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:11,339
ball happens and take out the supply

1038
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:14,109
chain and if you see any benefits for

1039
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:16,328
Slovakia when it comes to trade with the

1040
00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:19,869
Chinese does it open a door does it help

1041
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:22,450
Europe and your economy to open a door

1042
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:25,479
into the Chinese market that possibly

1043
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:29,890
hasn't happened till now why you started

1044
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:32,799
now at the moment just I would like to

1045
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:35,279
mention on this USA you know then and

1046
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:38,650
this trade war with it a very humble

1047
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:42,640
mitigation to this potential conflict is

1048
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:46,989
that we just decided to buy new 14

1049
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,910
fighters from from USA you know and you

1050
00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:50,469
know as a responsible member of NATO we

1051
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,479
are going to increase we are going to

1052
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:55,660
double defense spending you know in

1053
00:50:52,479 --> 00:50:57,729
coming years and just I would like to

1054
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:01,690
raise this issue because you know you

1055
00:50:57,729 --> 00:51:05,710
should buy a Kafala you should be bought

1056
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,520
because we're cheaper and the the

1057
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:09,160
highest

1058
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,020
for money but but you know it's that's a

1059
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,790
really reality we are going to increase

1060
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:15,130
the defense spending and definitely no

1061
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:17,170
so-so and this is this is a thing

1062
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:20,260
opportunity for Europe you know because

1063
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:22,180
okay we are not pleased to to pump the

1064
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:25,300
Maumee money out of Europe I think it

1065
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:28,120
could be much better know to focus in

1066
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:30,670
Europe on our capacities that pesco is

1067
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:33,460
axle initiative in this area because we

1068
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:38,260
were again isolated in this in this in

1069
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:42,490
this world on this part of of spending

1070
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:45,160
and you know I will end with the Chinese

1071
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:47,379
but one breaks it for example in my

1072
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,240
country is in this is really slow

1073
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:52,030
products but a little bit we are

1074
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,740
benefiting from the brexit kiss I don't

1075
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:55,480
know if you know but in this countries

1076
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:59,470
we are going to launch the Jaguar Land

1077
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:02,560
Rover factory the plant they now our

1078
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:05,470
Indian British friends invested more

1079
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:07,930
than 1 billion pounds in this country is

1080
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:12,640
the first phase now we are working on

1081
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:16,779
the second phase they decided to do it

1082
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:18,790
before breakfast dear friend but we were

1083
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:22,810
a little bit afraid after outcome of

1084
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:26,320
BRICS referendum but the response from

1085
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:29,049
from headquarters in New Delhi from from

1086
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:32,380
Tata group and from from Birmingham was

1087
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:36,160
speed up please speed up the investment

1088
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:38,260
no so this is a you know do you see that

1089
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:45,819
this is a really different approach from

1090
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:49,770
from outside and on Chinese you know we

1091
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:52,630
see that this this wave of investment

1092
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:54,280
again my country is exception because we

1093
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:57,130
don't have a lot of investment from

1094
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,810
China other we should not throw

1095
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:03,100
countries I think they can be pleased

1096
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:04,360
much more but I think I'm not sorry for

1097
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:07,180
that you know because we are I think

1098
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:10,150
what what we need we need a high quality

1099
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:13,569
of investment not just cherry picking

1100
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:16,180
and and and and just investment with

1101
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:17,339
where the transparency of money is the

1102
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:20,038
problem

1103
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:22,469
a lot of issues so we need a kind of

1104
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:25,079
regulation in this area so so we are now

1105
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:27,210
know the tiger or leaders in this area

1106
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:28,799
and the trend investors I think that

1107
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,559
brings up the question since we're

1108
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:33,719
talking about brexit it brings up the

1109
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:36,599
question about banks we'll come back to

1110
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:39,059
banks we come back then to Italy and in

1111
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,190
the examples that we can have of the

1112
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:45,509
strengthening of the banking system

1113
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:49,259
itself I'm surprised that for about I'd

1114
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:51,450
say 45 minutes we haven't touched on one

1115
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:53,999
of the bigger concerns for the markets

1116
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:57,538
which would be not just a potential

1117
00:53:53,999 --> 00:54:00,450
trade war but also what's happening in

1118
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:03,779
Italy where do you all come down on

1119
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:06,450
brexit Italy as domestic issues because

1120
00:54:03,779 --> 00:54:09,239
they do reflect a little bit about the

1121
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:11,729
populism issues that we've seen really

1122
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:15,920
simmer I think we should be absolutely

1123
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:18,269
clear that there is in any country a

1124
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:22,410
responsibility for their own their own

1125
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:25,348
problems and this is not a scandal this

1126
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:29,339
is democracy so we should be aware that

1127
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:31,559
there is different elections and I would

1128
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:34,859
like to tell you Germany is consists out

1129
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:36,989
of 16 states with a long tradition more

1130
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:40,170
or less raising a lot of money having

1131
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:43,769
their own Texas doing most of these

1132
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:45,719
state business in our country and there

1133
00:54:43,769 --> 00:54:48,598
is a lot of different colors in the

1134
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:51,690
different governments and Germany and

1135
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:53,400
there is no not a crisis because there

1136
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:55,589
is a change in government in one of the

1137
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,259
countries and we have to deal with each

1138
00:54:55,589 --> 00:55:00,390
other and this is the same and I think

1139
00:54:58,259 --> 00:55:02,819
we could learn from that in the European

1140
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:08,640
Union if there is a change in government

1141
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:10,469
we should not be we absolutely discount

1142
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,210
we should not start discussing if this

1143
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:13,799
is a problem or not this will happen all

1144
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:17,279
the times and we will always have to

1145
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:20,190
deal with different men and women ruling

1146
00:55:17,279 --> 00:55:21,719
the countries and if it is democracies

1147
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,329
there will be changes as there were

1148
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:26,309
changes and so this is how we have it

1149
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:28,259
you're not worried at all that Italy is

1150
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:30,220
going to become another Greece because

1151
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:32,500
of course the stories are very

1152
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:34,750
it there is nothing like this which we

1153
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:38,109
could see I think the big story about

1154
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:40,540
how we tackled the crisis is that in the

1155
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:44,200
end we had the Irish Republic will have

1156
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:46,240
Portugal we have Spain we had Greece now

1157
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,029
anyone is out of the program but we were

1158
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:51,848
able to do this within the Euro

1159
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:53,890
countries which and and if you look at

1160
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:56,349
the small Greece it was the biggest

1161
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:58,779
program which ever was developed for a

1162
00:55:56,349 --> 00:56:00,970
single country in the world even the IMF

1163
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,730
never developed a program of this size

1164
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:06,640
so we are strong and we are able to help

1165
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:09,040
each other if there is a need to and the

1166
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,440
second is we made a lot of progress in

1167
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,800
forming banking Union capital market

1168
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,619
Union yes there is urgency for doing

1169
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:20,560
more and because of many reasons we are

1170
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:23,530
very hardworking especially the two of

1171
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:30,130
us or the three of us to get this but I

1172
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:32,020
think it is an Italian question and if

1173
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:34,240
you have a lot of debt you always have

1174
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:36,910
to be aware of the financial markets for

1175
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,220
financing your debt and this is one of

1176
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:41,950
the reasons why I recommend to my people

1177
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:44,740
that it is worthwhile that we increase

1178
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:48,879
the public debt during the crisis 2008 9

1179
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:51,669
and 10 to 80 percent of GDP and that we

1180
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,950
now decrease it down under 60% and that

1181
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:58,420
we will decrease it more because we need

1182
00:56:53,950 --> 00:57:02,080
the strength to be able to DD to act in

1183
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:04,540
a crisis without being having the need

1184
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,210
to ask others for help and to look what

1185
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:08,980
the markets will say or so and this is

1186
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:10,630
what we could recommend to others but

1187
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:14,050
it's their decision whether they will do

1188
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:19,839
so or not so I think Condon and when the

1189
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:21,400
new government arrived arose we said the

1190
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,920
president said they will stick to the

1191
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:26,170
European rules the mid Prime Minister

1192
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,760
said he will stick to European rules the

1193
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:30,099
foreign minister said he will stick to

1194
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,290
the European rooms the finance and

1195
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:34,960
economy and mr. sate said he would stick

1196
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:37,839
to the European rules and we have to

1197
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:40,270
take the words and not discuss if this

1198
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:43,450
might be so or so we will we will see so

1199
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:46,660
I'm not we are looking at it we are in

1200
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:48,640
this or our Europe it we are thinking

1201
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:50,950
about the future of Italy we hope the

1202
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,990
best for the Italian people because we

1203
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:54,640
like them and we are very happy to be

1204
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:56,680
together with them in our common

1205
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,600
European Union and now it's their

1206
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:02,259
government to take the right decisions

1207
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:04,150
looking at the brexit I will not say too

1208
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:08,460
much things because we are in the last

1209
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:12,760
stages of trying to get an agreement but

1210
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:15,640
I'm not we get an agreement I hope so

1211
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:22,860
and let let us be optimistic and such a

1212
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:25,930
nice sight but I think it was a mistake

1213
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:28,420
it's also a warning to all of us in the

1214
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:30,580
European Union because the big mistake

1215
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,040
that happened is the following the

1216
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:36,310
people were angry about globalization

1217
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:39,430
and they thought the European Union is

1218
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:41,980
the agent of globalization but it is

1219
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:44,350
possibly our answer to tackle the

1220
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,850
problems of globalization and this is

1221
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:49,060
something which we have to think about

1222
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:51,970
and it has to do with the problems we

1223
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:54,490
discussed before if we do not have

1224
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:58,450
political problems and stick to market

1225
00:58:54,490 --> 00:59:00,549
rules it will not be the answer for the

1226
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,919
people and then they think that this is

1227
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:04,540
a problem and so we have to change the

1228
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,820
way how we get progress in the European

1229
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:12,220
Union it must be more politics as it had

1230
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:14,170
been in the years before and since we

1231
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,490
try to get an agreement it's also the

1232
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,320
message we would to have a good

1233
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:21,430
neighborhood with the British people

1234
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:23,260
they are big friends but in the end it

1235
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:26,350
is the big task then too from the

1236
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:29,860
European Union even more strict as you

1237
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:33,009
might understand 85 percent of GDP will

1238
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:35,140
be produced in Euro afterwards this will

1239
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:38,710
have an impact we cannot account we

1240
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:41,650
cannot now reckon what it will be but it

1241
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:43,840
will be I I know we're running out of

1242
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:45,880
time and I know we have so many

1243
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,130
questions I have a whole diary for which

1244
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,870
I have not even gotten to but

1245
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:53,680
unfortunately we are running out of time

1246
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:56,380
so I do want to get the key points a

1247
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,040
minute each of you could of what you

1248
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,480
would like to

1249
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,730
see accomplished since we're talking

1250
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,160
about accomplishing something in the

1251
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:05,800
European Union in the next three to six

1252
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:09,700
months and rest what would you like to

1253
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:14,320
see actioned in in the face of all that

1254
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:17,169
we face well from my point of view it's

1255
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:21,270
very easy I think we have to get a break

1256
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:25,780
sit behind us in in hopefully a good way

1257
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:28,390
and we have to solve the Italian problem

1258
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:30,790
I think the language that is used from

1259
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:32,440
some of the politicians in Italy and

1260
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:35,110
also in other countries is just not

1261
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,480
appropriate anymore we have to tackle

1262
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:40,090
that issue and I quite frankly believe

1263
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,610
that this is an issue that will make the

1264
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:45,970
development of a banking Union in Europe

1265
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:48,850
more difficult because with that kind of

1266
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:51,430
government in Italy to form a common

1267
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:55,060
depository scheme is not making it

1268
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:57,790
easier for for the other countries so

1269
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,860
it's it this is very unfortunate but I'm

1270
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:02,529
walking out of here

1271
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:07,740
full of joy because I think one of the

1272
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:11,500
biggest issues for me is that we create

1273
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:15,069
a common a common capital market in

1274
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:17,260
Europe in which we all join to finally

1275
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:23,050
be able to beat the Chinese and the

1276
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:27,340
Americans I love that from my side I am

1277
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:29,770
the member of team of the eurozone so we

1278
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:32,380
would like to complete the banking Union

1279
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:34,540
and focusing on yes and back stove in

1280
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:36,670
ESM I think we can in the next three to

1281
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:38,759
six month go and for yes definitely so

1282
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:40,870
we're working that so I do hope before

1283
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,000
Christmas we can come together with

1284
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:44,920
Maris antenna will come and with all

1285
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,910
oven and you know they take we can

1286
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:51,520
celebrate all together this event with

1287
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:53,649
it is I it looks better filigree with

1288
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,090
interest it's going to be much much more

1289
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:57,700
difficult you know because there's a

1290
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:59,890
this is a level of trust about the

1291
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:02,859
depositors among the countries and it's

1292
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:05,589
it's really and any mpls and and all

1293
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:09,910
these issues are involved so this this

1294
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:10,660
is not the easiest way trade war really

1295
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:14,259
just to

1296
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:16,750
stay calm and to mitigate all possible

1297
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:19,119
and and don't to irritate the another

1298
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:23,230
weights you know of over and responses

1299
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:26,069
on that and digital text for us you know

1300
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:28,269
this is something which can be we know

1301
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:29,950
because we are talking a lot in Europe

1302
01:02:28,269 --> 01:02:32,279
we used to talk you know it's this is

1303
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:35,019
very nice to talk but we have to deliver

1304
01:02:32,279 --> 01:02:37,359
and this is something which can we can

1305
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:38,979
explain to the to the people that this

1306
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:42,549
is fair because we are talking about a

1307
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:44,200
fair taxation nothing this is not this

1308
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:47,319
is not we are not going to penalize

1309
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,640
these companies for their success or for

1310
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:52,240
something like that do you just want to

1311
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:54,640
fair taxation just on behalf of all

1312
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,890
taxpayers because you know I think this

1313
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,660
is that's it

1314
01:02:55,890 --> 01:03:00,069
my Chancellor what would you like to see

1315
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:05,170
accomplished in the next three to six

1316
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:07,480
months there's a long story I just will

1317
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:10,599
say I would like I would appreciate very

1318
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,460
much if the participation rate in the

1319
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:16,109
European elections would be very high

1320
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:20,259
because we try to form a democratic

1321
01:03:16,109 --> 01:03:25,900
building and it it needs the people to

1322
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:28,210
take the decision so many things one

1323
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:31,599
minute there seems to be completed I

1324
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:34,930
mean the brexit for instance there are

1325
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:38,890
things to be a delivered capital market

1326
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:42,970
Union digital taxation and are things to

1327
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:46,150
be launched I mean for instance a fund a

1328
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:48,598
common European fund for a disruptive

1329
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:52,539
innovation so that we can build on

1330
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:54,730
technological sovereignty and the dream

1331
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:58,630
behind that is exactly the same as yours

1332
01:03:54,730 --> 01:04:01,450
I want Europe to be an independent

1333
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:06,039
political and economic continent as

1334
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:09,519
strong as China and the US and I think

1335
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:11,380
that's feasible this is a man Vice

1336
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:13,479

1337

1338
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,259

1339
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:21,029
