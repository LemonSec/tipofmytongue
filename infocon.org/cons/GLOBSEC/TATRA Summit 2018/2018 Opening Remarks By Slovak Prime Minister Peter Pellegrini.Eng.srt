29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,919
challenging even has grown to become a

30
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:43,070
real landmark on the map of the

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,640
influential european conferences now

32
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,919
more than ever we need brand new ideas

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,729
to shape the world we need dialogue

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,979
between those who decide and those who

35
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,500
feel the consequences of those decisions

36
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:01,039
and the Tatra summit is the perfect

37
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,710
place for such a dialogue just take a

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,750
technology as an example it's

39
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,478

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,730
the way we create policies recently I

42
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:18,170
spoke to employees is one of our biggest

43
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:20,660
car producer and people are worried are

44
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,200
very worried and they asked me this kind

45
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:28,519
of questions will we lose our jobs if

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,440
robots replace us or or replay or they

47
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,480
will take our jobs in our factories or

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,660
what it means when we speak about

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,109
artificial intelligence and maybe

50
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,850
I saw some smile on your faces but we

51
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,820
need really to treat such questions

52
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,820
really serious we need to know the exit

53
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:51,109
implication of progress and be prepared

54
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:54,140
for them that is why 4x4 alike tetra

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,390
summit are important good ideas have

56
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,029
been born here in the past so we often

57
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:02,540
tend to say also today good idea

58
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,280
Slovakia to generate these new ideas and

59
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,730
solutions we also need advice and

60
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,840
expertise from abroad borrowing from the

61
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,670
Beatles with a little help of my friends

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,600
and one of these very good friends is

63
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:22,369

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,170

emphasis on digitalization and it's

71
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:43,130

I'm also glad that this conference has

82
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,959
no shortage of finance ministers they

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,510
are rich a great forum finance ministers

84
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,760
they are Austrian French and German

85
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,010
colleagues as well and we are truly

86
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,709
honored and I'm thankful to Peter

87
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:25,580
Casimir for attracting the creme de la

88
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,860
creme of echo fin today as we move to

89
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,890
discuss the pertinent topics of today

90
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,630
finance ministers should be the ones to

91
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,539
find the good and sustainable solutions

92
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,610
but not always because I know how

93
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,120
ministers of finance are dealing with

94
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,080
things

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,419
I had the chance to work with Peter for

96
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,280
two years as his deputy minister and I

97
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,900
don't know what they did to me they gave

98
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,198
me probably some special pill because

99
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:55,799
I'm very optimistic person and I'm very

100
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,210
helpful person but the two years which I

101
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,180
spent there I was completely other

102
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,150
person I was just cutting saying no to

103
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,690
everything and you know I I don't know

104
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,880
what happened but they know how to do it

105
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,789
but I have to say he's doing a great job

106
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,820
in Slovakia and really he introduced

107
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:17,370
only one day before I think the best

108
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,520
budget of Slovak Republic in our history

109
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,220
and we are really thankful that we have

110
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,180
already six or seven years at the

111
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:31,590
Minister of Finance

112
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:33,690
Peter but we have to continue and we

113
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,330
have to speak also about some other

114
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,930
figures and because this conference is

115
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:43,409
about numbers I would like to speak

116
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,870
about some numbers and figures of

117
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,520
Slovakia because Slovakia has been

118
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,460
exploring very favorable economic

119
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,620
performance with a real GDP per capita

120
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,219
growing at around 3 percent per year

121
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,080
over the past five years wages continue

122
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,690
to grow and investments have also picked

123
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,810
up the unemployment rate is at a

124
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,380
historical minimum of 5.5 percent and

125
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:11,099
the economic growth is predicted to hit

126
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,840
4.1 percent in 2018 also thanks to

127
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:15,539
investments in the public sector and

128
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,940
automotive industry in short Slovakia is

129
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,719
a common girl success story and I have

130
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:24,990
to say we are performing really well and

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:30,479
we I hope and I think we are living the

132
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:32,639
best times in our history since we start

133
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,570
to exist alone without double check

134
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,150
brothers 25 years ago but we know we do

135
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,190
not rest on our laurels however we

136
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,580
realize that our current economic model

137
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:47,219
is on its last legs and cannot take as

138
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,229
much more further coupled with the

139
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:52,120
ongoing digital transformation we are

140
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:55,240
aware of the need to change and evolve

141
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,490
a lot of work is ahead of us we aim for

142
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,380
nothing less than transformation of the

143
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:03,280
Slovak economy to respond to market

144
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,650
needs we seek to transform Slovakia into

145
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,989
a knowledge driven economy that can

146
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,820
adapt to the needs of this fast changing

147
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,380
world

148
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,599
let me entertain the topic of digital

149
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,780
transformation a little bit longer as it

150
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,850
is and rightfully so at the center stage

151
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,909
of what you are about to hear and

152
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,500
discuss for the next two days digital

153
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,360
transformation brings about both

154
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,280
opportunities as well as challenges

155
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,650
digitization produce new forms of

156
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,330
business models and markets the

157
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,690
potential to tackle multiple policy

158
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:40,659
objectives the ones is literally at our

159
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,270
fingertips with mobile apps intelligence

160
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,350
self learning algorithms and big data

161
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,729
and this potential is really endless

162
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,620
Slovakia follows an ambitious plan of

163
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:53,320
the European Union to boost its digital

164
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,449
and data economy on the national level

165
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,190
we are preparing the updated digital

166
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:59,440
strategy that will define particular

167
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,660
activities within the cross-cutting

168
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,310
sector of Digital Agenda most

169
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,110
importantly we want to leverage the

170
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,240
potential of innovative technologies

171
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:11,110
such as artificial intelligence

172
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,450
blockchain IOT and others it is obvious

173
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:17,590
that going digital for our economy and

174
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:20,469
society will have a vast impact on us

175
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,169
all as well we assume that growing data

176
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:26,650
sector can help to diversify our economy

177
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:29,198
which now heavily depends on automotive

178
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,529
industry if we succeed with our general

179
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,000
goal to establish new R&D centres and

180
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:36,370
expand existing business models we

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,229
believe that it will not only stop

182
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,000
outflow of the best graduates from the

183
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,479
country but it will also attract the

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,160
Slovaks leaving abroad and working for

185
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,500
high tech companies around the globe to

186
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,520
come back home again

187
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,680
moreover we need to prepare

188
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,439
systematically for the new multi-annual

189
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,020
financial framework as declared by the

190
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,670
Commission Digital Agenda will be one of

191
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,040
the top priorities when it comes to

192
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,560
funding based on the initial proposal

193
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,319
the chief funding program called digital

194
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,890
Europe will be established with the aim

195
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,540
to invest

196
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,550
billions of euros to align with

197
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,980
increasing digital challenges in

198
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,469
high-performance computing artificial

199
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,140
intelligence cybersecurity digital

200
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,750
skills and digital technologies

201
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,939
therefore we the politicians need to at

202
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,920
most the draft mindful project that will

203
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,459
boost research and development in order

204
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,260
to innovate for the benefits of all with

205
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:31,829
all these in mind we need to make sure

206
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,689
that the transformation benefits us all

207
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:37,510
ensuring that the big players don't

208
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,690
abuse market advantage and pay their

209
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,430
fair share of taxes that the SMEs and

210
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,519
also the most vulnerable parts of

211
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:47,199
society are not going to be left behind

212
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,089
all these need an active attention and

213
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,600
efforts of the governments in order to

214
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:54,790
drive the change in prosperous way it

215
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,380
should be our goal to save the

216
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,420
opportunities and transform the

217
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,180
challenges into further opportunities to

218
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:04,420
grow and for well-being of all parts of

219
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:07,329
our society Slovakia is the country with

220
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,490
the highest number of produced cars in

221
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:11,430
the world per capita and with a

222
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,720
significant share of renewable resources

223
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:18,279
has to keep pace with trends towards

224
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,579
exploding its innovation potential in

225
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,430
the automotive sector batteries both for

226
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,489
electro mobility and for energy storage

227
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:29,229
are the focus of the ongoing industrial

228
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,940
industrial revolution successful

229
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,790
production of powerful batteries is a

230
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,339
must but also our commitment in clean

231
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,819
energy as a Prime Minister I'm

232
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:41,260
supporting every good idea and

233
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,990
initiative to fulfill our international

234
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,569
commitments but also those proving that

235
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,480
Slovakia can be a good engine of the

236
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,490
Danube innovation Valley I am pleased

237
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,699
that we are all today witnessing the

238
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,500
launch of the Slovak battery alliance

239
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,479
which has just been inaugurated by

240
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,510
Commission's vice-president my reception

241
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,970
which vice president of the EBA my

242
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,730
colleague was in hoodak and our Deputy

243
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,610
Prime Minister Peter Casimir with

244
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,230
intention to develop an innovative

245
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,630
sustainable and competitive eco system

246
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:17,500
for the batteries industry alliance is a

247
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:19,329
newcomer in the Slovak scene let's wish

248
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,799
all the best

249
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:23,529
may bring ideas to all stakeholders

250
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,480
behind this project creating all these

251
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,749
opportunities requires effective and

252
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,739
efficient multilateral cooperation

253
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:32,019
that's why I welcome very much

254
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:34,989
initiatives like all we see these going

255
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:36,970
digital or numerous multidisciplinary

256
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:40,209
expert groups established by the

257
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:44,040
European Commission despite that rather

258
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:46,868
woloson we see today I remain optimistic

259
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,899
we see the mixed blessing of

260
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:52,600
digitization is in the transcends

261
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:54,610
national borders in the end nothing

262
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,379
short of a truly global solution will be

263
00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:02,139
enough and now let me stop here and I'm

264
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:05,170
saying really that I'm very happy to

265
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:08,559
recognize so many faces here in this

266
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:11,439
room I hope you will enjoy our beautiful

267
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:14,999
Slovakia you will not enjoy our

268
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:18,910
beautiful mountains you will enjoy this

269
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:20,949
great organized conference thank you to

270
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,738
you for organizing such an even because

271
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:26,769
it's really also about presentation of

272
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:29,019
our country I have to say and I will use

273
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:33,790
this opportunity because the second

274
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:35,799

and now I will leave this stage and

279

because I'm the Prime Minister I can

280
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:55,649
decide about my time and probably I will

281
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:58,350
come only in the night for the perfect

282
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:00,089
