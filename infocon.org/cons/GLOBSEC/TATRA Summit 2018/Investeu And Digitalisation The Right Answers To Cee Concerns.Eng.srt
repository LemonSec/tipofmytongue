1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,980
we have a great panel of guests today

2
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:16,660
with us to discuss these

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,689
especially within the context of the

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:23,980
next budget MFF also in plans for the

5
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:25,570
invest you financing structures the some

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,160
of our panelists actually directly will

7
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,619
help to manage in the future which

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,349
clearly will seek to leverage billions

9
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:36,040
in funds to finance projects across the

10
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:40,059
EU over the coming years so maybe I just

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,739
briefly introduce our panelists we have

12
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:42,968
Pablo Chavez who's immediately to my

13
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:44,290
left he's the vice president for global

14
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:47,620
public policy and government relations

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,570
at Google cloud he obviously has a big

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,150
stake in what happens to the Digital

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,920
Agenda in central Eastern Europe and I'm

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,860
sure can tell us about some interesting

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,390
studies and figures on what is needed

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,739
and the scale of the investment needed

21
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,530
in the future

22
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,360
we also have Shemesh Tov a sense key

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,850
who's a member of the management board

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,289
at BG k Bank in Warsaw it's a major

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,770
player in the management of the

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,869
impressed

27
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,960
EU fund in the future as well so he'll

28
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:19,210
have lots to talk about on that we also

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,818
have Vasily Hudak who's vice-president

30

of the European Investment Bank he

31
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:26,649
obviously has a great macro

32
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:28,089
understanding of not just transport and

33
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:31,149
ajeeb it just general infrastructure

34
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,889
financing generally and finally tomash

35
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:34,840

Development Bank who will also have a

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,509
big voice in how invest you funds are

38
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:42,520
mobilised in the future so gentlemen

39
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:45,249
thank you very much for joining us here

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,579
today for this discussion maybe I will

41
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:50,979
kick off by posing one simple question

42
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,770
to you and letting you riff on this for

43
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,899
a minute or two starting with you public

44
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,670
candid slow economy or candy digital

45
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,619
economy provide a new engine for growth

46
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:03,099
in central Eastern Europe and how can I

47
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,749
do this terrific well first of all thank

48
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:05,409
you very much for including Google on

49
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,149
this panel

50
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,920
you mentioned Big Ideas I also have very

51
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:10,300
big ears and they feel bigger with these

52
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,730
these things I don't know if you can

53
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,180
tell that they're pushing them out a

54
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:18,700
little bit self-conscious we are very

55
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,370
very bullish on the on the digital

56
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,670
economy in Central and Eastern Europe at

57
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,739
Google and from the specific perspective

58
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,000
that I that I focus on mostly which is

59
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:30,400
Google cloud

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,810
we are really looking at the region as

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,610
as a as potentially embracing new

62
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,720
technologies including artificial

63
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,940
intelligence within artificial

64
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,000
intelligence machine learning and and

65
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,550
and using that in order to bolster both

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,680
purely digital businesses but as well as

67
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,650
well as businesses that are in other

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,480
industries so agriculture manufacturing

69
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,300
and so forth all of them can really

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,280
benefit from digital transformation and

71
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,100
so when we've been looking at Central

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,770
and Eastern Europe we have this idea

73
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,380
that all of the growth that's happened

74
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,360
over the last several years we believe

75
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,130
that it will continue but we believe

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,790
also that it can be tremendously

77
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:15,400
enhanced by focusing on on digital and

78
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,859
in order to to maybe put a little bit of

79
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,740
rigor and analysis behind that that

80
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,230
belief we supported a study that is in

81
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,460
process right now by McKinsey and we

82
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,010
have some representatives from McKinsey

83
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:31,290
and in the room that is really focused

84
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:33,549
on the Cee region as the region of

85
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,929
challenging on the digital front

86
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,850
basically a region of digital

87
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:42,130
challengers and what we mean by that is

88
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:44,230
basically that as we see in labor color

89
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,230
and other factors that have that have

90
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,140
driven the regional economy today we

91
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,530
believe that that by infusing the

92
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,609
existing factors with digital we believe

93
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,890
that that can actually lead to

94
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,270
significant economic growth one of the

95
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,440
stats that came out of the McKinsey

96
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,270
study which by the way will be made

97
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,579
available later this month I think we

98
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,709
have a summary of an executive summary

99
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,700
about here in the room that one of my

100
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,080
colleagues can give you if you are

101
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,839
interested in in it

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,490
by 2025 we the the study indicates that

103
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,560
we could create about two hundred

104
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,980
billion two hundred two hundred billion

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,870
euros in GDP in the region that's the

106
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:24,190
equivalent of is essentially shakyas

107
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:27,760
economy or perhaps Portugal's economy

108
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,860
that's in the edition of that kind of

109
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,780
economic development in the region

110
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,580
through digital and more than happy to

111
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,409
talk a little bit about how we could

112
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,390
accomplish that but as an overview and

113
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,910
as a highlight that is what the report

114
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,229
indicates and and and it is one of the

115
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,730
reasons why we are

116
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,230
again tremendously bullish about this

117
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,630
region we really think that it is a

118
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,550
massive driver of economic growth

119
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,650
through digital both in Europe and

120
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,570
throughout the world

121
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,179
thanks Anne and Vasily maybe you can

122
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,330
also add in what exactly the eiv is

123
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,770
doing in his sphere if he's doing enough

124
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,080
I'll start as you mentioned it's more

125
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:07,120
macro macro view from the IB perspective

126
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:10,270
from European Luxembourg say they are

127
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,280
facing some really important gaps gaps

128
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,770
in terms of economic development and

129
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,539
structural gaps in the Indian economy I

130
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,210
have some numbers because I think

131
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:23,260
numbers they say quite a lot we did a

132
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:27,340
research research and we estimated that

133
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,560
the 27 because we are looking at 2019

134
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,840
you without you okay unfortunately but

135
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,530
that's that's the reality we estimate

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,799
that the so-called investment gap in 27

137
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,450
is around 400 billion euro this is 400

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,040
billion per year of investment which is

139
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,159
needed in different sectors of economy

140
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,900
just to be able to catch up with the

141
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,210
United States and with the growing parts

142
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,789
of the global economy and this includes

143
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:55,510
for example 155 billion to upgrade

144
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:58,090
energy networks 450 billion to transport

145
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,969
networks 50 billion for broadband data

146
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,739
center capacity and cyber security some

147
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,500
billion for climate change investments

148
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,200
and an additional and this is important

149
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,470
number 110 billion a year needs to be

150
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,659
invested in R&D just to again catch up

151
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,690
with the level of the investments in the

152
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,670
United States and China so the numbers

153
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,230
are huge also if you look at the

154
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,830
situation today with the technology

155
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:26,320
companies and my colleagues they have

156
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,419
interesting thing if you look at the

157
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,780
main technology companies which are

158
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:35,620
listed globally on the global stock

159
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,669
exchanges you have the big US group of

160
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,090
technology companies

161
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:43,690
so-called FAA and G's which is basically

162
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,929
Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix and our

163
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:51,550
Google Google friends and under half of

164
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,600
it and then you have in China its

165
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,300
so-called B 80s

166
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,610
Baidu Alibaba and $0.10

167
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,260
so these are world's largest firms and

168
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,070
their combined stock market

169
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:06,250
capitalization is around four trillion

170
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:09,190
US dollars which is a fifth of the u.s.

171
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,620
GDP and if you look at the European side

172
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,440
the highest valued European tech company

173
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,530
which is sa P is only the world's 60s

174
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,000
most valued tech company so you see a

175
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,070
huge discrepancy in terms of the

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,650
investment on the public side into

177
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,510
innovation into technology but also a

178
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,489
gap which is then reflected on the

179
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,289
private sector side where we see that

180
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,780
the technological and European

181
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,060
technological leaders are falling behind

182
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,429
now the question is what do we do about

183
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,250
that and how do we address this issue

184
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:42,910
also in Central Europe we believe that

185
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,130
one element has to be done is to push

186
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,860
more investments into this area

187
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,170
di b is one of the leaders at the

188
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,310
European level for example last year in

189
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:56,350
2017 where our level of investment

190
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,870
immunise was around 80 billion euro we

191
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,730
invested 14 billion into innovation type

192
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,360
of projects so it's quite a lot of money

193
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:06,310
which is going into the into the

194
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,190
European companies and European public

195
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:12,310
public sector projects which have strong

196
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,500
innovation element also we are managing

197
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,480
as you may know under the Younger plan

198
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,060
there is the European fund for strategic

199
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,130
investments which is pushing money into

200
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,370
more risky projects because they can

201
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:27,340
they can utilize so-called guarantee

202
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,100
provided by the local European budget

203
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,390
and AIB I'm glad that Gordon by now is

204
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,979
here who is actually a member of the

205
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,169
investment committee which is

206
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,479
independent of the ID and decides on the

207
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,459
allocation of the of the guarantees for

208
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,500
individual projects but I think in

209
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,720
Central Europe there are activities

210
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,580
which we are trying to promote and which

211
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,670
we believe bring will bring more

212
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,620
innovation and digitization into economy

213
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,270
one such area where we are working

214
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,090
closely for example is the Development

215
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,520
Bank's and we stammers and connect this

216
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,590
is the area of smart cities and smart

217
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,590
regions so basically how do you bring

218
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,200
technology and connect local technology

219
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,850
companies with local development with

220
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,019
local mayors with local cities and

221
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,489
regions

222
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,619
and creating this kind of bottom-up

223
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:16,569
innovation drive which I believe is very

224
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:18,339
important but also basically building on

225
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:20,410
the traditional economies which we have

226
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:22,540
in this countries like in so lucky it's

227
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,029
very much the car industry and yesterday

228
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,248
we had the launch of what we call Slovak

229
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,689
battery alliance which is also very how

230
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:31,749
to bring more innovation into

231
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:34,349
traditional sectors of economy but make

232
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:36,850
made them make them more very edit and

233
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,399
important from the region maybe lastly I

234
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,619
want to mention is that with all these

235
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,839
money all these efforts we cannot move

236
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:46,829
much further if we don't connect with

237
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,230
education and all our surveys show that

238
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:52,388
another important gap which is not so

239
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,569
much financial but of course connected

240
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:57,839
to money is the gap in skills of the

241
00:09:55,569 --> 00:10:00,670
labour force and unfortunately our

242
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,399
schools universities are still producing

243
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,769
students who are to large degree not

244
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,410
relevant for the for the needs of the

245
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:09,759
modern digital market economy so I think

246
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,759
this is important issue which we also

247
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,889
have to address thank you maybe if I

248
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,749
could just an established if you've had

249
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:19,059
the top-down view if you like from

250
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:21,339
Luxembourg the the big macro if you walk

251
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:24,279
in a National Development Bank do to

252
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:26,529
foster digitalization well to start out

253
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,869
thanks for the question I was about to

254
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,399
quote the same McKinsey study for two

255
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:33,089
reasons I'm a bit partial to the firm

256
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,799
first of all I used to work there but

257
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:37,720
second I actually think that you know

258
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,819
going beyond the first layer of things

259
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,230
is always a good idea and the digital

260
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,610
economy I really think we should go

261
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,399
beyond the very first layer and just

262
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,319
call it you know digital and that's it

263
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,639
rather three

264
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:51,128
I would I would rather propose three

265
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,660
kinds of differentiation one is which I

266
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:55,480
understand comes out from your study is

267
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,160
that well if you compare well we always

268
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,629
talk about the east-west divide in these

269
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,079
kind of things but if you actually

270
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:04,410
compare the GDP produced by digital

271
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,628
economy in the top five the biggest

272
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,429
Western European economies windows in

273
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:11,079
the centre in Eastern European part of

274
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:13,629
the world then you find that actually

275
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,609
bigger share a bigger share is produced

276
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:18,759
at the GDP in the C countries than in

277
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,829
the top five ones actually 6.5 percent

278
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,610
compared to five so not a huge

279
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:24,160
difference

280
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:27,100
actually larger barn where you really

281
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,899
find the legging is compared to the

282
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,100
frontrunner compared to countries like

283
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:35,380
Denmark or the Netherlands where 1012

284
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,269
even more percent of the GDP is already

285
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,670
due to the digital economy so there is

286
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:41,560
this kind of differentiation that we

287
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,790
have to keep in mind this partially

288
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,250
comes from leapfrogging

289
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:48,819
some of our economies actually started

290
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:51,160
to develop things after some developed

291
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,860
countries already developed them think

292
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,610
of one very specific and easy example

293
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:00,010
tall boots on motorways whoever drives

294
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:03,130
on the motorway in France Italy has to

295
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,959
stop or at least slow down very much at

296
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,089
those boots is now for example in

297
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,469
Hungary it's totally digital you don't

298
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,380
even have stickers anymore

299
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,660
it's fully digitalized because we

300
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,180
actually started to build motorways of

301
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:19,630
current quality later than anybody did

302
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,160
and in France or Italy so there is a

303
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,390
reason why this is a bit differentiated

304
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,370
then the other thing where it's

305
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,779
differentiated is well across Central

306
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,760
and Eastern Europe and there I have to

307
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,290
be a bit self-critical about Hungary for

308
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,360
example in each government we are very

309
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,819
much lagging behind the best ones eyes

310
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,500
Estonia and this is one of the things

311
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,420
that we want to concentrate on now and

312
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,250
in the coming years and the third level

313
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,979
of differentiation would be across

314
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,360
industries and I think that there it's

315
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,370
really important and that's where a

316
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,399
development bank can come in and their

317
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,290
investment gaps can be identified to

318
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,329
realize that well when you talk about

319
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,089
digital mostly you have things in mind

320
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:57,910
which you personally always use like

321
00:12:55,089 --> 00:13:00,100
digital banking however maybe the

322
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,519
biggest opportunities are in areas such

323
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:06,070
as agriculture or healthcare or actually

324
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,690
as I said E government and we would like

325
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,970
to actually find where these biggest

326
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,040
opportunities are in Hungary and in

327
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,560
Central and Eastern Europe thank you

328
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,990
Shammi Slava well what is the view from

329
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,290
Warsaw on these issues

330
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:22,449
welcome everybody thanks for letting me

331
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:26,890
present the perspective of Poland and

332
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:27,910
and educate on the initiative our

333
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,610
perspective

334
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,160
is very much focused on fostering the

335
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:37,720
cooperation in this central Eastern

336
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:40,140
European region and as far as the

337
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,500
direction of the investment that

338
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,510
president

339
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,480
Hudak mentioned the energy

340
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:51,510
infrastructure transportation we fully

341
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:56,260
in line with that but we think that

342
00:13:51,510 --> 00:14:00,930
where the biggest gap is is in the

343
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:04,360
Central European region were during the

344
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:07,739
second half of the 20th century we had a

345
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:11,350
big slowdown in the development and now

346
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:15,610
we need to catch up and and close the

347
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:22,030
gaps especially in the transportation

348
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:24,220
and an infrastructure going from north

349
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:30,209
to south or south to north

350
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,210
we have firmly well-developed east-west

351
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,790
the infrastructure as far as the the

352
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:41,500
energy and and and transportation it

353
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:45,459
goes but we also need to enable better

354
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,770
cooperation between the northern

355
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:54,190
countries in our region and the southern

356
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:59,710
countries that will link the those sub

357
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:02,530
regions effectively even though this is

358
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:08,160
the beginning we already have many

359
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:13,449
initiatives that are at least named

360
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:17,530
sometimes better designed like the a

361
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:21,700
carpaccio for example or the constant

362
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:23,980
saw the ice railroad thank you

363
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,510
thank you very much in and that actually

364
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,850
perfectly brought us on to what I wanted

365
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,770
to talk about next which was to open up

366
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,020
a little bit of a more fluid debate on

367
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,480
where money should go exactly what kind

368
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,010
of projects should be invested in of

369
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,140
course you mentioned of course via

370
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,139
capaci also energy links the LNG

371
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,670
terminals in

372
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:43,459
Poland and Croatian connecting them with

373
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,488
pipelines but I wonder on the digital

374
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:48,229
side to start off Pablo where do you

375
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:50,509
think money is needed most is it in

376
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,579
maybe smaller municipal projects is it

377
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:54,829
in improving cellular connection in

378
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:57,529
local areas where urgently needs money

379
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:59,868
to fostered utilization and guys do feel

380
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:01,249
free to jump in and interrupt each other

381
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:06,709
and fight a little bit to make it

382
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:09,559
exciting if well I would leave to the

383
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:12,138
experts too to give a sense of where you

384
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,629
know government money and other sources

385
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,279
of financing should should go you know

386
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:18,739
perhaps the the perspective that I could

387
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,549
add to this would be just to highlight a

388
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:22,790
couple of points that have been

389
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:25,069
previously made certainly education is

390
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:28,790
is critical and this is an issue that we

391
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:31,998
see globally it is you know it's not

392
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:35,149
simply the idea of improving education

393
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,970
but rather aligning education with the

394
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:40,819
needs of businesses both digital and

395
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,299
non-digital focusing significantly more

396
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:46,309
on skills you know one debate that that

397
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:47,629
I've been involved in and very very

398
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:49,610
familiar with in the United States is

399
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:52,699
this question about degrees versus

400
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:55,970
skills and whether you know a bachelor's

401
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:59,469
degree in political science is worth as

402
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,610
much or more or less than skills in

403
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:05,299
being able to program in a particular

404
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:07,849
language so so education focused perhaps

405
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:11,029
more on skills and perhaps more on the

406
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:13,458
needs of employers that we can find out

407
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,929
through data and entry tools in

408
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,299
connecting educational institutions to

409
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:20,539
employers that is an area perhaps of

410
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:22,418
investment secondly and this has been a

411
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:25,849
common theme at this conference

412
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:27,289
entrepreneurship there the investment in

413
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,899
entrepreneurship which might sound a

414
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:31,190
little bit strange but there is a way to

415
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:33,620
to promote that through educational

416
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,539
institutions through government you know

417
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,969
and more broadly through through society

418
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:40,010
one it's tremendously interesting

419
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:45,320
example that the that I've become aware

420
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:46,490
of here in Slovakia is the is there's a

421
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,460
company called Expo neo

422
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,950
Expo Nia's is is a startups digital

423
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,580
startup it's it's based in Bratislava it

424
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,669
is

425
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,379
essentially a micro multinational it has

426
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,870
offices throughout the world it's

427
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,169
supporting companies throughout the

428
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:05,120
world and it is really a company that

429
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,250
that is that is founded by a couple of

430
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,899
individuals who decided that they did

431
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,600
not want to work for the large companies

432
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:14,239
they wanted to build their own company

433
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,469
but they were very much driven by the

434
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,820
fact that they had digital skills and

435
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,370
the fact that they were that they were

436
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,470
very much entrepreneurs the third area

437
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,510
of investment and perhaps it's on

438
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,269
investment in perhaps it's more a point

439
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,610
of cooperation as you were saying before

440
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:30,590
is is for for the governments of Central

441
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,840
and Eastern Europe to unite around these

442
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,309
themes you know really there is an

443
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,330
opportunity you know when you think

444
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,250
about scale and you think about

445
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,158
platforms you have scale and you have

446
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,110
platform a platform here and in in the

447
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,880
region somebody mentioned before that if

448
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,678
you brought all the economies of Central

449
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,059
and Eastern Europe together you'd have

450
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,850
the twelfth largest economy in the world

451
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,379
what that is that is scale and and for

452
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,000
governments in the region to really kind

453
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,000
of think about how to perhaps

454
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,299
collaborate and cooperate more perhaps

455
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,299
around these issues of entrepreneurship

456
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:03,980
and education as well as enhancing a

457
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:07,158
true digital single market and other

458
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,480
policy areas that could also be an area

459
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:13,190
for for investment and in cooperation

460
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,169
thank you and Russell if this is

461
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,639
something that I think you brought up in

462
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:18,740
your introduction was the issue of

463
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:20,719
Education and research around this of

464
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,580
course the e the investi you program

465
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,929
would also focus money towards these

466
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,850
kind of initiatives but what is

467
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,919
happening now and how easy is it

468
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:32,000
directly fund education projects from

469
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,860
the EIB level I think when you look at

470
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,169
the correlation between the European

471
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,850
level and the national level in the

472
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:40,850
India we have to take into account that

473
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:44,959
the EU budget is only one percent of the

474
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,908
total GDP so it's not only small and

475
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,830
it's about two percent of the of the

476
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:51,110
public spending in the European Union so

477
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,178
really the main focus in the EU has to

478
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,969
be on the on the national public finance

479
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:57,950
and national national budgets of course

480
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,919
the European level of financing and the

481
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,870
EU budget can provide some some type of

482
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,590
incentives in the sectors which are

483
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,689
really

484
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,779
and then but also you bring kind of

485
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:12,679
European additional value into the into

486
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:14,480
the financing I think that overall and

487
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,520
as I mentioned the priorities on the

488
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,320
national level I think the government's

489
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,658
are responsible for creating a pro

490
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,570
innovation environment in their

491
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:25,580
countries and this is where you have to

492
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,460
talk about the education obviously you

493
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,220
have to talk about helping to develop

494
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,549
broadband connectivity you have to talk

495
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,500
about issues such as support for the

496
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:38,658
startups I remember when I was Minister

497
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,299
of Economy here in Slovakia we did a lot

498
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:43,909
of work for example on creating a legal

499
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:46,460
and financial environment for the Slovak

500
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,260
startups to be able to grow to make it

501
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,350
as easy and simple as possible to

502
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:53,629
register to get the financing to to be

503
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,428
able to grow and so on so these are some

504
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,799
of the steps which have to be done on

505
00:20:55,429 --> 00:21:00,980
the educational side for example we

506
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,889
introduced and is now moving forward is

507
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,890
the dual education vocational education

508
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,309
which means that students especially in

509
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,620
the secondary schools are able to go and

510
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:16,190
work in the industries in companies and

511
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:18,199
this also helps to to kind of bridge

512
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,120
this divide between the education which

513
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,610
may go outside of body what are the

514
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,539
needs of the market and the economy so I

515
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,850
think these are some of the measures

516
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:28,549
which which should be undertaken on the

517
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,860
governmental national level on the types

518
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:32,210
of financing where we see from the elbe

519
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,580
perspective I think this is felt

520
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,880
something on the national level and what

521
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,610
is needed in Europe is certainly the

522
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,179
equity financing for the innovative

523
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,770
companies maybe there is enough of

524
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:48,169
startup financing but what we are

525
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,710
lacking in Europe is financing for

526
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:51,830
scallops

527
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,059
so when startup grows usually what we

528
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,610
see in Europe is that many of these

529
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:57,889
companies innovative excellent companies

530
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,168
they then leave for the United States

531
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:04,580
for China for Israel etcetera because

532
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:06,799
there is no basically no access to the

533
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,799
type of financing which would be

534
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,200
available for for the scallops so what

535
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:15,320
we have developed in the Eid so-called

536
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,550
debt financing their equity financing

537
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,399
the kind of quasi equity

538
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:22,080
which which can help and support these

539
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,270
kind of scallops in their further

540
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,309
development so I think that these are

541
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,290
some of the initiatives which can be

542
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:30,240
done both from the European and the

543
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,360
national level and eventually they need

544
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,720
to complement to complement each other

545
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,370
and Thomas I want also to ask you about

546
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,620
an interesting initiative in in Hungary

547
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,559
is the inauguration of a test track for

548
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,120
autonomous vehicles hey I wonder how

549
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,790
successful do you think the country has

550
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,159
been so far in fostering these kind of

551
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,800
research hubs and of course retaining

552
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,290
talent then to work on self-driving car

553
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,100
system is lidar technology for detecting

554
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,870
passengers well what can your bank do

555
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,850
and how successful as a government being

556
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,669
in creating these these kind of research

557
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,860
hubs and centers thank you for the

558
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:10,320
question actually we have an interesting

559
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,000
situation where Hungary by the way a bit

560
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,330
similarly to Slovakia is talking very

561
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,760
much on the car industry 14% of the GDP

562
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:20,820
is produced by the car industry plus

563
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,610
some other related areas which is

564
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,169
obviously good from a specialization

565
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,830
specialization point of view but also a

566
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:32,340
risk if you look at the future of cars

567
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:35,040
so is that me okay it was a very

568
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:42,419
powerful voice yeah artificial you wants

569
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:45,020
it right unhappy that BMW is selected

570
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:48,360
[Laughter]

571
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:51,059
seriously the idea would be to look at

572
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,189
where cars are heading I mean literally

573
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,840
as well on the test drive but even more

574
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,800
importantly in terms of development and

575
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:01,439
it's quite quite obvious that e cars are

576
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:05,190
part of the future and part of the

577
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,840
self-driving development is also taking

578
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,940
place in Hungary especially with trucks

579
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,178
by the way not exactly personal cars but

580
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,860
rather trucks and this is one of the

581
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,350
things that yes we are we are we are

582
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,539
proud of and it's a it's an overbooked

583
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,799
test-drive

584
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,640
facility already although it hasn't

585
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,400
opened yet

586
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,650
so we think it was a good idea to build

587
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,200
it and this is a good example of how to

588
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,900
build on your strengths so to speak but

589
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,309
more generally I think that from a

590
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,980
Development Bank perspective and also

591
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:37,480
from a government perspective there is

592
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,870
also a question we digitized

593
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,210
digitization which goes back to the

594
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,270
point of how you basically when you

595
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,850
digitize usually outsource some tasks to

596
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:50,710
the customer I mean we don't like to

597
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,709
call it that way but I mean our bank

598
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,409
also introduced a landing procedure with

599
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,450
which is fully digital so the customer

600
00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:00,820
at home basically puts in all the data

601
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,250
and attaches all the documents that

602
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,860
normally the bank adviser would do now

603
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,210
the problem is and I guess there are

604
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,279
many in the room who already tried to

605
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,470
digitize some of their processes let's

606
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,620
first of all you have to completely dumb

607
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,600
down simplify and really you know

608
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,750
streamline your processes to be able to

609
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,320
digitize digitize it and then you

610
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,640
usually find that it's still not

611
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,129
understandable enough it's still not

612
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,070
used in a foolproof way it's still a lot

613
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,440
of times full of full of errors and

614
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,480
mistakes on the customer side why is

615
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,659
that partially because they are just not

616
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,640
educated enough in using the system in

617
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:42,820
using these kind of processes and

618
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,130
actually they feel alienated and if you

619
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,960
take this to the logical conclusion then

620
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:48,610
you will end up with people who are very

621
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,559
much at home in a digitized word and

622
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,330
people who are not and then they are

623
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,620
going to slowly be excluded from

624
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,629
services be it

625
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,850
eegh of ermand or commercial services so

626
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,470
I think keeping up the balance and

627
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,240
actually taking care of the education in

628
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,700
that sense is one of the key tasks or

629
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,970
for a Development Bank and and for for a

630
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:09,039
country as such thank you so much divert

631
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,200
ponen doesn't have such a huge car

632
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,539
industry compared to its it's Vishu file

633
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,100
really great for neighbors but look

634
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,840
there's clearly a big role that

635
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,490
digitalization is playing especially in

636
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,110
Warsaw can you speak a little bit about

637
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:23,480
what your bank is doing on these

638
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:26,959
projects yes

639
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,690
the relatively our car industry is not

640
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:34,960
as big as in Hungary and Slovakia but in

641
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:37,910
absolute terms is also not negligible I

642
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,540
started in the first round talking about

643
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:44,330
the big projects since Banco Scholastica

644
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:47,260
Vega is a development bank that supports

645
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:50,149
the government policies in in the

646
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,980
investment strategies investment

647
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:58,340
programs and obviously government likes

648
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:02,900
big big projects but in parallel we

649
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:06,050
would like to couple the this this

650
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:10,160
direction with supporting the segment

651
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:13,550
that president hudak already talked

652
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:17,510
about which is startups which is micro

653
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:20,300
small and medium companies today we use

654
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:22,750
the cohesion funds to support that

655
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:27,409
segment and in the future we would like

656
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:32,480
the invest you initiative to create the

657
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:37,360
environment for supporting that segment

658
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:44,930
because in Poland we see that as the

659
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:47,780
best way to grow domestic capital which

660
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:51,500
will then support further development of

661
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:53,420
the economy that was tough and also

662
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,610
bringing some perfectly to what I wanted

663
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,700
to talk about an expert vessel you just

664
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,350
want to mention that I think there are

665
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,540
growing evidences of countries of these

666
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:05,719
regional central Zandro Europe coming

667
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,600
together to support innovation and I'm

668
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,520
just looking at Ernst my friend that who

669
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,679
is working very much on on the idea of

670
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:16,070
so-called Danube tech Valley basically

671
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,780
how do you bring best minds and best

672
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,179
innovative companies in this area

673
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:24,590
ranging from Germany Austria

674
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:26,900
Sakia Hungary to Romania de facto how to

675
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,899
how you connect them how we bring them

676
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,310
together and to support also the growth

677
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,470
of innovative companies throughout the

678
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,950
region because they also need a scale in

679
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:38,980
terms of for the development

680
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:41,049
and another exam example very ideas was

681
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,120
also participating in cooperation with

682
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:45,639
the National Development Bank's in this

683
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,428
region in so-called Central Europe Ando

684
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,670
funds which is an equity fund where

685
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:54,460
countries like Hungary Slovakia Czech

686
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:58,540
Republic Slovenia Austria put their own

687
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:01,179
money me I'd be matching the this pool

688
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:08,889
and creating the factory fund overall I

689
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:11,380
think over 200 billion euro which next

690
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:14,080
year it's fair enough next year euro

691
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,940
which will be used primarily for for the

692
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,389
support of innovative companies in this

693
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,710
region from on the equity level so so

694
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,690
these are very good I think very very

695
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,890
good first initiatives where these

696
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,860
countries are actually coming together

697
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:29,080
understanding that they can have a

698
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:31,178
bigger piece of an or a small piece of

699
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,699
bigger pie whatever you call it but

700
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:35,500
basically creating a better space better

701
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,470
conditions for innovative innovative

702
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,650
companies in the countries to grow

703
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,290
Thanks

704
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:42,700
I I just want to move on to the MFF and

705
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,409
watch it up in the future and this was

706
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,450
something I think what have you have now

707
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,890
alluded to just for I do that anybody

708
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,630
got any questions for our panelists

709
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,630
about the topics we've discussed so far

710
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:56,530
anybody there

711
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,360
not yet which means we can go straight

712
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,100
on to the future so we've got the the

713
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,229
discussions in Brussels right now are

714
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,449
focusing on what to do about the next FF

715
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,830
but then also how to how to set up a

716
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,570
cohesion fund in the future is an

717
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,178
element of the connector Europe facility

718
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,370
there's also a lot of talk about how you

719
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:14,860
blend funds also how you leverage

720
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,809
synergies between sectors and create

721
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,909
energy and digital projects transport

722
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:20,590
digital project I wonder if what if you

723
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,510
could maybe give you a thoughts on what

724
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,889
do you think policy makers in Brussels

725
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,120
need to really consider right now is

726
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,850
they're putting the finishing touches to

727
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,350
these these proposals maybe Joe McIver

728
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:35,830
if we could start with you at that end

729
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:39,360
for for once well I think there is many

730
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:45,139
challenges that the policy makers in the

731
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:48,840
you are facing and the upcoming

732
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:55,380
perspective will be way more difficult

733
00:30:48,840 --> 00:31:00,570
than the previous two I actually don't

734
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:09,200
have a ready recommendation already

735
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:14,159
advise we rather look at it as sort of a

736
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:16,530
follow-on challenge for the member

737
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,110
countries and and Poland Poland will be

738
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:23,780
one with those that's why I mentioned

739
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:30,059
that what we have now which is

740
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:36,240
relatively large support from the

741
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:40,160
equation policy of the you may not come

742
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:45,710
in the same scale in the next

743
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:53,600
perspective so we seek many different

744
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:57,090
ways of closing this gap one of the

745
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:03,379
things that we are doing is we moving as

746
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:08,540
much as possible from grant model to

747
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:10,950
financial instruments so we already have

748
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,830
some success in this in the previous

749
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:17,400
perspective this perspective is even

750
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:20,870
more focused on on the financial

751
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:26,120
instruments so we expect to have

752
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:31,168
revolving money fueling the growth of

753
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:34,678
especially the SME segment but also in

754
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:38,970
the in the other parts of the economy as

755
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:41,850
well thanks Ian Thomas you of you it's

756
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:44,309
similar I would start with the idea of

757
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:45,928
centralized and decentralized funds in

758
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:49,678
to you because that's actually a key

759
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:51,660
point in in making the making any

760
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,809
recommendations about how how the future

761
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,260
should look like

762
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:58,539
the point is that now there are in the

763
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,309
structural funds already financial

764
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:03,070
instruments meaning money that has to be

765
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:06,730
repaid refundable loans or private

766
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,760
equity envelopes this is part of the

767
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,440
decentralized part of the funds whereas

768
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,590
there is a centralized part which is now

769
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,049
termed FC for short and which would be

770
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:19,860
replaced by investing you now our

771
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:21,879
experiences with the two sorts of funds

772
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,219
even though both our financial

773
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,590
instruments are very are very different

774
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:30,490
on the decentralized side Hungary

775
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:32,709
actually has the third highest rate of

776
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:35,409
financial instruments so repayable

777
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:40,590
refundable actually has to be repaid

778
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:43,000
kind of the fundable is a bit

779
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,629
technically correct but not not the

780
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,600
right term

781
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:50,019
so anyway of that that share is actually

782
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:53,500
8 percent compared to the total total

783
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:56,529
envelope which is higher than even the

784
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,570
average and the two other countries

785
00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:00,639
which are even higher are also see

786
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:03,850
countries this is the funds actually

787
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:07,209
that the bank that I'm managing NFB is

788
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:09,969
managing in Hungary it is quite a

789
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:12,460
success actually we've been through more

790
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:15,250
of the sources more of the funds then

791
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,500
than most EU countries 90% is already

792
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:20,469
used up compared to 44 which is the

793
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,940
average and also especially in the

794
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,279
private equity space which we've been

795
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:27,609
talking about compared talking about

796
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,179
startups we are I mean maybe even too

797
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,739
dominant

798
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:31,418
I'm happy that Commissioner first target

799
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:36,520
is not in the room anymore because last

800
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:38,408
year actually our funds were 99 o % of

801
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,659
the total venture capital investment in

802
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,669
Hungary which basically means that there

803
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:45,220
is no such market yet so we have to

804
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:47,319
build this market and so these funds

805
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:49,449
were these funds actually worth

806
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,980
they are big share of the total and they

807
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:53,649
are well placed in you can in the

808
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,570
economy on the other hand these were

809
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:58,750
decentralized funds on the other hand

810
00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:01,960
the centralized ones well we actually

811
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:05,280
didn't have any any FC project in

812
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:08,760
Hungary until last week

813
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,830
because we just signed a Thursday to be

814
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,130
very exact because Thursday so two days

815
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:18,420
ago we signed an agreement with AIB to

816
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:20,970
put to put 25 million euros into an SME

817
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,380
refinancing facility backed by FC

818
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:25,529
guarantees but until then we had zero

819
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:30,570
and more more seriously actually a total

820
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:34,470
region C as a region has a total of nine

821
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:36,300
nine percent of total FC spend so far in

822
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,040
this seven year budget cycle and we are

823
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,310
speaking about 13 countries out of the

824
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:44,550
28 so our experience with the centrally

825
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:47,009
managed FC fans is that it is mainly

826
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,810
spent on the big economies more than

827
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:52,350
sixty percent actually went to the top

828
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:53,820
five economies and that is a problem for

829
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,830
Central and Eastern Europe and we would

830
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,160
like to have an investor you which

831
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:01,049
actually makes these problems solvable

832
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,009
or actually tries to solve these

833
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:08,040
problems and at the very beginning thank

834
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,740
you and I so just to say that debate a

835
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,110
little bit this clearly been a an issue

836
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,970
of recent years probably for good

837
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,800
overall the structural funds have really

838
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:20,069
driven growth in parts of the EU

839
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,720
especially the newer member states how

840
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,700
do you think this is going to develop in

841
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,709
the future who could could this become a

842
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,000
problem as as time I said when it when

843
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,910
you have a situation where basically

844
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,650
public funding is being used for to

845
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:36,720
drive a whole industry is it

846
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:38,400
over-dependence i have a kind of mixed

847
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,169
feelings frankly about the structural

848
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,180
investment funds of the EU in these

849
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,120
countries as a one hand they have played

850
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,129
a very important role to to move this

851
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,440
country towards convergence and getting

852
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,780
closer to the levels of Western Europe

853
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,630
on the other hand I think there is a

854
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,740
negative element which is the fact that

855
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:59,910
these are certainly not market-based

856
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:03,810
through market based products and they

857
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,370
have created the certain mentality in in

858
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,259
these countries which is very much grant

859
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,490
based mentality so basically we take the

860
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,060
money we don't have to replay the money

861
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:15,419
and it's not always not always fresh and

862
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,710
always good so but basically looking at

863
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,849
this issue from the European perspective

864
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,359
you have

865
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:23,579
difficult situation post-2020 because as

866
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,038
in any budget you have to have a revenue

867
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:28,079
side and the expenditure side on the

868
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:31,019
revenue side you have less money because

869
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,529
of the brexit on the expenditure side

870
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:36,149
you have more needs more so-called

871
00:37:33,529 --> 00:37:38,219
priorities of the of the european union

872
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,989
because we have in addition to the

873
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:42,209
traditional ones like cohesion and

874
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:45,619
Common Agricultural Policy you have now

875
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:48,058
also European defence migration you have

876
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:49,890
environment or climate climate change

877
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:51,989
and so on so you have more things you

878
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:55,558
want to cover so the big question for

879
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:58,739
the European policymakers is how you do

880
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,420
more with less and that's the I think

881
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:03,839
the biggest dilemma for the for the

882
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,999
future you budget now how we do it on

883
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,819
one hand you have to cut somewhere so

884
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:11,519
there are cuts in cohesion policy and in

885
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:13,650
Common Agricultural Policy the the two

886
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,709
elements have been traditionally around

887
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,739
two thirds of the of the EU budget of

888
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:21,239
course cohesion countries are unhappy so

889
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:24,089
we hear from ministers from the cohesion

890
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:26,400
countries and regions this unhappiness

891
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:28,049
for central Central Europe it means

892
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,839
decreasing the cohesion funding

893
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:33,809
somewhere around plus minus 20 to 23

894
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,930
percent just quite a lot obviously and

895
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:41,579
as I said in the beginning there is a

896
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:43,948
certain addiction to stop money and and

897
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:46,859
on the other hand you need to somehow

898
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:49,140
compensate for this gap and the way the

899
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:50,788
Commission is trying to compensate is by

900
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,979
creating the so-called invest in you

901
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:54,839
pool of money which is the fact to the

902
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:56,848
financial instruments astonish explain

903
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:59,759
the money that has to be repaid or

904
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:03,749
should be repaid the invest in you is

905
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:05,519
very much modeled on the FC on the incra

906
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:08,308
plan on the European fund for strategic

907
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,379
investments where actually what we have

908
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:13,170
achieved is that with the amount of

909
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,630
guarantees for FC s or FC 1 which is 21

910
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:18,089
billion we have achieved an investment

911
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,910
impact in Europe of over 300 billion

912
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,069
euro so it's a huge leverage this is how

913
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,558
we can very efficiently use public

914
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:28,709
resources to actually get a big impact

915
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:29,800
in terms of investment and this is very

916
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:33,960
much thanks

917
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:36,280
to the fact that this type of money and

918
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,250
proper use of financial instruments can

919
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,240
leverage and engage private sector so

920
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,250
there is certainly more and more

921
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,620
realization that we have this big

922
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:47,200
investment gaps which cannot be filled

923
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,180
by public money nor national or nor

924
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,089
European and you have to engage a

925
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,770
private sector into this cooperation and

926
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:56,740
the only way how you can engage private

927
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:59,110
sector is by creating so-called bankable

928
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,850
projects or at least have pieces of

929
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:03,490
projects which are bankable where you

930
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,980
can blend some grant from the structural

931
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:07,750
investment funds and some portion from

932
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,940
the soccer financial instruments which

933
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,980
has to be repaid and this is now what

934
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,010
the big thing is about you know how do

935
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:18,220
we how do we structure this future

936
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:21,460
invest you who is eligible to use these

937
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:23,830
guarantees and obviously National

938
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:27,940
Development Bank's like MFP in in

939
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:30,040
Hungary or BGK in in Poland are getting

940
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,500
ready for the utilization of this pool

941
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,200
of money the AIB has traditionally been

942
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,820
in Europe the manager of the financial

943
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,129
instruments on this centralized level

944
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,050
but I think in general it creates a good

945
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,610
opportunity especially for private

946
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,390
sector to be engaged in these projects

947
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:48,370
because we will need to be much more

948
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:50,200
much more skillful and creative

949
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:52,960
including in developing projects which

950
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,480
have this commercial bankable repayable

951
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,580
element Thanks so anybody have any

952
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:01,180
questions on on the point raised to

953
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:09,100
comments on the points race so far yes

954
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:10,720
sir Jordan Bernie from Hungary I sit on

955
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,430
the FC investment committee and I wanted

956
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,290
to react on what tomash said about the

957
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:17,529
FC because I and I would like to see

958
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:19,410
much more Hungarian projects there and

959
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:24,400
my grandfather always told me in the

960
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:25,359
1970s that you know my uncle if I don't

961
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,740
play at the lottery

962
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:31,780
I usually don't win so the problem is

963
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:34,720
the FC investment committee I've been

964
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,790
there for one over a year almost one and

965
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,980
a half years I've only three three three

966
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,960
projects from Hungary coming in in the

967
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,660
infrastructure window was three first

968
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,040
supported the last one on Friday this

969
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,839
week

970
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,910
which is still not public which one it

971
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,710
is but only three projects for Poland we

972
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:53,040
keep a proving project every month

973
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:57,330
sometimes two or three in one session we

974
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,670
approved one yesterday as well so there

975
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:01,890
is a very strong difference between the

976
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:05,490
countries Bulgaria is the number four on

977
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:07,170
a GDP proportional drawdown of FC and

978
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,240
Bulgaria is not a more developed or

979
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,640
larger economy than Hungary so I think

980
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,950
there is a difference between the

981
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,170
activity of the given countries and here

982
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:18,089
the local presence of AIB and the

983
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,980
Development Bank's matters on generating

984
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:21,570
those projects and those projects can

985
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,550
come from the private sector and the

986
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:28,260
public sector what is a clear difference

987
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:30,480
is what I see is that in in Western

988
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,830
Europe more projects come from the

989
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,660
private sector in in for example hungry

990
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:38,940
the three projects we have proved one is

991
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:42,930
a quasi private sector the two are

992
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:45,450
publicly owned companies who received by

993
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:48,120
the way very large support we have also

994
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:50,790
on the other windows direct there are

995
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:55,500
already signed contracts with banks on

996
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:57,870
funding SME loans in Hungary for example

997
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,760
that was not mentioned so the FC I don't

998
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:02,100
think is biased for the larger economies

999
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,980
it's but there is certainly a factor to

1000
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:08,009
be taken into account that in certain

1001
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:11,030
Eastern Europe there are the structural

1002
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:14,610
funds which are a huge proportion of GDP

1003
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:17,880
related development around 3% of the GDP

1004
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:19,910
per annum so that's money for free and

1005
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,930
that's non-recourse money as you

1006
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:24,029
mentioned that's something that doesn't

1007
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:27,649
need to be repaid so that free money is

1008
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:30,600
also reducing projects that need

1009
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,390
recourse funding there is a crowding out

1010
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:38,250
impact of that as we expect in the new m

1011
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:40,170
FF that it is widely expected or

1012
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,630
forecasted that the structural funds the

1013
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:49,050
free money the grant money will reduce I

1014
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:51,180
expect that the demand for for recourse

1015
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:53,880
money ie landing and equity will

1016
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:57,299
increase in these countries as well but

1017
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,130
it is worse running already for

1018
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,440
FC projects now because you need to

1019
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,350
learn the methodology you know you need

1020
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,120
to learn to play the bureaucratic system

1021
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:10,370
so that when the demand is there you can

1022
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,370
use it efficiently Thanks

1023
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:23,300
well as I said nine percent was the

1024
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,250
total for Central and Eastern Europe and

1025
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:29,400
that's actually IB number so we can

1026
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:31,200
discuss country between country and a

1027
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,120
lot of projects from one country and not

1028
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,980
that many from another and the basic

1029
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,240
point is actually right obviously if you

1030
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,600
don't submit projects you don't get

1031
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,330
something but the total of the 13 in

1032
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:45,390
countries including Bulgaria including

1033
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:47,700
Poland is nine percent so there is still

1034
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:52,710
something wrong if this is the end

1035
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:54,180
result and that is also true for what

1036
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:58,650
you're saying about public and private

1037
00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:01,529
because well everything that we as a

1038
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:05,820
publicly owned institution can do is to

1039
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:08,430
directly leverage some incentives on the

1040
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,740
publicly owned ones and to try to get

1041
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,899
the private ones to actually submit

1042
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,000
projects and there another point is and

1043
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,760
actually that's leading to invest EU I

1044
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,240
think a very good idea to enlarge the

1045
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,060
technical assistance part of of this

1046
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,549
whole program because to be frank there

1047
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:28,890
is not much knowledge especially not in

1048
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:31,620
the dispersed private sector to submit

1049
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,680
the right projects and economies where

1050
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:36,210
there is more knowledge already

1051
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,700
accumulated throughout decades for that

1052
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:40,500
are obviously at an advantage and that's

1053
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,390
where we have that's what leads to the

1054
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,300
kind of situation we are in now we have

1055
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:48,330
seen show Misha if I could just ask you

1056
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,690
very very quickly to respond to this

1057
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,520
point

1058
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:52,560
why does Poland get a new road every

1059
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:57,680
week and hungry belly gets anything

1060
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,680
what's the secret lottery

1061
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:09,140
no no Poland is not covered by roads yet

1062
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:15,690
we have still forests and meadows and

1063
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:22,100
and beautiful nature we are really we

1064
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:23,310
have very efficient system of devising

1065
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,480
projects

1066
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:33,500
which then are submitted as for they for

1067
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:40,290
the EU support this is this is true we

1068
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:43,680
also have a very effective mechanisms

1069
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:45,300
for distributing the especially

1070
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,859
financial instruments and I'm talking

1071
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:55,430
about this because this is what I manage

1072
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:59,760
on the daily basis we really well

1073
00:46:55,430 --> 00:47:08,069
address the the the support to our to

1074
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:11,220
our companies and I think the reason is

1075
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:16,320
that we really care for this I mean it

1076
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:20,959
for us we coming out of communism we had

1077
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:23,310
literally no private the capital and

1078
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,170
still I don't I don't know what what's

1079
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:28,680
the structure of those projects is it

1080
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:32,040
are they originated from the public

1081
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:35,940
companies probably if private they those

1082
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:38,759
are not natively polish they they

1083
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:42,240
probably are some foreign investments in

1084
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,990
in Poland who have the capability to

1085
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:52,830
apply for for for big support for big

1086
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:57,240
portlets mentioned I think in Poland on

1087
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:59,069
one hand I think kind of genetically

1088
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,350
poles were always very entrepreneurial

1089
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,670
I remember when even during the

1090
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,020
socialist times you could see this

1091
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:06,780
Malucci

1092
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:09,020
and the Fiats Littlefield's driving all

1093
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:13,080
over Central Europe always carrying some

1094
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:16,140
big stuff on top of the of the Fiat sand

1095
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:19,710
and Paul sitting inside squeezed now you

1096
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:22,500
see them in inner-city assemblies and so

1097
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:27,090
on but anyway so I think that there is

1098
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:29,910
this very natural natural interest and

1099
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:32,790
an ability on the poorest idols on the

1100
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:34,740
corporate side to develop projects which

1101
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,509
are actually bankable you know where you

1102
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,459
can use financial instruments and where

1103
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:42,350
FC can be one of the sources of

1104
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:45,540
investment a second important you have

1105
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:49,110
strong strongly decentralized system and

1106
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:51,420
the boy roots to other regions or the

1107
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:53,880
cities are very active in developing

1108
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,560
projects which qualify for for FC

1109
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,930
guarantee so for some of their several

1110
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,630
projects in the Polish regions which are

1111
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:02,368
financed to FC like regional hospitals

1112
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:04,920
where actually the hospitals are

1113
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:08,130
modernized and built with the support of

1114
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,770
FC and their kind of balance sheet

1115
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:14,460
entities or some people be structures

1116
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:17,400
for for local regional infrastructure

1117
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:20,520
like in Krakov the bypass by President

1118
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,490
Clark ozone so I think Bob Pollin has

1119
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,320
really done a lot in this area

1120
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:26,609
thank you and Pablo just to pull you

1121
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,040
back into the conversation they have

1122
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:30,779
nothing to say about Big Sur yeah but

1123
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,490
you do have something to say I would

1124
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,460
imagine about the road of digitalization

1125
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:37,589
in this because the EU now is making a

1126
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,300
very very big push to make sure that

1127
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,280
however it calibrates the next budgetary

1128
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,280
period it creates lots of synergies so

1129
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,690
it specifically asks project backers to

1130
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,250
present them with projects that combine

1131
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:50,520
transport with digitalization

1132
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:51,990
initiatives and I just wonder from from

1133
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,000
the perspective from Washington is

1134
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,850
Europe ahead of the game on doing this

1135
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,460
is this is this a very future interested

1136
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:01,109
look at infrastructure instead of saying

1137
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,150
we need to build a road and then later

1138
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:06,029
will update it with connected car

1139
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:07,260
technology and sensors is what's the

1140
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,359
modern way of looking at funding

1141
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,730
infrastructure you know that that is the

1142
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,140
modern way of

1143
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:14,600
looking at funding infrastructure I

1144
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:17,930
think the more and more what we're

1145
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:19,640
seeing is the a couple of things one

1146
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:22,819
there's the the you know the physical

1147
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:24,770
infrastructure piece two there's the the

1148
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,660
aspect of preparing not just for you

1149
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,980
know in the case of building roads for

1150
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,390
you know the roads in the cars of today

1151
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,850
but the roads in the cards for tomorrow

1152
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,170
with sensors and so forth and this gets

1153
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:35,920
to the internet-of-things part of it

1154
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:38,900
then the third piece of it is is

1155
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:42,230
leveraging the data that that's coming

1156
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,970
out of you know both the use of these of

1157
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,890
this infrastructure and the

1158
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:48,560
infrastructure itself what we have found

1159
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:52,609
is is that there is a tremendous

1160
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:53,990
opportunity both in terms of of the use

1161
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:55,940
of infrastructure or even in the

1162
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:58,160
previous case of automobile

1163
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,680
manufacturing I mean the the amount of

1164
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,440
data that the factories in this region

1165
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:07,129
are the amount that it's that it's

1166
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,530
generating is really significant and it

1167
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:13,180
tells you a lot about the longevity of

1168
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:16,040
parts the efficiency of of manufacturing

1169
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:17,720
the the you know the the value of

1170
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,540
certain of different materials that go

1171
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,430
into the vehicles and it does really

1172
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,960
raise this question in terms of thinking

1173
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:26,569
about kind of the digital future of

1174
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,190
central in Eastern Europe you know how

1175
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:29,690
how the region really thinks of itself

1176
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,910
for example in the context of automobile

1177
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:34,520
manufacturing is is the competitive

1178
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:36,560
advantage one of labor costs as the

1179
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,680
competitive advantage one of logistics

1180
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,540
and perhaps the the question is also its

1181
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,960
the can the competitive advantage be one

1182
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,550
of Technology and of leveraging data in

1183
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,800
a building digital infrastructure around

1184
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:50,780
those factories we think that there's a

1185
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,090
tremendous amount of promise you know

1186
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,550
again not just for digital companies but

1187
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:56,720
for again manufacturing companies and

1188
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,619
other companies that can really leverage

1189
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,118
these tools and just as a final thing

1190
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:03,170
because I should remind everybody there

1191
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,420
is this McKinsey report that's coming

1192
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:07,700
out we have the executive summary of it

1193
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,560
that's available hopefully we can work

1194
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,540
together both with governments and with

1195
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,779
private sector stakeholders to turn

1196
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,670
those ideas into reality one point of

1197
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,430
the that the report makes is that the

1198
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:21,650
time is now and and there is a fair

1199
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:24,109
amount of urgency in taking advantage of

1200
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,940
the the digital promise so

1201
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,800
we would love to work with you and and

1202
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:29,360
we're looking forward to that thank you

1203
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,260
and just a very quick point as well

1204
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,440
going back to what we're talking about

1205
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:35,030
earlier in terms of Education

1206
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,440
specifically would Google cloud consider

1207
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,930
having more staff in the Central

1208
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,460
European region is there space for

1209
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,940
research clusters around universities

1210
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:46,010
and how do you view yes and for sure

1211
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,930
more we already do a number of those

1212
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:50,630
kinds of partnerships a lot of training

1213
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:54,589
a lot of support for for entrepreneurs

1214
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:56,090
and you know from a strictly the cloud

1215
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:58,580
perspective one thing that we found is

1216
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:00,710
that one of the challenges of cloud

1217
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:02,000
adoption and this is not just for

1218
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:05,750
Central and Eastern Europe its it's a

1219
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,060
global challenge is skills the the that

1220
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:10,670
that there is not enough knowledge

1221
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:13,310
within companies that are in other

1222
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:14,930
industries that are not yet digital in

1223
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:16,880
in the you kind of in the knowledge

1224
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:18,319
about like how to how to use these tools

1225
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,510
and how to leverage them to enhance

1226
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,160
business models so that's another area

1227
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:26,540
of Education that will be that will be

1228
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:28,819
focused on ok we quickly approaching the

1229
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,950
ten seconds left time but I want to ask

1230
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,260
you a one very very brief slightly

1231
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:35,000
cheeky question to conclude with if you

1232
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:38,530
had the the European Council in front of

1233
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,640
you now the 28 was 27 to 28 EU leaders

1234
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:41,930
looking ahead to how they should fund

1235
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,879
infrastructure in the future what would

1236
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,649
be the message that you that you think

1237
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,020
they should get on how to calibrate the

1238
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:51,080
next budgetary period for issues of

1239
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:53,930
infrastructure education etc maybe if I

1240
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,759
could ask Warsaw and Budapest then

1241
00:53:53,930 --> 00:54:01,790
Luxembourg and then the Washington

1242
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:09,530
perspective to close I'm not prepared to

1243
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:13,490
give advice I think it is important to

1244
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:16,790
maintain this dual approach that is that

1245
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:19,399
we have now which is cohesion so that

1246
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:24,340
the Europe becomes more similar there's

1247
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:29,870
the differences among the regions are

1248
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:32,810
reduced and the ideas like invest in you

1249
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:35,509
or younger plan were you

1250
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:40,040
rob is supported in the global

1251
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:42,170
competition Thank You Thomas well I

1252
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,770
would say something like please make

1253
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:48,440
sure there's a level playing field and

1254
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:52,570
if there is not yet one if there is not

1255
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:57,530
one yet then please work on creating one

1256
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:59,120
so I think that we have to make sure

1257
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:01,460
that there is more engagement of private

1258
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,900
sector in all these projects and I think

1259
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:05,450
that we have to make sure that the

1260
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:08,000
European money or national money public

1261
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:09,710
money creates opportunities for private

1262
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,050
sector to be engaged that's what we have

1263
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:15,230
to make them simpler easier to use and

1264
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:17,530
and and and create projects which would

1265
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:21,050
bring public and private together and

1266
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:23,920
Pablo to conclude I agree you know say

1267
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:26,480
I'm looking at a sign that says times up

1268
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,130
all right there you go if you join me in

1269
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:35,180
thanking our panelists will be great

1270
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:37,780
thank you very much gentlemen thank you

1271
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,779
everyone for coming
