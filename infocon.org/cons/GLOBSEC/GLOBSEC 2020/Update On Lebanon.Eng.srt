1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
related residential areas and this is

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,279
where the tragedy really

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,920
really was was visible and was

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,240
palpable because we also realized that

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,120
the area that was the most affected

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
is the area where you have beirut's most

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,400
creative people

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,119
those who meet on a daily basis to

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,799
design a country free of corruption

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,080
those who hang out in order to live

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,279
a life that is free from the

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,199
traditions and sectarian uh mentalities

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,280
in lebanon this is where these people

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,880
mingle and that part of beirut that

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,480
heart of a vibrant beirut

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,000
was the most severely hit so

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,959
what the current kind of going

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,519
theory on what caused this explosion is

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,600
nothing else and nothing more than

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,120
government incompetence and negligence

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,320
that seems to be

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,718
the most likely scenario even though

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,440
there still aren't real answers as to

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
what happened

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,879
because there hasn't been an

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,280
investigation uh there's

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,880
a big question mark about what kind of

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,400
investigation should take place some

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,158
people in lebanon are asking for an

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
international investigation

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,560
uh there is a sort of reluctance on the

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,399
part of the

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,080
authorities to have an international

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,320
investigation but we do know

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,158
that for example french experts but also

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,199
american fbi agents

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,240
um are in beirut uh kind of

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,280
checking out uh the scene

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,000
where on around you and where do you

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
think uh sort of what should happen

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
really

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
uh in terms of the investigation do you

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,640
think it's very important to figure out

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,079
exactly what happened

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,000
the problem that we are discussing

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,839
is a clear indicator of everything that

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,159
is wrong about lebanon the fact that

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,520
almost four weeks after such a major

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,479
blast that we still

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,119
don't have anything tangible on the side

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,880
of

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,399
the authorities absolutely no

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,640
accountability mechanism

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
absolutely no credible investigation

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,360
taking place

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
epitomizes everything that is wrong

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,600
about lebanon and makes us

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
understand how such a blast was even

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,959
possible in the first place

60
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,559
given the fact that we have authorities

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,760
who do not feel compelled

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,800
to uh hold anyone accountable who do not

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,120
feel compelled to

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,480
actually open their files and actually

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,879
reveal what they knew

66
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,879
in order to prevent the next tragedy the

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,760
problem in lebanon is that

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,319
a shipment of uh ammonium nitrate

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,160
reached

70
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,640
the port of beirut in very shady

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,160
circumstances not really knowing why

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,160
this particular ship left its route from

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,680
georgia to mozambique to actually come

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,879
to beirut

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,160
a lot of theories exist but absolutely

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,040
no clear answer

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,959
so this shipment arrived in 2013 it was

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,599
offloaded in 2014

79
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,120
in a way that doesn't respect any of the

80
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,359
international standards

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,120
it's been since 2014 that several

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,159
security and judiciary

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
bodies have been warning against uh the

84
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,959
danger of having

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,519
such warehouse

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,360
in beirut so close to residential areas

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,360
absolutely nothing was done

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,599
while dozens of authorities whether

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,599
ministers whether presidents

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,720
prime ministers knew about it and did

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,200
absolutely nothing

92
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,440
so i think we would be naive to believe

93
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,839
that they would be actually open now

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,519
to investigate in a free and independent

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,959
way and this is the only thing

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,920
that can actually bring some uh comfort

97
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
to the people who

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,679
lost everything to know what truly

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,440
happened and have

100
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,519
all the political covers all the

101
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,799
political shields that protect our

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,360
corrupt politicians

103
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,480
removed once and for all we owe that to

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,680
the 200 people who lost their lives

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,720
even before we delve into more uh detail

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,959
on you know what's going on

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,959
right now in beirut uh you know three

108
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,799
weeks and a half after the explosion but

109
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,480
also talk about the initiative that your

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,480
foundation has launched

111
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,000
i'd like to just take a step back widen

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,518
the the lens a bit

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,439
and sort of explain to those who are

114
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,439
listening to us you know why should they

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,439
care about lebanon it's a tiny country

116
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,040
there's like five million people there

117
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,000
it doesn't really have much natural

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,159
resources

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,159
there are bigger fish to fry more

120
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,358
important geopolitical uh

121
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,159
and security uh sort of problems uh

122
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,519
to think about and yet after the

123
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
explosion we saw

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,440
so much more international attention

125
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,280
being given to the small

126
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
piece of land french president emmanuel

127
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,758
macron was on the ground within 48 hours

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
but also david hale from the state

129
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,040
department was there

130
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,639
uh you know the iranian foreign minister

131
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
which was there

132
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,919
uh the qatari and saudi i mean every

133
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,000
almost everyone you can think of

134
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,758
canadian foreign ministers in beirut now

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,199
as well yes

136
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,600
so why why so much

137
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,759
i think we can of course have a very

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
narcissistic view about lebanon

139
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
uh lebanon-centric view of the world

140
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,479
it's unfortunately very common among

141
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,039
us lebanese everybody loves our food

142
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,320
everybody knows some of our musicians

143
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,120
and our actresses

144
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,479
but to be more security focused i think

145
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,880
lebanon is on the nexus

146
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,599
of three very major dynamics the first

147
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,919
one is the

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,280
self-evident one given the geographic

149
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,960
location of lebanon

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,198
and its proximity with so many

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,080
contentious points in the middle east

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,639
uh israel is on our southern border and

153
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,840
the

154
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,320
israeli israeli-arab conflict in general

155
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,039
israeli-palestinian conflict in

156
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,039
particular

157
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,159
haven't been resolved we're also the

158
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,639
neighbors of syria

159
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,759
which is at our northern northern and

160
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,919
eastern borders

161
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,120
and the conflict in syria also is

162
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,560
another symbol of

163
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,639
everything that is going wrong in

164
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,199
geopolitics these days around the world

165
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,720
it's a place for proxy war between so

166
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
many different powers iran

167
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,919
turkey but also very strong involvement

168
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,240
of russia

169
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,520
also the americans have presence on the

170
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,039
ground special forces

171
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,719
from many european countries are

172
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,039
operating on the syrian sphere

173
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,479
and lebanon is the country in the world

174
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,039
that has the highest

175
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,919
number of refugees per capita mostly

176
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,000
from syria

177
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,520
and we also know how sensitive the issue

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,199
of refugees are

179
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,880
is for for europe and the rest of the

180
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,160
world so this is the first element

181
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,919
the second element is that the issue of

182
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,000
managing diversity

183
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,280
in divided societies is becoming a

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,479
global discussion

185
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,719
it's true that it is not as security

186
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,520
problematic today as the conflict in

187
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
syria is

188
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,840
but we know how much the issue of

189
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,600
diversity of the coexistence of people

190
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,919
belonging to different ethnicities

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
to different religions can be a problem

192
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,919
not only in developing countries

193
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
it's something that is on a daily basis

194
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,159
uh providing

195
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,639
uh providing reason for political action

196
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,120
in europe in the united states in canada

197
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,120
northern ireland is an example the issue

198
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,639
of managing diversity is key

199
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,280
if in lebanon we fail at developing a

200
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,120
model

201
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
for a peaceful and intelligent

202
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,599
coexistence of people belonging to

203
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,520
different

204
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,120
backgrounds and culture it can have

205
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,919
repercussions beyond lebanon

206
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,319
and the third and major element is this

207
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,280
kind of new civic awakening that we see

208
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,680
among

209
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,039
young people all over the world young

210
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,680
people who do not feel

211
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,800
represented anymore by the traditional

212
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
political parties

213
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,759
who coalesce and act and advocate

214
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,840
outside party politics on the streets

215
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
it is happening also in lebanon and

216
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,318
similarly to many similar movements

217
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,758
around the world

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,680
it's not necessarily leading to

219
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
political change but it's also a

220
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,080
laboratory

221
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,240
for how young people organize uh

222
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,318
help each other advocate for political

223
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,360
change outside the traditional ways of

224
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,280
doing politics

225
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,759
and these voices these young voices and

226
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,080
i probably i'm close to some of them

227
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,599
have a strong resonance in other

228
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,080
countries in the west where

229
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,400
we studied in western universities so

230
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,719
we've also managed to develop networks

231
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,318
with people who today serve in the

232
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,639
administration of the eu

233
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,680
in the administration of france the uk

234
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,879
the united states

235
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,199
so this also adds a layer to the

236
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,240
proximity and to this focus on lebanon

237
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,879
that we feel every day and what about

238
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,199
sort of

239
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,360
great power competition just to bring it

240
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,440
down to to the lebanese

241
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,360
level do you feel like the current

242
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
political deadlock just so that people

243
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,560
who don't follow lebanon every day are

244
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,879
aware so

245
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,720
three weeks ago the explosion happened

246
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,319
about a week later the government

247
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
resigned a government that was already

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,319
extremely embattled because there were

249
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,520
protests as ayman was just referencing

250
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,360
since october

251
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,560
uh demanding a complete overhaul of the

252
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,560
political system

253
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,360
uh so this government has now resigned

254
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,760
and there doesn't seem to be any kind of

255
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,440
real solution on the horizon in terms of

256
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
forming a government that is

257
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,719
both response to the demands on the

258
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
street but also

259
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,959
is kind of conciliatory or allows the

260
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
traditional entrenched political parties

261
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,079
to also have a role

262
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,839
um and of course we can't talk about

263
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,959
lebanon without talking about

264
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,200
hezbollah and the the role it plays um

265
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,719
in in the political sphere because you

266
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,720
know perhaps foreigners know it

267
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,880
as a an armed group that you know is is

268
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,399
active in in many countries especially

269
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,800
in syria for example

270
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,920
um but it's also part of the political

271
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,680
uh sphere and

272
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,479
and uh you know sort of groups in

273
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,160
in lebanon uh but it has these real ties

274
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,839
to iran we're seeing the us

275
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,199
uh maximum security pressure uh play out

276
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,920
you know we're seeing france trying to

277
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,360
bring about an initiative and a way out

278
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,040
how much do you think the dynamics

279
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,800
outside of lebanon between these

280
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,640
countries are actually being

281
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,959
reflected in the current deadlock today

282
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,519
lebanese people always tend to think

283
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,880
that the entire world revolves around

284
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,200
lebanon in a certain way

285
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,399
or that all the actions related to

286
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,839
lebanon are

287
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,519
motivated by grander decisions i think

288
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,160
it is time for us lebanese to be more

289
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,440
modest

290
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,279
it is true that lebanon is tied to the

291
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,399
regional arena specifically to what is

292
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,320
happening with iran

293
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,480
what is happening between saudi arabia

294
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,880
and iran between

295
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,120
the united states and iran yes and

296
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,600
lebanon pays the price or benefits from

297
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
whatever

298
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,640
change happened at that level but at the

299
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,880
same time

300
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,800
it is time for us to listen carefully to

301
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,320
the message that was clearly sent by

302
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,079
by france help yourself to help you

303
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,399
and this is something that it is very

304
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,199
important for us to focus on today

305
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,240
we can blame iran and the united states

306
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
all we want

307
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,920
but this will not change the reality of

308
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,959
the lebanese people tomorrow

309
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,560
what we are fighting against today

310
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,599
is a political system that

311
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,920
is immune to any form of reform because

312
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,839
it contradicts its very essence

313
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,599
our political parties pretend to

314
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,760
represent the various sects

315
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
and and religious communities in the

316
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,880
country the fact that hezbollah is so

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,680
strong

318
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,120
is so armed and can impose whatever it

319
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
wants on the grand scheme of things in

320
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,320
lebanon

321
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,519
also provides a cover for other

322
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,480
sectarian parties

323
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,760
that oppose hezbollah to refuse any

324
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,000
change because they're saying

325
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,680
why should we reform while hezbollah is

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
still that strong and nothing can change

327
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,560
it

328
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,399
so we will maintain our corrupt politics

329
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,399
we will maintain our rhetoric saying

330
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,320
that we are protecting our community

331
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,680
because hezbollah is doing the same so

332
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,000
you have parties

333
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,760
regardless of their alliances that

334
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,839
actually perpetuate

335
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,240
an old way of doing politics that

336
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,480
prevent any kind of reform in addition

337
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
these political parties how do they get

338
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,760
funding

339
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,560
either by receiving money from foreign

340
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,240
sponsors

341
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,079
therefore they are not accountable to

342
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
the lebanese people and don't care about

343
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,079
reform

344
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,360
or they benefit from kickbacks and from

345
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,000
public procurement

346
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
so basically they steal government money

347
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
through

348
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,720
kickbacks and all different forms of

349
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,959
corruption in order to stay alive and

350
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,440
stay active as political parties

351
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,399
when we demand reform when the imf

352
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,160
demands reform

353
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,920
when every single friend of lebanon

354
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,760
outside lebanon demands reform

355
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,079
in order to help a country that is on

356
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,639
the verge of an economic collapse that

357
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,719
goes

358
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,480
above and beyond anything we've seen in

359
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,279
greece anything we've see we've seen in

360
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,680
venezuela

361
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,680
we have a political class that still

362
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,040
refuses to change anything

363
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,599
because it does not want to commit

364
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,000
suicide today the equation is clear

365
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
either the political class of lebanon

366
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,600
including hezbollah

367
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,560
and actually supported by hezbollah

368
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,279
maintains its way of doing politics

369
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,239
and if this happens the entire country

370
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,040
collapses

371
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,959
and this is a major geostrategic and

372
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,839
security problems for the region

373
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,239
and the rest of the world or finally

374
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
with

375
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
local pressure and international

376
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,399
pressure there is a certain opening

377
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,480
in the political sphere and to open the

378
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,040
way for a temporary

379
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,680
independent government of heavyweight

380
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,399
experts

381
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,000
who are who have good relations locally

382
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,200
including with the parties and the

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,680
international community

384
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,839
and who commit to at least some basic

385
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,959
reforms that would allow some oxygen

386
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,959
to come back to the country

387
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,760
um and so i want to actually uh

388
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,439
you know just to jump on that um

389
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,720
there's a a question that was just

390
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,480
suspen uh says uh submitted excuse me

391
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,079
uh that says it it's actually just a

392
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,680
follow-up on what amen was just saying

393
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,638
everybody likes dimension

394
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,079
and it's from andre matishak i hope i

395
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,839
didn't butcher your name

396
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,760
everybody likes to mention the words

397
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,360
lebanon and reforms in the same sentence

398
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,480
but ayman from your perspective what

399
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,279
kind of reforms

400
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,000
does lebanon need where to start and

401
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
what would be your

402
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,480
preference

403
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,839
first to stop stealing basic government

404
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,839
contracts that were funded

405
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,600
by the international community i'll give

406
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:50,000
you a simple example

407
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:53,120
there is a dam project water dam project

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
south southeast of beirut that is

409
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,000
decried by

410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,199
every single environmental expert

411
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,040
geologist with every single piece of

412
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,160
evidence that it would not

413
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,800
collect water it would not actually fit

414
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,680
with the

415
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,279
geology with the with the land we have

416
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,239
and at the same time would lead

417
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,040
to the destruction of wild forests in

418
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,279
lebanon

419
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,240
and this project has been funded or

420
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,720
there is a grant

421
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,160
from the world bank up to 600 million

422
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,399
dollars to fund it

423
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,920
up until this second the government of

424
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,519
lebanon the caretaker government of

425
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,920
lebanon insists on

426
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,680
maintaining this project where the

427
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,800
public works companies that will be

428
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,359
implementing it

429
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,160
are extremely tied to the politicians

430
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
who are

431
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,000
running the ministry of energy and water

432
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,120
and even the world bank is saying

433
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,760
actually we're okay

434
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,720
with lebanon not using the money there

435
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,199
and turning it for

436
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,120
things that are more uh urgent related

437
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,760
to covet 19 or to the bay report

438
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,839
explosion

439
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,959
and the lebanese government insists on

440
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,000
maintaining this

441
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,479
universally decried corrupt project so

442
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,560
first

443
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,480
stop stealing second element is

444
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,319
independence of the judiciary

445
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,000
as long as the lebanese judiciary

446
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,760
continues to be fully controlled

447
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,320
by the politicians there is no way

448
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,959
forward and the third major

449
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,560
reform is related to how we elect our

450
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,160
public officials i'm not

451
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,920
necessarily talking about a complete

452
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,319
overhaul of the political system

453
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,920
but some improvements to the electoral

454
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,399
code in order to reduce

455
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,920
gerrymandering and create a more leveled

456
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,560
playing field that would allow for a

457
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,319
fairer

458
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,279
competition these would be the three

459
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,959
entry points for reform in lebanon

460
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,120
and i'm sorry that's gonna have to be

461
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,560
our last point uh we tried to kind of

462
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,680
give you an overview of the

463
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,920
quite complex uh situation in lebanon

464
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,239
right now i hope you'll continue uh

465
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,240
following it and you will be able to

466
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
also kind of support lebanon however you

467
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,639
can if you are

468
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,560
able to thank you to ayman for

469
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,680
uh this very interesting chat and to all

470
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,079
of you for joining us

471
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,880
please stay tuned for the next session

472
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,040
titled

473
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:09,839
countering terrorism in virtual and

474
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:09,839
decentralized space

475
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,320
the central european jihadis are jihadis

476
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,800
without jihad

477
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,079
meaning they have no support of a jihadi

478
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,920
ecosystem

479
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,279
there are no jihadi veterans around

480
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,759
there are no recruiters

481
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,759
entrepreneurs there are no families with

482
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,839
histories of jihadi involvement either

483
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,839
and there are no radical mosques exist
