violent extremism

democracies

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,800

social and political

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,119
mobilization we all know that the

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,359
peaceful

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,599
defiance of the population had been

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
intensifying throughout the summer

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,359
and culminated with the mass

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,319
demonstrations

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,319
that were that followed the disputed

no

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,239
intentions of resigning anytime soon so

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,760
the question that is on everybody's mind

73
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,599
is what's next today even at our

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,518
conference belarus has come up

75
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,280
in pretty much all the previous

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
discussions which means that also

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,959
policymakers

78
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
and experts in europe and beyond are

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,920
trying to

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,079
wrangle their minds about what

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,079
approaches and responses we can jointly

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
develop to address the situation in the

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,200
country

84
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,319

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,399
first to you

86
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,399
could you please unwrap for us what is

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
currently being discussed in europe and

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:19,840
what is the

89
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,840
european response look like

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,518
thank you very much for for having me uh

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,518
elena

92
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,560
i am happy to to start by

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,519
saying that i'm sitting here only a few

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,519
meters from

95
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
the vents all in our foreign office

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,360
where tomorrow morning

97
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,560
the gimnich meeting of the european

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,760
union will convene

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,400
of course i can't tell you what these 27

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,640
foreign ministers and the higher

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,920
representative of the european union

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,000
for foreign policy will exactly discuss

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,000
but i will start by saying that the

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,200
european union has very

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,599
early on reacted to the

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,040
situation in belarus the foreign

107
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,560
ministers as we all know

108
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,120
met on the 14th of august and

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,840
it was a special european council on the

110
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,478
19th of august

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,680
with a very clear targeted message

112
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,199
namely saying that the european union

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,320
does not

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,919
recognize the result of the

115
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,199
rigid elections that we

116
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,560
have the intention to decide about

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,840
targeted sanctions

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,520
against those responsible for a

119
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,919
the rigging of the election and b

120
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,198
of the human rights violation and

121
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,320
violence against

122
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,639
demonstrations also we have urged for a

123
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,960
national dialogue between the government

124
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,120
and

125
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,400
the opposition in belarus and we have

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,639
announced more support for the

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,758
civil society in belarus and

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,039
now tomorrow i'm sure that this line

129
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:15,280
will be reaffirmed

130
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:18,479
we the foreign ministers will

131
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,320
make the point about where we stand

132
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,520
unfortunately we have to say that

133
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,599
the developments in belarus in

134
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,960
recent days have not been as positive as

135
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,840
one or the other may have hoped

136
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,799
namely the offer that was made by the

137
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,159
osce

138
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,360
to mediate in the conflict and to

139
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,520
organize kind of a national dialogue

140
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,720
between government and opposition has

141
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,039
not been picked up

142
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,320
at all by the authorities on the

143
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,960
contrary

144
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,599
the repression has continued maybe in

145
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,880
the more

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,960
smart in the smarter way so

147
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,440
we will have to assess the situation and

148
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,840
i'm sure targeted sanctions maybe

149
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,199
uh even a longer list than initially

150
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,119
planned will be

151
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,479
decided upon and the main thing is not

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,440
how many people exactly will be put on

153
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,400
such a list

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,520
but the main thing i guess is the

155
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,960
unanimity

156
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
and the decisiveness of the the european

157
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,840
union

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,080
to go ahead and i have optimism that we

159
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,679
will find this common line

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
and then that we implement these

161
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,880
measures

162
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,159
as quickly as possible i may

163
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,960
add that we would like to of course

164
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
discuss

165
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,120
possible sanctions lists with

166
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,400
our friends in the us in the uk canada

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,240
etc to

168
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,960
align them as much as possible

169
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,720
maybe i stop here responding to your

170
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,880
first question

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,840
thank you so much ambassador indeed this

172
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,080
unanimity is of crucial importance

173
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,000
to not just to find the common grounds

174
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
in the u but to send a very strong

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
message

176
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,280
and once you mention the american

177
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,560
friends i'm going to switch to

178
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,479
ambassador freed

179
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,680
and ask him a similar question about the

180
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,000
united states

181
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,360
ambassador fred many observers are

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,639
saying that

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,319
the yes is not particularly visible or

184
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,560
potentially slight somewhat

185
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,680
less visible that the european union in

186
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,759
its response

187
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,080
is it a prudent decision could you

188
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,400
please unwrap for us what's going on

189
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,318
and what is the thinking towards belarus

190
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,318
and if you would like to touch also on

191
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
the outcomes of the trip of the deputy

192
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,599
separator begun to

193
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,599
lithuania and moscow as well

194
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,080
well first i want to express

195
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,400
my agreement with the path ahead that

196
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,719
ambassador siebert outlined

197
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
i think that's the right approach i

198
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,960
think the united states

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,560
should work as closely as possible with

200
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,520
the european union

201
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,000
we should move in the same direction i

202
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,680
think

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,479
that speaking clearly and

204
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,479
imposing individual sanctions on the

205
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,758
russian officials responsible for the

206
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,039
rigged elections and the

207
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,440
repression is a good place to start i

208
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,318
think

209
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,479
that we ought to um and having in mind

210
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
what ambassador siebert said i think we

211
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,240
all

212
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,039
we also ought to prepare to support

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,520
bella russian society in the long term

214
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,680
because this will be a lot this could be

215
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,599
a longer term process we need to be

216
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,479
prepared for it

217
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,919
finally and this was the only thing that

218
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,399
ambassador siebert

219
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,640
um didn't mention i think that the

220
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,360
united states and europe should start

221
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,720
considering not implementing but

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,839
considering

223
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,600
uh contingency sanctions

224
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,880
against russia should putin

225
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,000
invade either directly or indirectly

226
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,760
i'm not saying we should actually do it

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,600
i don't think we should but i think we

228
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,439
should be prepared and we should let the

229
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,240
russians know that we are prepared to

230
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,160
act

231
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,800
as a way of deterring them from

232
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,439
intervention directly or indirectly

233
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,880
now i think the united states has

234
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,959
rhetorically

235
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,880
somewhat pulled back we have made

236
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,199
statements but the europeans have been

237
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
in the lead i think this is right

238
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,640
i think that our deputy secretary begins

239
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,680
trip

240
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,640
is well-timed he's going to the right

241
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
places

242
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,760
and he frankly is the right person to do

243
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,839
it i've known steve beagan for 25 years

244
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,000
he's respected by republicans and

245
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,800
democrats he's a serious

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
person who knows the issues he's there

247
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,240
with

248
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,560
the state department's george kent

249
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,800
deputy assistant secretary who's deeply

250
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,000
knowledgeable about these issues

251
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,839
uh he started off in vilnius meeting

252
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,040
with chihanovskaya as well as the

253
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,839
lithuanian

254
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,760
foreign minister um then to moscow we

255
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,519
had meetings yesterday he's going on to

256
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,160
kiev and then vienna

257
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:07,440
osce so i think supporting osc mediation

258
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,719
is a good idea look

259
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
this is an issue where the united states

260
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,200
and europe should be

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,920
at one and we should be active in the

262
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,480
short term

263
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,560
we should prepare for the long term and

264
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,240
we should not assume

265
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,719
that um the yellow russians

266
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,160
any more than ukrainians are going to be

267
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
satisfied

268
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,519
living under tyranny that is an

269
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,439
important message for us all

270
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,360
thank you so much ambassador also for

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,360
highlighting the importance of the

272
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,200
coordination between the european union

273
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,320
european countries united states but

274
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,880
also canada

275
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,160
and other democratic countries prime

276
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,079
minister builds uh

277
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,199
we had a set of measures that were

278
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,160
outlined by the

279
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,760
european union and the united states and

280
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,760
i think we all agree on the importance

281
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,240
of transatlantic cooperation

282
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,279
from your perspective do you think this

283
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,560
is a sufficient

284
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,320
set of measures uh that will result in

285
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,839
the change on the ground

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
or would you recommend that something

287
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,000
else should be done or should be done

288
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,000
differently

289
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,239
well thank you first we should recognize

290
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,640
that so far nothing has been done

291
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,680
except uh statements uh i think those

292
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,519
statements have

293
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,239
there were some some some in the very

294
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,720
beginning that were not uh particularly

295
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,160
uh perfect but but but otherwise i think

296
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,880
the eu line has firmed up

297
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,760
quite considerably um notably in the

298
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,240
last few days

299
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,399
and that's good what has been said from

300
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,440
the u side is that one is preparing

301
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,240
sanctions

302
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,600
uh and i think that was positive there

303
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
was some fear

304
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,399
in the beginning of this particular

305
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,920
debate that there would be perhaps one

306
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,240
member country who was

307
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
less keen on sanctions but it was good

308
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
at the first

309
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,200
video conference of the foreign

310
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,800
ministers that everyone agreed with that

311
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,160
then we should recognize and both

312
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,760
the ambassadors have underlined that

313
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,439
we were in for a fairly long game um

314
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,399
i think after the election lukashenko

315
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,399
expected to

316
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,560
get this over with fairly quickly as has

317
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,800
been the case in

318
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,359
after previous elections i mean a couple

319
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,279
of days of more or less heavy repression

320
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,639
and cutting down the internet and that

321
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,600
was going to be it

322
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,320
that failed um there were some people in

323
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,839
the west

324
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,680
perhaps who believed that there was

325
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,000
going to be a showcase moment

326
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,719
and lukashenko was going to fold and

327
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,079
leave for

328
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,120
turkey or russia or whatever um that did

329
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,279
not happen

330
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,160
we are in a stalemate situation at the

331
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,160
moment

332
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,839
where lukashenko is not really

333
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,079
controlling the country

334
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,160
and where the opposition is not

335
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,839
unseating the regime

336
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,199
this might break the one way or the

337
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,720
other that remains to be seen

338
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,320
but i think it's important that the

339
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,839
policy is designed to be a policy

340
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,959
step by step and for the long haul

341
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,399
as for sanctions uh i think it's

342
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:09,199
uh i always say that dan freed and i

343
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,200
have had many discussions on sanctions

344
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,079
sanctions are effective primarily when

345
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,720
you threaten to impose them

346
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,680
so we should threaten to impose them on

347
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,480
a fairly

348
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,439
large number of people but we can do it

349
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,839
rolling

350
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
you can easily start with one list and

351
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,040
when that is

352
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,638
implemented you say that if the

353
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,800
situation doesn't improve

354
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,000
we are working on a second list and a

355
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,120
third list

356
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,399
and and then you move in to the

357
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,600
different organs of power and and of the

358
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,240
regime

359
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,680
and um i mean i don't think asset freeze

360
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
is going to be particularly important

361
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,599
but but

362
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,880
but uh not being able to travel to

363
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,639
to the eu is important belarus fairly

364
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,439
unknown country to most people but it's

365
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,680
actually the

366
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,360
country in the world that has the

367
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,719
highest numbers of people

368
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,040
having shengen visas per capita

369
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,360
lots of people of belarus including the

370
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,360
regime and administration or whatever

371
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,639
they like to go shopping in vilnius in

372
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,760
other places

373
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,279
and to sort of gradually deprive

374
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,399
more and more people that we see

375
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,120
associated with or accepting repression

376
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,120
or falsification of election results

377
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,680
denying that possibility will over time

378
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,079
have

379
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,359
some effect so i think that's that's an

380
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,880
important instrument

381
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,519
then signaling to moscow is important

382
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,439
i think that has been done uh i think

383
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,279
the last few days have been slightly too

384
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,079
many people calling moscow

385
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,680
uh belarus the capital of belarus is

386
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,719
minsk not moscow

387
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,160
um but an element of signaling to to

388
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,320
moscow was of course

389
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,240
important and then we have the different

390
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,880
long-term

391
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
uh support civil society short and long

392
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
term

393
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,519
um i've been involved in a couple of

394
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,639
crisis with belarus

395
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,959
and then and we set in motion certain

396
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,800
programs x numbers of years ago

397
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,199
um and i can see some of them having had

398
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,479
fairly significant effect uh i don't

399
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,399
think it's appropriate to go into the

400
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,959
details of those particular programs

401
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,160
but their scope for expanding those

402
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,719
things further

403
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,399
uh without having press release on every

404
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,440
single detail of it

405
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,720
not expecting that to have an effect

406
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,279
tomorrow

407
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,360
uh not even the day after tomorrow but

408
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,880
the day after the day after tomorrow

409
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,360
and the transformation of belarus from

410
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,920
fairly backwards soviet society and a

411
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,880
very sort of backward soviet economy

412
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,800
to a modern european nation which will

413
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,279
happen over time

414
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,758
uh will take some time and we must be

415
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,959
able to pursue that policy

416
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,720
uh with persistence and and and

417
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,199
and with the long-term aim so

418
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,560
get the message out that yeah we will

419
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,040
not forget belarus

420
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,399
we will continue we'll stay the course

421
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,279
and our policy will

422
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,000
develop over time in accordance with

423
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,680
what we see

424
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,199
developments on the ground

425
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,880
in munich itself thank you so much

426
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,959
also for talking about the long-term

427
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,519
transformation in a way what we see now

428
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,839
this mobilization of society was the

429
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,959
outcome of the long-term transformation

430
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,000
of the country

431
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,079
that was not coming in

432
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,839
that wasn't necessarily visible from the

433
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,680
outside or even sometimes from the

434
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,360
inside but it's definitely

435
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,199
a very different society and a very

436
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,399
different country that we saw even a few

437
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,959
years ago

438
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,880
but um you mentioned an important issue

439
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,719
of the stalemate and i would like to go

440
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,199
back to ambassador zibert

441
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,759
uh and also on the issue of who calls

442
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,560
who

443
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,800
we know that for example yes a lot of

444
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,518
leaders are calling moscow and vladimir

445
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,120
putin

446
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,720
but we also know that uh and both sides

447
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,519
seem to be confirming it that for

448
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,680
example

449
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,800
um chancellor merkel did try to call

450
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,359
lukashenko

451
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,240
but alexander lukashenko refused to talk

452
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,439
to alex

453
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,079
to chancellor merkel so uh ambassadors

454
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,199
ebert

455
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,559
do you have ideas of how we can get out

456
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,600
of the stalemate

457
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,760
especially if there seems to be no

458
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,958
efficient and effective way to talk

459
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,480
directly to minsk

460
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,480
and encourage the dialogue

461
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,720
yeah one million dollar question um

462
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,280
you are right that that chancellor

463
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
merkel

464
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,600
tried to call lukashenko and i think the

465
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,399
fact that there are fewer contacts there

466
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,439
than in moscow is exactly for that

467
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,960
reason that

468
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:45,520
the responsiveness is so low in minsk

469
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,640
at the moment i i would like to

470
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,679
say that i i liked

471
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,559
the co co panelists saying that it will

472
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,720
probably be

473
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,879
a mid or long term game

474
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,480
i don't see a quick way out of the

475
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,440
stalemate right now

476
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,240
although the situation may be more

477
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,120
fluent

478
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,919
more in flux than we we think at the

479
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,000
moment

480
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,200
this has been going up and down over the

481
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,679
last two

482
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,400
two weeks but in recent days

483
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,320
the power of lukashenko seems to

484
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,400
stabilize

485
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,159
and he seems to apply smarter methods to

486
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,200
to control the situation

487
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,160
i think it is very difficult for

488
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,799
us in western countries to to really

489
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,080
exercise

490
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:42,400
leverage on the situation

491
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,439
because the those in power do not

492
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,480
very much respond we don't want to

493
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,360
uh openly come in on the side of the

494
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,880
opposition

495
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,799
because we believe that this is a

496
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,840
a below russian uh situation

497
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,840
and and hopefully dialogue it is

498
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,199
not comparable to uh kiev in 20

499
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:11,199
in 2013-14 people

500
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,679
are not talking about geopolitics

501
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,880
and where the country should go it is an

502
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,840
internal

503
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,000
discussion about the system of belarus

504
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,199
so we believe that we should

505
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,320
encourage a dialogue along the lines of

506
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,799
the of the current constitution

507
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,520
we offer help by the osce because this

508
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,080
is a

509
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,000
an organization belarus itself belongs

510
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,199
to and russia as well

511
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,240
so um this this will be the way forward

512
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,400
but we have to hope that with this very

513
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,840
deep

514
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,799
politicization of the society that has

515
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,559
seemingly suddenly happened over the

516
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,559
last weeks

517
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,440
the situation will never be the same

518
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,360
again as it has been before

519
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,520
we don't know how long president

520
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,240
lukashenko will stay in power we don't

521
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,520
know how long he will be supported by

522
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,520
moscow we

523
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,559
don't know whether the economy

524
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,120
will play an important role i mean

525
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,840
the fact that there are strikes uh if

526
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,039
they

527
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,959
will be prolonged it may be

528
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,480
an instrument to weaken the current

529
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,480
power

530
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,320
we don't know exactly about future

531
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,520
orientation of the

532
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,720
security organs the silhoue key who at

533
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,520
the moment seems

534
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,960
seem to be at the side of lukashenko

535
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,000
still

536
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,480
in the major part so

537
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,520
these are factors we we can hardly

538
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,720
influence

539
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,360
and we will have to be

540
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,000
smart in adjusting to the situation and

541
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,959
of course

542
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
claiming and

543
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:58,480
demanding that in belarus the

544
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,639
minimum human rights and

545
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,360
obligations that belarus subscribed

546
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,520
itself within the osce

547
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,360
should be maintained and and react

548
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,080
accordingly

549
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,799
so step by step approach absolutely this

550
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,879
will be a first round also tomorrow for

551
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,240
for instance for the sanctions and if

552
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,200
the situation goes

553
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,960
worse in minsk the eu i'm sure we'll be

554
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,000
prepared to step up and

555
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,000
take further action

556
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,200
and one more word maybe to ambassador

557
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,559
freed

558
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,360
on on the you are mentioning contingency

559
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,120
sanctions

560
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,639
discussion on russia not everybody in

561
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,039
europe is

562
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,000
is convinced of this method because we

563
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,200
believe

564
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,480
sanctions are interesting when they

565
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,840
are a targeted

566
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,320
be reversible in case of

567
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,760
the intended action is being taken by

568
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,720
the other side

569
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,520
and c when it is not premeditated and

570
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,720
discussed

571
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,799
because uh it should be it should not be

572
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,280
known what kind of sanctions might be

573
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,039
taken

574
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:12,240
at what stage because it makes us more

575
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:16,080
calculable in our actions

576
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,159
and and that is not what we want to

577
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,080
thank you very much ambassador um and i

578
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,080
will complicate what you're saying even

579
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
further and go back to this discussion

580
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,120
about

581
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,199
whether it's an internal issue or there

582
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,280
should be a discussion also with the

583
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,200
actors from the outside because we know

584
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,840
for example that

585
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,880
alexander lukashenko is actively framing

586
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,678
the

587
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,760
protesters as being financed and

588
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,679
directed from abroad

589
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,520
which of course puts the eu and the

590
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,280
united states in a very difficult

591
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,679
situation about

592
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,720
making any statements that are happening

593
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,159
in the country

594
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
and i wanted to connect it to the

595
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,080
discussion about sanctions and russia

596
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,960
uh our audience on the platform is also

597
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,039
wondering

598
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,799
and i will switch now to ambassador fred

599
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,280
because you mentioned about

600
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,280
the topic of sanctions on russia what is

601
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,158
the threshold on sanctions because of

602
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,158
course

603
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,280
you mentioned the outright military

604
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,840
intervention

605
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,080
which doesn't seem to be something that

606
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,720
is in the plans today but what does

607
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,080
seem to be already happening now at

608
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,840
least according to the

609
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,080
reports from the country that there's a

610
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,879
hybrid support from the russian

611
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,480
government

612
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,720
in the form for example of the

613
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,559
journalists that invited to help the

614
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,960
belarusian states run the

615
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,918
media npr campaigns and that's at least

616
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,679
something that we

617
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,039
even know officially from alexander

618
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,080
lukashenko himself

619
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,919
so ambassador fred uh would there be any

620
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,039
response or

621
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,240
any reaction diplomatic or public from

622
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,000
the united states

623
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,520
or the european union whether there

624
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,039
should be any response

625
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,840
about more subtle methods

626
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,960
of russian supports towards the

627
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,959
lukashenko government

628
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:08,720
well first i agree with both

629
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,760
carl built and michael seiberg

630
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,880
about the need for unity and the

631
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,158
need to think through our steps we're

632
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
not neutral in this

633
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,799
we have our principles that is we

634
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,880
the west should stand with the yellow

635
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,279
russian society

636
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,279
recognizing that um they are demanding

637
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,440
the right to be heard within their own

638
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:37,120
country

639
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,360
this is not about geopolitics

640
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,320
and we should not introduce that issue

641
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,199
nor should we draw lines on a map

642
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,960
and start ruling things out for the of

643
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,640
russian people that's up

644
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,799
that that's not what we should be

645
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,400
discussing now

646
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,000
at present to answer your question about

647
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,120
sanctions

648
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,919
we should move ahead promptly on the

649
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,080
individual sanctions against yellow

650
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,960
russian officials who have been involved

651
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,639
in repressions or election fraud

652
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,840
and it's a good idea to do it in

653
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,159
tranches as carl belt says

654
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,439
i hope the european union makes a quick

655
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,760
decision

656
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,360
and i hope that decision is not the last

657
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,320
one

658
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,199
with respect to russia it gets it

659
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,960
obviously

660
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,840
is a little trickier um

661
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,600
the united states and europe coordinated

662
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,000
its sanctions on russia

663
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,360
after russia's invasion of ukraine in

664
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,760
2014.

665
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,918
these included individual but also

666
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,960
broader economic so-called sectoral

667
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,240
sanctions

668
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,159
we did it they had an important impact

669
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,600
they limited putin's aggression in

670
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,720
ukraine

671
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,840
having done it for ukraine we should be

672
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,120
prepared

673
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,480
to consider it with respect to belarus

674
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,199
um not to actually launch these

675
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,919
sanctions

676
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,240
but to prepare them and in this i may

677
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,039
disagree with ambassador siebert

678
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,840
i think it is useful for the russians

679
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,600
for the russian authorities to know

680
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,918
that the united states and the european

681
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,199
union are prepared to take steps

682
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,760
we can't bluff what we do what we

683
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,279
say we're prepared to do if there they

684
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,120
invade

685
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,520
we should actually be willing to do

686
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,479
and i think having contingency sanctions

687
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,639
maybe not spelled out in precise detail

688
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,880
but spelled out with enough specificity

689
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,480
that so they know we're serious

690
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,799
can be a good idea um i think preparing

691
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,919
them

692
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:45,679
is useful um the threshold

693
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:48,559
well okay let's try to unpack this issue

694
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,679
if the russian army moves into belarus

695
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,840
that's one thing

696
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,840
but it's more likely that it would be a

697
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,799
combination of little green men and

698
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,439
russian

699
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,918
forces augmenting bella russian forces

700
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,039
or even

701
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,000
in belarusian uniform um

702
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,200
i in that more likely clay case we

703
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,840
should still prepare

704
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,440
to move we could impose individual

705
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,720
sanctions

706
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,360
against russians um for example

707
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,080
the propagandists who were taking over

708
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,879
uh

709
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:24,320
gila russian tv but i also think

710
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:28,720
that preparation for sectoral sanctions

711
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,360
on a contingency basis um can be useful

712
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
and it may be that we want to prepare

713
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,639
some

714
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,639
in the event the russians move in in a

715
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,760
hybrid fashion

716
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,520
um we should not

717
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,960
right now the united states and europe

718
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,279
ought to be talking about this

719
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,240
and coming up with a combined position

720
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,000
we're much

721
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,399
much better off if we're doing this

722
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,480
together and frankly as in a former

723
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,439
american official i'd rather do less

724
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,039
with europe

725
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,520
than more unilaterally um i think that

726
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,879
would be

727
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,120
a strong message of unity but let's face

728
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,799
it

729
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,799
sanctions are not going to be the

730
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,120
decisive issue

731
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,960
okay the decisive issue i think will be

732
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,879
the will of the belarusian people

733
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,559
over time and although this is not like

734
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,880
um ukraine in 2014 it's a little bit

735
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,879
like poland in august 1980

736
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,960
it's a little bit like the orange

737
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,080
revolution in ukraine

738
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:30,080
you know in in in o4

739
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,360
um and it's you know it's going to be

740
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,639
unfold according to its own logic and we

741
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,600
ought to be prepared

742
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,799
to help build a russian society in the

743
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,600
long term

744
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,520
carl biltz right we don't have to talk

745
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,799
about the specifics

746
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,000
but the united states and europe have

747
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,279
good experience supporting civil

748
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,360
activism

749
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:58,640
and free media and

750
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,120
we ought to we ought to to

751
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,559
to back to back up the people who are

752
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,520
risking a lot

753
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,760
uh on behalf of values which we all

754
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,760
share

755
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,320
thank you very much ambassador uh i know

756
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,918
prime minister bill that

757
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,600
uh you will have a lot to say about the

758
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,240
sanctions on russia and how to time them

759
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,399
properly

760
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,360
i would also want you to very briefly

761
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,239
touch uh

762
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,039
on the uh faith of the eastern

763
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,720
partnership

764
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,720
and belarusian membership in it from

765
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,200
your perspective how it could look like

766
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,039
but also about the a little bit unpacked

767
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,880
the support for civil society

768
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,799
ambassador free just mentioned the free

769
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,440
media we all know that the

770
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,960
for example radio free europe was one of

771
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,159
the very few sources

772
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,080
that could provide the uh

773
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,840
rather comprehensive coverage in belarus

774
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,799
of course together with belsat

775
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,480
both of the channels are functioning

776
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,440
from abroad

777
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,279
so if you have some thoughts on how best

778
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,799
structure the support for civil society

779
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,799
that would be very much appreciated

780
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,320
well a couple of comments on a couple of

781
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,320
issues uh

782
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,240
and i i certainly try to answer those as

783
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,960
well but um

784
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,720
calling means co-calling moscow yeah i

785
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,480
mean talking lukashenko yeah

786
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,559
sort of he didn't take the call of

787
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,760
angela merkel but

788
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,879
not quite certainly would have been that

789
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,840
useful but uh

790
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,720
called the foreign minister um foreign

791
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,000
minister mckay

792
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,360
wrote a letter to the eu foreign

793
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
minister i think every u.s foreign

794
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,000
minister

795
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,279
should call him and say hi what are you

796
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,120
up to uh

797
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,559
call the prime minister he's a new guy i

798
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,600
haven't a clue who he is he

799
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,158
came in in june uh but we

800
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,480
we should sort of call all of those

801
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,200
officials that are reachable

802
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,720
so that they understand the message and

803
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,320
understand that this is not

804
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,640
going to go away i think that's

805
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,720
important on the

806
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,720
uh sanctions belarus yeah i think we

807
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,080
agree this sort of step by step

808
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,080
and i think it's very important that the

809
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,399
eu should sort of announce that

810
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,519
one is prepared to do more not if the

811
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,039
things deteriorate

812
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:07,519
but also if it doesn't improve

813
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,720
so that we until we see an improvement

814
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,919
are prepared to

815
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,600
step up each step can be fairly small

816
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,679
but the fact that it's seen as a

817
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,320
long-term thing and no one

818
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,519
in belarus can be fairly certain if

819
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,320
they're going to be on the list

820
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,799
tomorrow uh and that's the important

821
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,200
thing

822
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,960
the fear factor that they will be on the

823
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,880
list once on the list

824
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,840
it's another issue on on other sanctions

825
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,840
belarus

826
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,640
what then refers to the sectoral

827
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,000
sanctions

828
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,440
i mean the economy is in shambles

829
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,960
uh before it's a very weak economy

830
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,559
it's it's it's a moderately reformed

831
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,919
soviet economy

832
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,519
and of course the russians have been fed

833
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,679
up with it for a long time because they

834
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,679
have to bail it out now and then

835
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,360
and of course what we have been doing

836
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,799
particularly the u.s lately but also

837
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,080
lithuania

838
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,080
have been helping the belarus economy uh

839
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,199
to withstand some of the measures taken

840
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,360
by russia

841
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,440
uh when secretary pompeo was there in

842
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,360
march for example one of the things was

843
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,480
that u.s oil deliveries to the

844
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,519
refineries

845
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,640
in order to make them go because russian

846
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,279
deliveries were not uh going as well and

847
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,000
so so we have a balancing act here

848
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,840
sectoral

849
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,159
sanctions can take down the belarus

850
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,000
economy

851
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,919
it is not the russian economy it is the

852
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,200
belarus economy sexual sanctions can

853
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,799
take it down

854
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,760
um but that's that's something that

855
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,799
immediately would have uh belarus turned

856
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,000
up

857
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,320
the care of the kremlin uh so it's

858
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,039
a it's it's a somewhat double eight

859
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,519
swords

860
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,039
but i think for the worst of

861
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,840
contingencies

862
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,200
if if we have a very heavy clampdown by

863
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,199
violin by lukashenko

864
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,440
we should take down his economy come

865
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,960
whatever i mean

866
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:11,919
that there should be some some

867
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,840
some order we should not forget that

868
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,039
lukaszenko is distinctly unpopular in

869
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,158
moscow

870
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,879
um i would guess

871
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,399
that uh there are different camps in

872
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,000
moscow i mean there's clearly the

873
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,439
paranoia camp that

874
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,279
believes that sort of any any sort of

875
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,960
deal with this opposition means that we

876
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,720
will have the u.s army marching into

877
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,240
somalians tomorrow

878
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:40,320
um and there are those fairly paranoid

879
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,120
people around but also those saying

880
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,639
lukashenko thug is unreliable we we

881
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,840
don't really like him

882
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,559
um and and if we tie

883
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,080
ourselves to the mast of lukashenko

884
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,879
there's a risk of belarus

885
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,158
public opinion going the way of ukraine

886
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,480
long term

887
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,360
uh turning anti-russian in a way they

888
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,799
are not

889
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,080
and that is not in the long-term

890
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:07,440
interest of russia so perhaps the

891
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:10,000
moderate kremlin would view would be

892
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,720
well stabilized situation at the moment

893
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and then we

894
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:17,598
engineer some sort of transition

895
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,760
to some sort of reasonable guy

896
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,720
that could also open up to the west but

897
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,000
how that would

898
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:27,199
play out remains to be seen on the um

899
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,679
what we can do um well

900
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,520
you belsat was mentioned i mean belsat

901
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,440
is one of the things that we've done

902
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,040
it's not been entirely cheap i can tell

903
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,639
you

904
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,639
but anyhow and other things

905
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,078
telegram is of course a special issue

906
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,879
but there are issues related to that as

907
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,560
well it's

908
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,480
written as we know russian system the

909
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,719
russians have been trying to stop it

910
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,359
they've failed is now run from poland

911
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,279
um and and and is highly highly

912
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,119
significant but there are other things

913
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,119
that can be done as well eastern

914
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,640
partnership uh i think

915
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,760
is an instrument that should be used

916
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,359
um in the eastern partnership you have

917
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:12,480
three sort of democracies and you have

918
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,920
belarus and azerbaijan

919
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,320
but i think um

920
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,760
why don't call a meeting of the eastern

921
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,960
partnership

922
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,359
foreign ministers uh will the high

923
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,000
representative mr burel there

924
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,560
not with the entire crowd and perhaps do

925
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,640
it in yerevan

926
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,680
because one of the templates here is

927
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,440
clearly what happened

928
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,279
in the spring of 2018 in in armenia

929
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,119
where sort of a popular

930
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,800
rebellion or whatever we call it popular

931
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,400
manifestation

932
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,839
led to a change um

933
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,079
and i'm quite certain that sort of

934
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,480
moscow was nervous for a while

935
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,400
uh but moscow noted that in terms of

936
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,560
their basic security interest that was

937
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,800
not the issue it didn't change

938
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,040
and and they they they accepted a

939
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,640
significant change in in armenia

940
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:08,160
so it might be that yerevan kiev

941
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,279
which is now to certain extent uh

942
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,399
can can play a role here as well in

943
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,320
long-term working for for for for these

944
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,720
particular changes

945
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,000
um have i answered that question very

946
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,598
much prime minister

947
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,599
uh i think so and i think we also uh

948
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,280
will have a time for probably one or two

949
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,160
more questions and for the first one i'm

950
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,280
going to bring in a participant from the

951
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,240
audio from the uh with the video call

952
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,280
who is going to ask the question

953
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,680
hi it's paul taylor here in france

954
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,640
um good evening to good afternoon good

955
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,919
morning

956
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,640
to you three gentlemen um my question is

957
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,359
that

958
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,040
what's happening in belarus is it comes

959
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,520
against the backdrop of something that's

960
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,560
been going on for more than 20 years

961
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,000
which is a contest between russia and

962
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,520
the west

963
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,440
for ascendancy in what you might call

964
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,119
the gray zone of the former soviet

965
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,720
republics that dwell

966
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,680
between russia and nato and the european

967
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,319
union

968
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,319
and while several of you have said we

969
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,880
don't want to bring in geopolitics that

970
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,000
that is there that's in the room and it

971
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,440
affects russian

972
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,480
thinking just as it affects our thinking

973
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,320
question as part of

974
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,359
a a a a an attempt to defuse

975
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,760
uh this and allow the belarusian people

976
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,040
to actually get what they're after which

977
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,520
is clean

978
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,200
fair elections and an end to tyranny

979
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,400
wouldn't it make sense

980
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,960
for us to state a bit more clearly that

981
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,400
where

982
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,560
neither russia nor the eu is looking to

983
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,400
take in belarus

984
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,000
and if that worked there perhaps it

985
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,680
might work in other countries in the

986
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,800
region where we've made

987
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,000
uh rash promises that we're unable to

988
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,760
keep

989
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,160
thank you thank you very much paul

990
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,920
and since we will have to be wrapping up

991
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,799
in about six minutes i'll add one more

992
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,359
question from the

993
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,240
participants and the question is about

994
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,400
the

995
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,919
lessons learned from the past round of

996
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,920
sanctions

997
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,599
what we learned what works what doesn't

998
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,160
work and whether it makes sense to

999
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,119
introduce

1000
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,920
the sanctions against and i will start

1001
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,640
this time

1002
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,200
from the other end and please try to fit

1003
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,160
your remarks in about two minutes

1004
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,160
prime minister build

1005
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,759
well on on sanctions we do have previous

1006
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,920
experience with sanctions

1007
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,880
in in in belarus after previous

1008
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,920
elections

1009
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,520
and where we we had toilet sanctions

1010
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,040
and we said we're going to have them as

1011
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,920
long as you don't release political

1012
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,520
prisoners

1013
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,440
political prisoners were released it

1014
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,599
took some time but but

1015
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,599
with a couple of other factors it did

1016
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,160
work so it's not

1017
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,280
it is not useless on paul taylor's

1018
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,480
question

1019
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,240
i wouldn't face it like that um

1020
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,480
this is question of democracy this is

1021
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,359
question of human rights nothing else

1022
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,119
um it is up to the people of belarus to

1023
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,400
choose their particular orientation i

1024
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,800
think what we could state

1025
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,800
is that the security arrangements that

1026
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,640
are there between

1027
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,720
between russia and banneras they have a

1028
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,680
couple of uh defense fighters they have

1029
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,598
a

1030
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,520
strategic communication stations they

1031
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,880
have a highly significant

1032
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,800
air defense or strategic early warning

1033
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,920
facility there

1034
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,119
we have no objections to that uh because

1035
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,480
these are clearly defensive

1036
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,440
installations and you can see the

1037
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,680
defensive

1038
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,480
security interest that that that moscow

1039
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,279
has

1040
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,640
but that is a decision to be taken by

1041
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,200
belarus

1042
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,640
and by moscow it is not something that

1043
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,240
we have views on

1044
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,839
but we certainly don't have any

1045
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,399
objections to them

1046
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,599
because we see them as uh in their

1047
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,040
present form

1048
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,040
distinctly non-threatening

1049
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,960
thank you very much prime minister and

1050
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,040
ambassador fred

1051
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,440
uh we're back to sanctions again and to

1052
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,040
geopolitics versus the determination of

1053
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,599
the people

1054
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:12,960
right first i agree with carl belt

1055
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,880
we should not and i'll put it this way

1056
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,040
we should not be in a hurry to start

1057
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,000
drawing lines on a map

1058
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,839
it would be a poor response to the

1059
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,040
yellow russians demand for free

1060
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,880
elections

1061
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:30,160
if we said that we were going to

1062
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,920
essentially consign them to russia's

1063
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,640
sphere of influence

1064
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,319
it's not that is not the issue it's

1065
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,319
about three elections

1066
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,359
the yellow russian people have not

1067
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,839
challenged their relations with moscow

1068
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,040
therefore we need not raise that issue

1069
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,480
whatsoever

1070
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,319
and we certainly need not um

1071
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,240
give the russians something which they

1072
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,680
don't deserve which is

1073
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,919
a recognition that they are uh that bail

1074
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,399
or us in some sense belongs to them if

1075
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,400
the law

1076
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,400
belarus belongs to the bella russian

1077
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,880
people full stop

1078
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,560
they do not demand anything more than

1079
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,760
free elections and the right to run

1080
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,119
their own country

1081
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,880
and that's where we ought to leave

1082
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,839
things

1083
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,119
with respect to sanctions look i do not

1084
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,160
look at sanctions

1085
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,680
as a magic problem solver

1086
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,319
they can be a useful tool to advance a

1087
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,919
policy that otherwise makes sense

1088
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,480
and our policy ought to be united

1089
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,800
it ought to seek support of the yellow

1090
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,599
russian people for the short term

1091
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,920
and the long term combined with

1092
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,040
cautionary notes to moscow i'll be

1093
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,119
interested

1094
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,160
to see what conclusions steve begin

1095
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,960
makes after his trips

1096
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,040
he's one of the trump administration

1097
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,560
officials committed to working

1098
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,200
with europe um and on behalf of

1099
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,560
reasonable policies to advance

1100
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,919
um basic human rights so that's a

1101
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,640
that's a good start we need to get

1102
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,119
ourselves

1103
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,680
lined up behind the bella russian people

1104
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,599
not

1105
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,399
ahead of them and certainly not

1106
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,400
undercutting them

1107
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,400
thank you very much ambassador uh this

1108
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,640
isn't it a very

1109
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,520
difficult situation because for the

1110
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,520
belarusian

1111
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,920
people themselves it was not a

1112
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,560
geopolitical election from the point of

1113
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,800
view

1114
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,200
whether people were expressing their

1115
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,000
views towards the us

1116
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,040
eu or russia or other external forces it

1117
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,520
was indeed a very

1118
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,040
purely internal situation but definitely

1119
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,839
for the countries around it

1120
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,520
it's a very geopolitical question which

1121
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,720
has to be squared against

1122
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,640
with the principle of the

1123
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,240
self-determination of people

1124
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,640
and ambassador zivert for your

1125
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,598
concluding word uh besides the question

1126
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,720
that were addressed

1127
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,119
i would also ask you to reflect a little

1128
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,560
bit

1129
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,040
on the how a geopolitical

1130
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,759
commission and geopolitical european

1131
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,079
union

1132
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,359
can square this line that we want to be

1133
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:06,079
both geopolitical but at the same time

1134
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,440
actively are saying that this issue is

1135
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,000
not a geopolitical

1136
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,839
and we need to leave the future of their

1137
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,839
countries in the hands of the people

1138
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,000
yeah that is a interesting way you

1139
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,279
you formulate your question i think

1140
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,839
these two things in

1141
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,880
here are not directly linked i fully

1142
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,240
agree with

1143
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,480
that dan fried that this is belarus is

1144
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,680
not about geopolitics at the moment it

1145
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,760
may be

1146
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,839
kind of the elephant in the room for

1147
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,240
many people thinking about the situation

1148
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,200
but the people there should be supported

1149
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,919
in their

1150
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,399
endeavor to get freedom free elections

1151
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,760
and

1152
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,839
and civil participation and we should

1153
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,960
not raise a question that is not raised

1154
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,160
by them

1155
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,359
so with moscow the messaging should be

1156
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,240
very clear

1157
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,440
we have talked about possible sanctions

1158
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,160
etc i think

1159
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,520
now it's the time for messaging to

1160
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,240
moscow

1161
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,079
which is being done and i'm sure that

1162
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,359
moscow also understands the

1163
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:14,480
linkages between their role

1164
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:19,200
in belarus their own internal situation

1165
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:21,520
the costs that any interference may have

1166
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,759
internally and also these are the people

1167
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,119
in belarus i think these are

1168
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,319
important topics economic sanctions

1169
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,280
i would be very careful maybe as it

1170
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,960
has been said a last resort against

1171
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,000
belarus because it would hit the

1172
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,920
population

1173
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,800
and the opposition as well

1174
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,160
this is not what we should look at at

1175
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,400
the moment

1176
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,279
rather we should try to use any chance

1177
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,520
to help

1178
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,480
for a national dialogue for a situation

1179
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,440
maybe as in armenia

1180
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,359
certainly belarus is located in a

1181
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,680
different position on the globe than

1182
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,799
armenia and the relationship with moscow

1183
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,000
is different

1184
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,680
but that could be a way i

1185
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,079
i wish that what has been said that it

1186
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,879
looks a little bit like poland in 1980

1187
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,720
and kiev in 2006.

1188
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,640
i hope it is not too much like a proud

1189
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:21,680
1968 we have to work for that

1190
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,520
and we should keep all possibilities

1191
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,118
open to reconnect to the country

1192
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,000
whenever the situation

1193
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,000
evolves in a positive direction and to

1194
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,280
continue the dialogue and we should look

1195
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,119
at the eastern partnership

1196
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,839
in that vein that we re-target it a

1197
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,520
little bit

1198
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:42,640
now in order to help the society

1199
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,640
and and to to

1200
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,000
allow for further context whenever the

1201
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,759
situation improves

1202
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,480
in in belarus thank you very much

1203
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,800
ambassador

1204
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,520
indeed belarusian people have already

1205
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,599
shown their

1206
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,119
ability to choose their own way and

1207
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,040
despite the fact that there are many

1208
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,040
parallels that can be drawn with other

1209
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,160
scenarios we do hope that the

1210
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,960
situation will be resolved uh

1211
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,799
similar to all the positive cases and

1212
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,800
probably learning from the mistakes that

1213
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,520
were learned in the negative cases

1214
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,599
but thank you very much uh for the great

1215

1216
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,119
