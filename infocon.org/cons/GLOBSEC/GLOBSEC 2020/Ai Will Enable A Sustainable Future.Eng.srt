18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,680
and there is also a couple of poll

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
questions related to the session

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,560
to make it a little bit more interactive

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,280
a bit of background on today's session

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,000
first

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,119
we are facing environmental challenges

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,280
like climate change and

25
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,200
also biodiversity and one of the

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,360
solutions to help us through it

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
is to harness the potential of emerging

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,920
technologies and if you think of public

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,400
policy

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,000
priorities at eu level for instance

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
speaking to you from brussels green and

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
digital are the two priorities of the

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
current commission

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
as advances in ai could really help

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,560
achieve the objectives of the green deal

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,039
and success and competitiveness in the

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
data economy especially postcovid

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,119
there are several such technologies that

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,759
look like promising candidates for the

40
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,159
next

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,280
innovation wave and in the context of

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
achieving

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
more sustainable

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,840
sustainably developed economy in society

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,240
there's iot

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,240
robotics blockchain autonomous devices

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,560
and ai and perhaps ai

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,000
is the most important one it's already

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,479
deployed in a wide range

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
of economic sector to contribute to

51
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,040
managing environmental impacts in

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,360
climate change

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,040
think of um applications such as

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,520
precision agriculture

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,480
sustainable supply chains environmental

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
monitoring

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,319
and hence climate modeling and disaster

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
prediction as well these applications

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,799
are broadening

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,319
and there can be more to it in the near

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,599
future so how

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,440
is and can ai be a driver of economic

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,440
growth why observing the objective of

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,840
climate neutrality and the reduction of

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,040
emissions what is the business and

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,360
policy perspective

67
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,560
of stakeholders in the space such as

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,760
startups

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,920
scale ups investors business strategies

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,879
and larger corporations what role are

71
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,518
these stakeholders

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,799
playing with me today we have three

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,720
great speakers which

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,720
i will ask a few questions too before we

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,959
move to the conversation and questions

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,519
and answers from the audience first

is leading the company's progress and

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,159
sustainable development for ai as a

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,200
policy area now jumping right through

99
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,959
the conversation uh why are we

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
talking about emerging technologies like

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
ai or even blockchain

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,319
in the context of environmental

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,720
sustainability uh

104
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,798
green public policies and corporate

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,439
responsibility why does it matter

106
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,000
for businesses what is the promise uh

107
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,519
maybe

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,519
going first to you jacques

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,200
thanks ellen for the introduction i

110
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,839
guess the reason why

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,280
today the two access of technologies and

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,399
sustainabilities

113
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
are so much a hot topic is as you said

114
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,560
ai

115
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
is typically the next wave of digital

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,080
technologies

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,759
and especially the breakthrough is

118
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,919
coming via deep learning

119
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
and the technology is becoming extremely

120
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,120
effective

121
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,840
in finding solutions for complex

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,560
problems of which we need a solution and

123
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,758
indeed

124
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,880
as we know the product sustainability is

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,000
a very complex

126
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,040
multi dimensional problems that

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,160
we are going to face and indeed we hope

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
that the ai

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,120
will be one of the technologies of the

130
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,160
promising technologies to

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,800
help solve some of those issues

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,400
now just to give an example if you think

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
about sustainability

134
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,599
uh you need at least to discover let's

135
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,600
say real-time patterns in climate change

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
and it was not possible before because

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,360
not only didn't get the data

138
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
but today not only you have the data but

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,080
you can simulate non-linear system

140
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,080
dynamics

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,159
that will require machine learning

142
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,960
techniques to solve the insight that you

143
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
can emerge

144
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,520
that you can find emerging from the data

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,360
that's exactly where ai

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,758
can play now the second reason why

147
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,840
this is so hard at this stage is that

148
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,479
not only sustainability is a is a hot

149
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,638
topic

150
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
but i think there is an awareness that

151
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,160
the

152
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,440
operating model is if i call it this way

153
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
of economics

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,840
has been depleting resource too fast and

155
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,199
energy fuels overheat

156
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,479
uh the planet uh and we all know what's

157
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,560
happening with the global

158
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,758
uh warming now the fundamental question

159
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
of the global warming

160
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
it's not what's going to happen by 2030

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,360
we

162
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,638
all know that people say look at least

163
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
by 2030

164
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
we could be eating the threshold of the

165
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,120
1.5 degrees celsius

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,919
uh a temperature higher than what it is

167
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
today

168
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,318
but what people start to realize at this

169
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,520
stage is that

170
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,280
when we come to that level if the impact

171
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,318
on gdp and well-being

172
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,000
uh which i estimate to be you know for

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:23,199
one degree of extra warming to be 0.2

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,840
0.5 points of gdp it could be three to

175
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,400
five times

176
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,560
larger when you hit the threshold so

177
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,719
imagine that this is the case

178
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,000
that means it's a minus two minus three

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,039
percent a year

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,199
of impact on gdp uh possibly

181
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,800
of what we have found from the covet at

182
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,199
this stage so that means that

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
it's a significant impact and people

184
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,800
realize that

185
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,520
uh we're gonna need faster commitment

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
that what

187
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,359
has been done at the at the paris

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,360
agreement and at the end of the day that

189
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,639
means that people need to find solution

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,319
and ai is part of that finally

191
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,520
covet is there and covet has basically

192
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,720
shown the way

193
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,080
they basically uh well what it means

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,039
is simply the realization that a global

195
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,599
pandemic

196
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,039
can hurt and really hurts everyone and

197
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,440
people come to realize

198
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,199
that if you don't do not accelerate on

199
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,360
the issue of sustainability

200
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
will be facing a war soon and something

201
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,039
which is

202
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,440
as damaging as uncomfortable as what we

203
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,039
have just noticed with the covet itself

204
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,479
so there as well the hope is that the

205
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,719
technology like ai

206
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,240
can help a quick fix and as ai

207
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,440
contributes already

208
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,440
uh to secure many things by the way on

209
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,840
automation online shopping robotics as

210
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,880
you mentioned and remote work

211
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,799
uh i will not to say that and by the way

212
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,479
this is not only a question about the

213
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,240
general public

214
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:52,318
you talk uh 18 about cooperation

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,039
and i would argue that a corporation

216
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,879
basically understand that this is quite

217
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,840
important first the market for the first

218
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,319
time

219
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,679
it's actually pricing the risk of

220
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,240
sustainability

221
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,039
as heavily as what we've seen for the

222
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,680
covet

223
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,680
typically economic research tell us that

224
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,360
one to 1.5 points

225
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,560
of return today is explained uh

226
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,560
by the resilience to covet for any

227
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,000
uh performance of firms that's a

228
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,800
significant numbers this

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,039
echoes uh pretty much the the difference

230
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,919
in

231
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,280
in return that we got for a company that

232
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,719
happened to be

233
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,958
very csr compliant versus not so that

234
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,719
pretty much means that it's quite big

235
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,399
last but not least it's not only a

236
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,599
question of threat it's a question of

237
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,519
opportunities

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,120
today companies can brand their

239
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,880
activities as caring for

240
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
more human causes than just selling

241
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,600
products and it's not only a branding

242
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,040
we all know that companies can be better

243
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
off if they diversify

244
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
and build new sustainable and greener

245
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,519
products advantage

246
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,680
towards by the way signal of the

247
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,240
population today that they've bought

248
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,479
some personal power and a real dogma

249
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,519
towards more sustainability

250
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,440
uh and finally here's the good news

251
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,399
uh we all talk about sustainability as a

252
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,560
complex problem from the corporate world

253
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,560
at the end of the day uh if you think

254
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,959
about recycling and the

255
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,079
and especially recycling

256
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,319
it can help a lot of resource saving and

257
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,920
the cost economic of the equations

258
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,320
is actually quite good

259
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,519
thank you very much jacques there was a

260
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,080
very comprehensive

261
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,920
overview of some of the the drivers

262
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
behind the use of this technology and

263
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880
its promise i'd like to turn to ines to

264
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,360
to collect

265
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,880
your your thoughts uh as you know your

266
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,640
your company is called digital for the

267
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,800
planet so obviously it is

268
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,959
you know sustainability and technology

269
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,359
is at the core of what you do

270
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,599
so i wanted to know your take on the

271
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
promise of the technology that you see

272
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
every day in your work some of the

273
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,040
drivers behind its growth and its

274
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,040
potential but also maybe some obstacles

275
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,240
i know that jack talked about data maybe

276
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,880
that's something

277
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,480
you might be able to say uh to to to

278
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,959
share something about and

279
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,160
perhaps do you concur that with within

280
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,599
the current context

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,519
which is the one of kovid uh that um

282
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
that technology has gained uh

283
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,560
significant uh

284
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,959
importance i know there's a that's

285
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,839
debatable uh but i'd like to know your

286
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,839
your thoughts on that

287
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,279
like you said the jacket has been quite

288
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
exhaustive on the importance of that i

289
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,000
can do today

290
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,519
thanks to ai and also the the

291
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,640
the the context between povet 19

292
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,720
but i i will be add some uh thought

293
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,920
about blockchain and how can blockchain

294
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,160
as you ask

295
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,360
in chile can about sustainability

296
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,680
maybe have to what it is or what is for

297
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,120
blockchain offers a system of recording

298
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,959
information

299
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,720
on a way that makes it very difficult

300
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:03,518
nearly impossible to alter

301
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,800
that's because record of every new

302
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,399
transaction needs to be

303
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,599
added to each of the ledger that can be

304
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,200
hundreds or thousands um

305
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,000
before transaction is verified

306
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,360
and blockchain can have is having

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,880
actually an emerging role in

308
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,160
sustainability

309
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,560
by helping faster collaboration between

310
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,040
customers and producers

311
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,079
by people in adopting more sustained

312
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,279
sustainable

313
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,640
lifestyles uh but also by helping

314
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,680
companies improve

315
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,800
boosting and uh recycling practice uh to

316
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,199
be more specific

317
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,160
um um sorry and another major benefit

318
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,880
so it can ensure transparency that means

319
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,680
company

320
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,439
explains uh of being resource uh

321
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,439
positive and reducing their

322
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,279
environment impact can be

323
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,440
counter-checked and verified

324
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,920
which is quite important when that sixty

325
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,639
percent of customers are likelier to buy

326
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,040
product

327
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,040
with verified sustainable practices

328
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,639
about blockchains for now maybe i would

329
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,880
like to

330
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,720
save some time for israel then maybe you

331
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,639
can i know you have more

332
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,680
than oh thank you very much

333
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,880
uh yes turning to you uh edward so uh

334
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,279
of of why way uh i'm i'm sure that

335
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,360
uh sustainability is on the agenda of of

336
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,200
your cooperation as it is on many others

337
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,120
what is what are the trends that you see

338
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,639
what are the the promises that you see

339
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,639
what are some of the use cases the

340
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,200
technologies that you see really are

341
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,720
uh helpful towards achieving climate

342
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,720
neutrality and sustainability

343
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,639
yes um thank you very much um helena i

344
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
think i'm on

345
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
your eyes that artificial intelligence

346
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
has

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,440
come from general purpose technologies

348
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,639
so we believe that it can be used in

349
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,200
many industries

350
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,680
in all the sectors and especially you

351
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,279
mentioned

352
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,719
that yes as a large corporate probably

353
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,480
also we have

354
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,519
our own sustainability strategy

355
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,959
in line with the united nations as

356
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,959
sustainability development goals so we

357
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,518
set including the digital inclusive

358
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,359
security and trustworthiness

359
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,639
environmental protection

360
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,480
and also the healthy and harmonized

361
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,120
ecosystems this is our sustainability

362
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,519
report of

363
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,959
2019 and also in

364
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,160
2019 we released our tag for all

365
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,880
action plan so that is um

366
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,360
very important for us to know which we

367
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
can

368
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,720
extend our environmental work to enable

369
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,079
the

370
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,120
protection of the fragile environments

371
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,760
so we work together with rainforest

372
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
connection which is a non-profit

373
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,480
organization

374
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,639
that upcycle our old phone of our own

375
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,680
cell phones into the solar powered

376
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,120
gardens

377
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,120
that are placed into the rain forest

378
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,560
collecting the environmental suns and

379
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,920
upload them into

380
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,439
the cloud so the data is analyzed

381
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,560
by the ai systems to assist

382
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,680
in conservation of the efforts in the

383
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,239
rain forest and

384
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,959
protect the rain forest so and also the

385
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,680
animals

386
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,638
from the illegal logging and some other

387
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,079
illegal

388
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,320
activities so this model is now being

389
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,439
used in more than 10 countries

390
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,560
so we are trying to extend this

391
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,360
to 6 000 square kilometers protected

392
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,560
areas

393
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,279
by the end of 2020 and also thanks to

394
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,319
the ai

395
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,360
technologies we believe that can help

396
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,920
significantly to protect the environment

397
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,800
so this is some kind of use cases we

398
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,319
believe can

399
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,519
bring to the industry and bring to the

400
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,480
society

401
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,639
which proves that the ei also can be

402
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,760
used widely in their sustainabilities

403
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,600
thank you thank you thank you edward i

404
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
have a follow-up question if i may you

405
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
mentioned

406
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,519
uh deployment on some use cases in

407
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,000
various countries

408
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,639
uh my question would be do you see any

409
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,040
trend

410
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,000
in particular countries or regions that

411
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,920
you see are really

412
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,600
on top of using ai and sustainable

413
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,519
to towards achieving sustainable

414
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,880
development are there some regions that

415
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,320
are lagging behind where you know

416
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,560
awareness may be less

417
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,519
strong do you could you share something

418
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,359
about that

419
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,360
well i think that now that um

420
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,519
oh yes please the question was for

421
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:55,839
edward but or well

422
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,839
but with this much

423
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,160
that come from many different regions um

424
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,959
yes now we are setting up our action

425
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,480
plan

426
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,599
to work in some rank um forest

427
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,000
but also we do believe the system the

428
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,480
solutions can be used to protect

429
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,519
some other environments such as under

430
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,720
the sea

431
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,480
because the mechanism is quite simple

432
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,279
we monitoring the sound and uploads the

433
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,040
data

434
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:32,079
then the system can

435
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,920
distinguish or recognize the sound

436
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,040
of the activities so it can take action

437
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,319
after that

438
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,959
so this is uh the mechanism uh we can

439
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,759
see that

440
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,719
for the rain forest and the sea and

441
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,160
under the ocean so this is a kind of um

442
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,399
activities we are working on

443
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,839
well also i know that in europe this is

444
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,000
a very hot topic

445
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
to protect the environment so we do

446
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,680
believe this

447
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,680
system this solution can be used widely

448
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,640
thank you uh jacques some sort of a

449
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,160
related question

450
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,720
uh twofold um what are the sectors that

451
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,400
you see

452
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,319
in the economy that are really at the

453
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,799
forefront uh when it comes to adopting

454
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,199
ai

455
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,199
uh for for this sort of you know

456
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,720
tackling environmental challenges

457
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,880
uh and another part of the question

458
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,360
would be as as you're an investor

459
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
how do you determine uh when it's worth

460
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,719
funding

461
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,600
research and development in this field

462
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,400
yeah thank you

463
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,320
it's an interesting question so first of

464
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,440
all i think from a thesis point of view

465
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,039
as i said the corporate world basically

466
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,320
start to realize that

467
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,640
the price of unsustainable business

468
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,120
model but in sustainability resource

469
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,799
is actually equivalent so at the end of

470
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,639
the day what we see is that

471
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,559
corporations are actually putting that

472
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
on the agenda that's a good news

473
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,760
and on top of that obviously they will

474
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,000
use any means and

475
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,799
means could be digitalization could be

476
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,320
whatever

477
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,879
materials they have enhanced and

478
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,080
obviously ai now if you look at

479
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,440
the evolution we all know what the key

480
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,600
cases will be

481
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,799
the key case obviously happens to be the

482
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,399
transport side

483
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
and and by the way the transport the

484
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,280
first element of uh

485
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,720
reducing let's say a gas emission for

486
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,000
instance is to uh

487
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,840
uh is to shift to electricity but

488
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,760
the second case obviously which is

489
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,879
slightly smaller in size

490
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,760
is what we see today which is uh uh

491
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,120
the competitions towards uh aiding cards

492
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,480
that are autonomous

493
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,799
the reason being when you have

494
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,679
autonomous car and you can basically

495
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,240
have the flow much more easier in terms

496
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,480
of the

497
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
of the traffic you optimize urban

498
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
transport to

499
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,200
root and traffic optimization and you

500
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,760
save quite a lot so we see

501
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,520
in transport this is a case where the

502
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,640
use case is well defined you see the

503
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,120
same in energy

504
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,320
where energy is obviously 50 of the cost

505
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,639
of what we see

506
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,000
in term of emissions so there as well uh

507
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,240
distributed energy

508
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
uh grades for instance and ai would be

509
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,679
quite terrific

510
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,880
and you talked already about smart

511
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,240
agriculture

512
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,280
and food systems so these three sectors

513
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,080
should be at the forefront of doing that

514
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,120
now the interesting thing if you look at

515
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,240
ai

516
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,879
uh because this let's call them the most

517
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,760
politi

518
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,080
polluting sectors there are industrial

519
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,799
based they are resource extraction based

520
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
they are transport based or energy based

521
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,320
most of the time

522
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,039
uh uh they are not necessarily service

523
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,600
based

524
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,039
like we see in media like in telecom and

525
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,520
the like otherwise stated

526
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,080
they lag behind in ai so there is a bit

527
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,320
of a

528
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,120
interesting point here where in fact the

529
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,480
ai adoption saviness or speed of

530
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,959
adoption of ai

531
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,919
is slightly negatively created with the

532
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,799
sectors

533
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,400
that need the most or they will benefit

534
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,440
the most from the system of the

535
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,080
polluting

536
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,760
now uh uh that's important but in

537
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,158
general i will say that

538
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,360
this is one way to look uh the other way

539
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
to look is that

540
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,080
you have to look within the industry and

541
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,120
within the industry what we find

542
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,360
is that there are really two types of

543
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,039
or three types of companies some that

544
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,000
are not aiav

545
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,679
that not necessarily having a

546
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
sustainability agenda

547
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,679
calling the laggers calling the old

548
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,080
worlds but they're likely not to be in

549
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,919
good shape in a five to ten years time

550
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,000
they are obviously the one in the middle

551
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,039
uh that possibly have a bit of digital

552
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,120
saviness

553
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,320
they think about sustainability but they

554
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,799
are doing that in a

555
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,799
light touch use case so these guys are

556
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,400
pretty much the natural incumbent

557
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,400
they do things but they do it at the

558
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,320
margin they don't do it at scale

559
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,480
i don't think they will move the needle

560
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,399
uh but at least they try

561
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,240
and finally you got the guys that's

562
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,520
really do the lit you know

563
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,320
push that as a leadership model and push

564
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,240
ai and sustainability as part of the

565
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,799
corporate agenda now

566
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,280
who are those companies we all know them

567
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,440
the

568
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,240
the the tesla of these words because

569
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,039
obviously they want to revolutionize

570
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,799
a full industry so they will invest in

571
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,879
electricity with the battery and they

572
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,240
will obviously invest in automated scar

573
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,400
to transform the transport electricity

574
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,159
and so in fact what we have to look it's

575
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,000
much more about who these digital

576
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
reinventers will be

577
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,240
because these guys typically have the ai

578
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,280
capabilities and on top of that

579
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
fine in sustainability a great way to

580
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,240
disrupt

581
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,200
and to be compliant with the necessity

582
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,400
to be carbon neutral if you like or even

583
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,640
extremely uh uh friendly

584
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,080
in term of resource depletion and last

585
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,039
but not least because you asked the

586
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,639
question

587
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,919
because your question about ai and

588
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,120
sustainability is it always positive

589
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:56,400
no we all know today that

590
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,678
most of the models of ai need to train

591
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,120
a lot of data and uh usually some of the

592
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,039
algorithms are not necessarily that

593
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,399
effective at this stage so they use the

594
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,480
brutal force

595
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,400
of the network the cloud to basically

596
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,520
run algorithms and train the data to

597
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,640
find an algorithm

598
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,440
that's extremely energy intensive in

599
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,440
some cases some researchers have

600
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,280
some research have even claimed that

601
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,280
sometimes that could be three to five

602
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:27,760
times per unit much more carbon

603
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,600
uh uh heavy than any other type of

604
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,280
transport that you can imagine so that

605
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,439
means that these companies

606
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,120
especially the google of these words or

607
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
the microsoft the facebook of these

608
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,520
words or the chinese

609
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
uh digital companies actually in the

610
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,879
mood

611
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,480
in the necessity to actually push even

612
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,320
more carbon neutrality

613
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,600
and in fact that's what we see we see

614
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,480
that they use actually

615
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,000
ai to solve their own problem to make

616
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,799
sure the clouds

617
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,720
the cloud system or infrastructure is

618
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,158
actually much more carbon neutral i

619
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,360
think google has done that quite

620
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,799
extensively

621
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,918
uh lately i think they they reduce uh

622
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,000
uh the cloud energy by 25

623
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,880
and by the way if you look at amazon web

624
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,559
services already in 2015 they reduced by

625
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,640
25 percent already

626
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,280
the use of energy i think today that's

627
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,960
at 50 60. so bottom line

628
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,559
i think the point i'm making is that the

629
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,360
politics sectors

630
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,120
are yet to be ai savvy but they are

631
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,080
moving quite fast

632
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,399
the technology providers of ai actually

633
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,120
not

634
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
yet necessarily energy efficient they're

635
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,879
moving quite fast

636
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,720
into that because they obviously have to

637
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,480
preach what they do

638
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,559
and at the end of the day i think these

639
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,840
guys will obviously provide the services

640
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,240
to these industries

641
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,600
and i guess that transport energy and

642
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,600
resource extraction

643
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,199
hopefully in a few years time will be

644
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,840
much more carbon neutral than they are

645
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
today

646
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,400
thank you uh jacques i've been reading

647
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,520
that digital technologies can

648
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,760
enable a 20 reduction in co2 emissions

649
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,679
by by 2030 so that would save

650
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,960
almost 10 times more the emissions that

651
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,640
it produced but uh

652
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,600
yes uh it is data uh energy wars let's

653
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,400
say um

654
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,080
and uh thank you for for elaborating on

655
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
this i really think you mentioned quite

656
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,799
well how

657
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,640
uh the two legs of resilience for for

658
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,158
businesses in in the future and

659
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,400
even starting now is really

660
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,400
digitalization on the one hand and

661
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,760
carbon neutrality or if efforts to

662
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,679
really uh improve

663
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,520
um sustainability um so thanks for that

664
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,120
i'd like to turn to you again ines

665
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,080
because i'm sure you have a few

666
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,239
reactions

667
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,760
after what you've heard and how do you

668
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,240
how do you really see

669
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,799
also the nexus from from from your

670
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,200
position

671
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,158
and you know ceo of digital for the

672
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,320
planet how

673
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,080
how can companies and governments and

674
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,399
citizens work towards

675
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,158
you know this nexus of ai and

676
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,440
sustainability together maybe there's

677
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,400
some practices that you

678
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,400
you can tell us about

679
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,959
um we have to put in priority

680
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,559
what we need mostly um

681
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,840
but once we said that we said nothing

682
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,918
we have to comprehend that the priority

683
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,360
is the needs of citizens otherwise it's

684
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,799
just economy

685
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,840
we have to be sure that um on a

686
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:25,279
government level that we use ai

687
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,080
as a potential efficient tool not as a

688
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,000
answer because in case it would be an

689
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,678
opportunity next more than to do

690
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,080
just this the the things right

691
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,960
and uh and that's the most important

692
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,480
today

693
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,960
there is many uh many many tricks

694
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,679
uh in the in the business of ai or

695
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,440
blockchain

696
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,240
it doesn't have to to be seen as

697
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,880
an economic body to make more business

698
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,919
as the

699
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,799
as the in the context we are living and

700
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,520
it's it's an opportunity to make things

701
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,080
right

702
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,799
for the people because the first one to

703
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,000
suffer

704
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,440
if we have a more serious climate

705
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,559
changer in the next year to come

706
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,159
but today we have many sectors when we

707
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:17,120
can um work together both with companies

708
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,320
new companies to be creative and

709
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,559
government

710
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,480
for example energy production we are

711
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,600
talking a lot about this but this is not

712
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,720
something done

713
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,678
um we can imagine a

714
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,840
better climate prediction and removal we

715
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,080
know that ai can do that now

716
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,879
and where it comes from because it's

717
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,840
nice to

718
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,400
talk about co2 but you have many sources

719
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,600
of

720
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,679
of and um uh we also

721
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,279
uh can do a lot with campaign government

722
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,770
about education

723
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,720
uh solar system

724
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,360
[Music]

725
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,000
but finance which is at the heart at the

726
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,360
center

727
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,159
of the whole matter um

728
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,199
we have to focus also on the energy

729
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,240
efficient

730
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,600
this is something some some often

731
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,400
left to side but this is something um

732
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,279
definitely

733
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,720
uh prominent and we are working digital

734
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,760
for the planet currently

735
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,279
with uh with the big public french bank

736
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,000
uh but also better monitoring of

737
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,559
deforestation and

738
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,039
how can we uh there is many debates

739
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,320
about

740
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:27,039
it uh nowadays and i i'm sure that

741
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,080
companies and government can

742
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:35,440
can work together on this topic

743
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,439
um yes that's what i mean

744
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,960
okay thank you so much ines um turning

745
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,600
to you again uh edward

746
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,799
uh so you've heard uh ines share about

747
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,158
how to to

748
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,799
raise awareness and also mentioning how

749
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,200
government

750
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,559
and industry can work together i'd like

751
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
to know your take on

752
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,080
on how that is going and what kind of

753
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,000
policies do you see are

754
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,840
um are really promising in supporting

755
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,520
the use of deployment of ai for

756
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,120
beneficial purposes

757
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,879
you know and support your you know the

758
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,879
applications that you're deploying

759
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,559
oh yes thank you very much for the

760
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,960
question i think um

761
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,799
now we discussed how the um

762
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,159
organizations can work together um

763
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,080
towards this

764
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:29,200
objective um so i i don't think um

765
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,879
to achieve the ends set out

766
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,720
in the european window and the

767
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,760
sustainable goals demands

768
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,720
actions coming from all the sectors

769
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,640
of the european economy so the long-term

770
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,120
vision is essential

771
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,080
and also we believe the connectivity is

772
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,879
strictly

773
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,120
linked with accessibilities so the

774
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,120
proper training and upskilling

775
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:56,879
of the workers should be in each

776
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,760
agenda so that they can actively

777
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,720
take part in the renewable digital

778
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,919
digitalized

779
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,520
society so i do think um

780
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,159
very important the skill set this is

781
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,240
one very important part and also we

782
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,480
suggest the policies maker

783
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,600
to adopt a long-term mission of the

784
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,080
environment

785
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,799
so the regulatory certainty for

786
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,600
industries

787
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,320
and the businesses will bring more

788
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,799
investment

789
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,760
in the modernization and reduction of

790
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,480
the

791
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,480
environmental impacts and also building

792
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,279
a very strong acceptance of

793
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,480
with stakeholders and embracing the

794
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,440
opportunities

795
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,960
connected to the digitalization for the

796
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,720
climate change

797
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,880
clean energy and circular economic

798
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
transition and also the energy

799
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,960
management water

800
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,240
water management sustainable buildings

801
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,720
smart cities

802
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,880
digital enabled sustainable transport

803
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,600
technologies like we discussed

804
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,840
and will that will ensure that i'm

805
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,279
falling on the green deal through the

806
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,399
climate change and fully digital transit

807
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,520
uh transition

808
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:11,120
so i think by doing all of this

809
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,440
our ambition can be met by aligning

810
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,239
all the digital technologies financing

811
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,279
tools and

812
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,799
objectives so that's just something

813
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,799
in my mind at the moment

814
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,360
thank you that's very useful um so you

815
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,840
mentioned skills

816
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,959
long-term vision uh you know investment

817
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,240
uh there's some

818
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,200
um some things to really um look after

819
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,760
or really focus

820
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,600
on i'd like to ask you all one last

821
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,120
question before uh picking a couple of

822
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,039
questions from the participants

823
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,120
i'd like to know what if you could uh

824
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,760
sit down with a policymaker or

825
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,439
maybe an investor uh some stakeholder

826
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,000
involved in this conversation what would

827
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,120
you say

828
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,440
is the uh most pressing

829
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,559
policy and business and or business

830
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,320
challenge

831
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,240
and what should be addressed as a first

832
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,600
line of priority when it comes to ai for

833
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,519
sustainable development

834
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,480
jack perhaps you have a yeah

835
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,519
let me answer from a different angle but

836
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,919
and i will lead to

837
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,760
to your question uh which is exactly

838
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,559
what i like in uh

839
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,000
in the european institution uh a new

840
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,279
strategy framework

841
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,679
in one way it's a two-pronged approach

842
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,760
with the green deal and the digital deal

843
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,519
and in fact if you look at the digital

844
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,960
deal it's actually moving to frontier

845
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,200
technologies like ai

846
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,159
and the like and if you look at this you

847
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,720
said look ai

848
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,080
we tried to catch up against china and

849
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,279
again the us

850
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,600
it's difficult uh we possibly have

851
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,640
possibly a better industrial perspective

852
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,240
than the us

853
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,640
and possibly a most advanced prod

854
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,840
manufacturing industry than china so we

855
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,120
can play there

856
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,080
and on top of that uh we are possibly

857
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,559
and i think it has been said we have

858
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,559
actually

859
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,678
citizens that are extremely caring and

860
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,080
recognizing

861
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,000
uh the necessity of sustainability so

862
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,760
which means that if we push that

863
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,360
while you know today the president of

864
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,640
the us is not necessarily a fan of

865
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,120
sustainability

866
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,000
and china obviously is possibly lagging

867
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,518
behind

868
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,679
uh still at this stage given its

869
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,880
industry structure and its priorities in

870
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,120
sustainability

871
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,480
we possibly have here a fantastic

872
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,840
differentiation

873
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,480
of european strategy where you can merge

874
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,080
an ai catch up into these sectors that

875
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,279
are very industrialized

876
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,760
which are still the common industrial

877
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,640
structure of europe with energy with

878
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,279
agriculture

879
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,080
and you name it and on the other side uh

880
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,720
uh

881
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,760
we've got uh the system the system with

882
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,240
the value

883
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,158
so both of that create a fantastic

884
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,200
impetus for europe to be at the

885
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,120
forefront of that

886
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,279
now come the question about how do we

887
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,840
realize that well first of all

888
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,720
uh if i look at europe first questions

889
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,240
will be

890
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,000
uh speed uh we have been there for uh in

891
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,399
europe for quite a long time

892
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,360
we haven't basically achieved all the

893
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,799
potential of the

894
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,639
of the single market and now we're

895
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,600
moving to the digital single mar

896
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,080
the digital single market so speeding

897
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,439
that

898
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,000
digital single market as fast as we can

899
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,480
it's obviously part and the real rollout

900
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,880
uh

901
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,799
policies that we have put should be a

902
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,919
first priority of the agenda

903
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,399
uh a second point which is uh uh quite

904
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,279
important it's about competition and

905
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,439
obviously the

906
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,600
the european market is a competition low

907
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,840
but if you think about the sectors

908
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,080
where uh we believe the opportunity is

909
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,279
the biggest it's called transport

910
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,199
it's called energy and we all know that

911
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,240
these sectors are pretty much

912
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,679
uh owned by incumbents and incumbent

913
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,559
obviously don't like

914
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,880
to be too much disrupted by this digital

915
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,918
that

916
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,480
that that nexus of digitalization

917
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,440
and and digital attackers so we have to

918
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,799
basically

919
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,399
uh fund and push uh uh uh

920
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,879
those uh uh those streams of the economy

921
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,678
uh to work and i also believe that the

922
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,679
economic competition low

923
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:12,079
element will be quite fascinating

924
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,359
and last but not least if we want ai to

925
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,200
work

926
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,119
we need obviously to think about that

927
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,678
from a 10 years point of view

928
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,919
that means a leadership model which is

929
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,040
not every three years we decide who else

930
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,918
will do that

931
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,918
and we will have to do things like data

932
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,719
we need data common data to work

933
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,040
and we possibly have to put institutions

934
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,439
uh

935
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,359
like the european uh like the european

936
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,800
institution but why not on the global

937
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,960
institution scale

938
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,560
we happen to have the cern we happen to

939
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,639
have a few things in europe

940
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,239
that could be a role model to basically

941
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,240
develop that global

942
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:50,158
uh uh a vision of what will be

943
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,399
uh the technologies but also the

944
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,399
standards the data sharing and the like

945
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,879
to meet the objective of sustainability

946
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,040
so again a lot to be done on the europa

947
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,040
european side but i think we've got the

948
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,480
tool know we have to basically put a bit

949
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,040
of sustainability

950
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,079
and the ai nexus around the point of

951
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,560
competition

952
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,760
global cooperation and i think europe

953
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,560
can do very well

954
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,200
indeed as a differentiation against the

955
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,400
fight

956
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,439
between the us and china

957
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,320
thank you jack so indeed cooperation

958
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,880
competition

959
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,960
data sharing ines what is your take on

960
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,520
the most pressing challenge and top

961
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,520
priority

962
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,520
it has been said that uh if we want to

963
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,040
apply

964
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,920
to work to work we have to

965
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,079
sustainability matters i i i would say

966
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,119
that if we want sustainability

967
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,320
we have to consider the tool and

968
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,599
maybe i can be one in that sense

969
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,000
it's more appropriate to me and

970
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,800
it can be one that i can be one of the

971
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
two needed for sustainability

972
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,520
in conditional itself that also uh what

973
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,560
i'm fighting for

974
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,480
uh to make uh logic

975
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:10,560
about ai more sustainable less energy

976
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:14,480
so where i joined jack buzana is uh

977
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,200
sorry it's about um cooperation in

978
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,760
europe

979
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,720
from the topics where they can find

980
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,240
cooperation

981
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:27,040
is digital ecology of course uh

982
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:29,839
we are the most present to you

983
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,400
be underlined for sustainability if we

984
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,560
regard

985
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:38,240
u.s and china that's a sovereignty

986
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:42,480
for citizen big topic also in e-health

987
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:46,959
we have among europe most of the

988
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:50,480
most prestigious um discovering

989
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,760
um in europe so we have to

990
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:57,359
capitalize on those three um

991
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,920
treat quick topics transversality

992
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,520
we have to work on sustainability in ai

993
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,040
so to have sustainable and

994
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,680
and cleaner uh greener

995
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,440
tools technology tools sustainability so

996
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,440
that there is no sense to

997
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,000
to to to to to use um technology which

998
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,359
is uh

999
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,680
energy costuming to tackle uh changing

1000
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,560
uh

1001
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,960
all the sustainability problems that

1002
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,480
will be

1003
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,480
my point of view and my angle

1004
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,839
thank you so much for sharing that with

1005
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,078
us today and perhaps

1006
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:37,040
one final word for you edward uh you

1007
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:39,680
have one minute

1008
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,160
yes so i i think um the most important

1009
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:46,640
thing for us is try to have um

1010
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:49,040
affordable ai services and ai solutions

1011
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,000
i think in order to let everybody can

1012
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,800
use this

1013
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,640
general purpose technologies that we are

1014
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,760
aiming to develop

1015
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,118
this full stack and all scenario

1016
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,800
solutions

1017
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,440
as a services to the public for all the

1018
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,240
people who can use that who can access

1019
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,079
to that

1020
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,399
affordable and competitive solutions

1021
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,079
uh to use the latest technologies we are

1022
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,359
aiming to do that i think this is

1023
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,680
very important for the policy to

1024
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,720
encourage the use of the technologies

1025
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,160
not only

1026
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,799
to limit the innovation on that so that

1027

is my

1028
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:33,119
