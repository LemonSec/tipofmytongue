hello and good morning or good afternoon

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,399
in europe

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,400
my name is mike carpenter i am the

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,400
managing director of the penn biden

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,240
center for diplomacy and global

engagement in washington

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,720
um i am moderating this fantastic panel

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,679
on

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,080
against state capture an important topic

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
that

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,920
has not been discussed in a lot of these

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,840
international conferences

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,439
in recent years but is critical to

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
understanding the developments in the

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,000
region

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,640
uh as i see it the geopolitical trend

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,680
of the 21st century is one of

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,439
competition

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,960
between liberal democracy on the one

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,919
hand and

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,479
oligarchic authoritarianism on the other

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,119
and

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,799
the two tectonic plates if you will

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,000
geopolitically speaking

43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,680
of liberal democracy and of uh

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
oligarchic authoritarianism

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
are colliding right in the center of

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,560
europe in the region

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,239
of ukraine moldova georgia

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,399
bulgaria and the balkans and this

49
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,480
tectonic clash is leading to

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
wars as we saw in georgia and ukraine

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,799
but it's also leading to a very

52
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
important phenomenon of state capture

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,520
which i will define

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,799
very broadly as the institutionalization

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,080
of corruption

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,120
in the political and economic arenas

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,319
it often occurs under the semblance of

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
due process but state capture really

59
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,079
entails

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,119
the capture as the word implies of the

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,680
judiciary

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,480
of the media uh of the court of the

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,319
courts

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,760
of law enforcement of intelligence

65
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,720
bodies this

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,480
is how would-be authoritarians get a

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,440
grip on power and then once they get a

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,280
grip on power

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
as we've seen in countries like belarus

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,519
and russia it is

71
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,319
very difficult for that grip to be pried

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,879
loose

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,839
so joining me today are three fantastic

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,640
panelists who know

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
a lot about the issue of state capture

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,760
we have maya sandhu

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
the leader of moldova's opposition party

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,440
uh of action

79
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
and solidarity a former prime minister

80
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,159
and

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,958
a candidate in the upcoming presidential

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,399
election

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
we also have nino evgeny executive

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
director

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,200
of the economic policy research center

86
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,518
in tbilisi georgia

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,119
and last but not least brian whitmore

88
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,200
director of the russia program

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239
at the center for european policy

90
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,238
analysis

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,599
so i'm going to dive right in and i'm

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,400
going to start with you

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,359
uh maya you have been prime minister of

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,879
moldova

95
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
um and yet your country in my humble

96
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,560
opinion

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,040
is the one that has most approximated

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,760
the

99
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,599
sort of quintessential essence of state

100
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,120
capture particularly under

101
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,319
oligarch vladimir plahot nuke so

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,879
if moldova did in fact witness

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,640
state capture under plato nuke where

104
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,679
does the situation stand today

105
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,359
is it still one of state capture or have

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
the institutions of the state

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,480
gradually become more competitive and

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
more

109
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,720
uh more contested by other opposition

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,120
parties like your own

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
um well first of all first i would like

112
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,358
to say that

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,160
state culture is much more damaging than

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,960
corruption corruption is an exception to

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,800
the system

116
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,440
why while the state culture is the way

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,160
the system works and moldova is probably

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,040
the best

119
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,840
example of a country where state capture

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,800
happened within a very short period of

121
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,599
time

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
and it came from outside power because

123
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,639
it was not like

124
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,360
a person or a group of uh corrupt people

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,160
first won the elections and then

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,320
captured

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,240
the state institutions it actually

128
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,479
happened before

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,919
they were in power and it started with

130
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,400
the justice sector

131
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,359
when these corrupt people would pay

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,719
judges

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,600
uh prosecutors uh people

134
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
in other state institutions and then

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,720
they built really

136
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,240
uh quickly a system which uh which

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,360
captured the state and i would like to

138
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,160
give a little bit a few more details

139
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,800
uh for instance when the famous or in

140
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
famous banking sector fraud happened in

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
moldova

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,320
uh in an amount of 12 percent of gbp

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,719
and then there was the initial

144
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,479
international report on this fraud

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,039
we all realized that this fraud happened

146
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,960
with the help of the national bank of

147
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,120
the uh prosecution

148
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,479
of the center for uh anti-money

149
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,520
laundering uh

150
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,039
so and this was really scary and

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,039
and it was a surprise because we

152
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,000
actually believed that we had a pretty

153
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,840
distant central bank independent and and

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,919
we didn't expect this to happen

155
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,599
and then it uh the next stage happened

156
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,440
in the parliament when the party

157
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,600
which won just 15 percent of these six

158
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,280
uh i mean 15 percent in the in the

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,039
parliamentary elections

160
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,239
in two weeks managed to swallow

161
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,120
uh most of the other political parties

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,680
most of the other

163
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,600
uh political factions in the parliament

164
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,600
and from this 15 percent

165
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
got the majority and all this was done

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,080
through corruption

167
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,520
uh by bribing members of the parliament

168
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,000
and by that time these people were

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,280
controlling enough uh prosecution

170
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,759
uh judges to actually also blackmail

171
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,719
such people and then it didn't take them

172
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,080
too long to

173
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,240
uh start acquiring uh the mayors

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,318
so at some point eighty percent of all

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,400
the mayors in the in the country

176
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,039
had to switch sides and to become

177
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,120
members of this one political party and

178
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,759
and even the political party was

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,759
actually uh being captured by this one

180
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,319
person and this was black with nuke

181
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,199
it's not easy to dismantle such a system

182
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,599
it was pretty

183
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,880
difficult to get plucked nuke out of the

184
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,759
of the system

185
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,719
um but then even when he ran out of the

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,680
country

187
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,520
for some three months uh his people in

188
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,039
all the state institutions

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,639
were still expecting him to come back

190
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,719
and unfortunately five months of course

191
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
is not is not enough to dismantle such a

192
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,520
system

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
the situation is better now in moldova

194
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,639
but not because the current

195
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
uh oligarch uh who happens to be also

196
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,160
the president

197
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,440
of the country doesn't want to continue

198
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,319
with the state capture

199
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,960
it's just that he hasn't been able to

200
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,160
capture

201
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,919
yet all the institutions but it has

202
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,039
made it easier for us now to oppose

203
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,919
the system and then to find the uh the

204
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,000
people

205
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
within the system who depose more

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,440
resistance but

207
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,280
uh the danger is still there we need to

208
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,360
get rid of these people soon enough

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,719
not to allow them to uh uh to build back

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,919
a really fully captured

211
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,400
uh state system

212
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,960
great thank you and now nina let me ask

213
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,000
you about

214
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,878
georgia because georgia um similar to

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,199
moldova

216
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,440
under the reign of plague nuke has an

217
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,639
oligarch but zina ivanishvili

218
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,599
who whose wealth really surpasses

219
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,039
that of anyone else in the country and

220
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,759
he's also the leader of a political

221
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,000
party

222
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,960
which has a large majority in the

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,759
georgian

224
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,120
georgian dream and so on the face of it

225
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,320
it looks like this is

226
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,519
also state capture um

227
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,959
is that the case are really the courts

228
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,839
the media large corporations and law

229
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,880
enforcement

230
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,959
all uh beholden to this one

231
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,240
individual or is the system more

232
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,640
competitive than it looks from the

233
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
outside

234
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
thank you so much mike for this question

235
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,320
even in my

236
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,760
like a worst dream i i will never

237
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,480
imagine that

238
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,319
we're gonna to speak about today georgia

239
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,200
in this context you know

240
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
because as you are aware and our friends

241
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,000
uh

242
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
in worldwide the georgia was one of the

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,399
best performers

244
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
uh among the like fighting against the

245
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,240
corruption

246
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,560
and uh being the like one of the

247
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,760
uh like a driver country doing business

248
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,399
like ratings and rankings but

249
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,160
you know the 21st century uh

250
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,720
authoritarian is

251
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,079
cannot be dissociated from the

252
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
kleptocracy

253
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
and as you are aware the kleptocracy

254
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,360
it's like a 21st century

255
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,720
business model where the oligarchs like

256
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,680
bedina even israeli is trying to get

257
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
all like a public institutions under his

258
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,319
control

259
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,120
and uh you you underlined this that

260
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,320
yes he's controlling the justice system

261
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
he's controlling

262
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,000
all judges and the prosecutors in this

263
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,439
country

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,040
uh but at this stage uh also he's

265
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,279
controlling some media

266
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:11,040
like tv companies and so but it's still

267
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:14,399
how to say fight uh and very important

268
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,560
fight be between this oligarchic system

269
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,399
and like a civil society

270
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,040
representatives because they until that

271
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,200
day the

272
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,160
civil society organizations they're

273
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,519
really

274
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,000
uh doing the great job in terms of to

275
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,440
bring

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
this all these cases to the public to

277
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,279
explain

278
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,760
this to the international level and uh

279
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,640
to to push back them but still the

280
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,839
situation

281
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,000
is very bad uh because the

282
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,640
as you know the kleptocracy is like a

283
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,320
well organized elite corruption

284
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,839
and has come to characterize this

285
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:58,160
russia and in a much post-communist like

286
00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:00,800
spaces and it's a main obstacle for

287
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,319
our democratic development and even for

288
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,680
economic growth

289
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,720
and uh as you are aware

290
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,680
it's uh he represents this

291
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,720
russian style oligarchic system in this

292
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,719
country

293
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,839
and the georgian society um

294
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,680
we think that he is

295
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:26,959
he is somehow the influentiated by the

296
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,079
influenced by the putin's regime because

297
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,680
whatever he is doing uh to undermine

298
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,959
georgian democracy

299
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,439
it only goes to the russian interest and

300
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,399
also

301
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
where we come now uh we came that the

302
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,880
georgia is

303
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,760
behind the offshore whale if you look

304
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,839
the

305
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,399
um how to say investment like a picture

306
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
where the main investors are coming in

307
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,399
georgia

308
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,519
even the minister of finance he admitted

309
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,040
that

310
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:02,160
70 percent of this uh uh interest

311
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,519
uh they are georgian related like

312
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,439
offshore based uh investments and from

313
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,079
since uh 2010 2018

314
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,440
there in georgia somewhere like a 5

315
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,160
billion

316
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,480
invest billion dollar investment came

317
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,319
from the offshore zone which is

318
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,519
related uh one single oligarch

319
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,800
and it's uh i think it's a

320
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,959
disaster and you know that uh we're

321
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:36,319
um like facing now that uh uh

322
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,959
the elections are coming uh very soon

323
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,680
end of october and because of the

324
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,880
coveted

325
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,359
19 pandemic situation

326
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,399
uh i don't know i think it will be very

327
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,279
difficult to get

328
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,000
international observers uh during the

329
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,519
election

330
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,320
or pre-election times because that uh

331
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,680
election uh in october it's gonna be a

332
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,800
lacmos

333
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,839
or test for the georgian democracy

334
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,839
uh because uh never happened and

335
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:11,120
we never faced that three times someone

336
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,240
someone came to the power and i believe

337
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,079
the georgian people

338
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,360
will will try their best

339
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:23,040
to to vote and to go to the elections

340
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:26,160
and to make their make their choices for

341
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,399
better and future uh georgia

342
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,240
which is going to be not kleptocratic or

343
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,360
oligarchy country but the

344
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,040
democratic and developed country and

345
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,920
will be one of the

346
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,839
uh like freedom fighters and the

347
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,959
democracy leaders in this region

348
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,760
thanks nino brian i wanted to ask you

349
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,560
about ukraine uh but let me preface my

350
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,399
question

351
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,760
by saying that one of the means by which

352
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,040
state capture occurs

353
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,160
is usually when the elite or the party

354
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,639
in power

355
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,680
begins to accumulate resources within

356
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
the government

357
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,519
they often use that for example

358
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,959
procurement contracts in hungary have

359
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,079
been a favored method

360
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,560
for enriching cronies of the regime and

361
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:14,399
those cronies then go on to buy

362
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,279
media assets uh other types of

363
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,320
companies that are beholden to the

364
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,399
government or do

365
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,160
business with the government and in this

366
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,160
way there's this closely sort of

367
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,560
interlocked system of control

368
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,519
over the economic and the political

369
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,000
arenas

370
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,000
now in ukraine you had something that

371
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,839
approximated state capture i would say

372
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,279
under victor yanukovych

373
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,600
but since then you've seen um

374
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,639
you haven't seen an end to kleptocracy

375
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,440
and you haven't seen an

376
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,399
end to corruption but you do see that

377
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,800
there are

378
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,120
different sort of oligarchic centers of

379
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,839
power the media universe for example in

380
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,720
ukraine

381
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,240
is controlled by on the one hand uh

382
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
renatakh met off on the other hand

383
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,320
dimitro fiertas on the other hand victor

384
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,440
medvedchuk

385
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,480
and others and so what are what are we

386
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,560
seeing in ukraine

387
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,920
is it state capture was there state

388
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,920
capture am i wrong about that

389
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,959
thanks mike i mean what i want to do is

390
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,839
actually to kind of reconceptualize this

391
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,560
a little bit

392
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,000
because i mean state capture is a term

393
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,800
that kind of was coined by the world

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,720
bank in 2000 to describe a trend where

395
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,240
form of taking place in former soviet

396
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,160
countries making the transit transition

397
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,760
from communism about the systemic

398
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,639
political corruption in which private

399
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,880
interests uh influence unduly influence

400
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,800
state decision making what we're

401
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,519
witnessing now goes a little bit beyond

402
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,758
that

403
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,199
um beyond this initial definition

404
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,959
because right now what we have our

405
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,319
private interests

406
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,959
in the service of another state

407
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,320
a hostile foreign power if you will

408
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,839
significantly influence the state's

409
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
decision-making process

410
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,000
um in the former soviet space in eastern

411
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,519
europe that outside power is of

412
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,639
course russia um and as far as ukraine

413
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,880
goes

414
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,680
in terms of both definitions of state

415
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,920
capture the

416
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,599
traditional one and the kind of twists

417
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,599
that i just added to it

418
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,279
um as far as ukraine goes there's always

419
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,639
been this debate of whether the glass is

420
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,680
half empty or half

421
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,320
full uh the good news in ukraine

422
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,839
has always been that you had as you

423
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,800
pointed out correctly mike

424
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,639
oligarchic pluralism if you will um

425
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,880
you've had a competition

426
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,959
among different oligarchy groups and

427
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,279
this is translated to

428
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,399
a greater degree of pluralism in in the

429
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,959
political system

430
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,880
now the bad news in ukraine has always

431
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,800
been and continues to be

432
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,519
that russia continues to have its

433
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,560
fingers in different oligarchic

434
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,680
pies and is always able to to to

435
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,000
to to have some degree of influence over

436
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,800
over the political um over the political

437
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
system

438
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,160
the you're correct that ukraine was

439
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
veering

440
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,240
very dangerously toward state capture

441
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,199
under victor yanukovych and it moved

442
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
away from

443
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,199
it to a degree not entirely

444
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,240
under pedro poroshenko um under vladimir

445
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,720
zelinski i'm

446
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,760
right now i am at the moment and this

447
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,679
can change

448
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,879
um but at the moment i'm veering towards

449
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,000
the the glass

450
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,559
being half empty right now because i see

451
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
a lot of

452
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,160
trends that i i actually find quite

453
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,439
disturbing

454
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,079
um a recent audit of

455
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,919
of ukraine and i'm quoting said grand

456
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,639
corruption and state capture remained

457
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,960
pervasive and systemic in ukraine

458
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,640
and no real change can take place

459
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,080
without tackling them

460
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,160
in depth um zielinski has been very

461
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,520
timid about attempting to re to say the

462
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,360
least about reforming

463
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,440
the prosecutor's office or law

464
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,439
enforcement or the sbu

465
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,799
so we have not seen the re the state

466
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
reform that we've needed

467
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,080
but also when you're looking at the

468
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,320
situation with the oligarchs

469
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,559
um you are seeing renat akhmetov's

470
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,200
influence increasing dramatically right

471
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,960
now

472
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,240
under zielinski and russia has

473
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,520
historically

474
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,400
worked through the the dunbas oligarchs

475
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,240
um right now ahmeta controls two-thirds

476
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,240
of ukraine's coal power and close to a

477
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,600
fifth of its renewables

478
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,080
and he was influential in steering the

479
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,799
state

480
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,559
away from nuclear and toward coal and

481
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,600
renewables where surprise surprise he

482
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,320
has most of his

483
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,760
his his um his control um ighar

484
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,760
khalomoysky

485
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,000
allegedly according to ukrainian press

486
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,080
reports allegedly made money by selling

487
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
coal from russia and russia and occupied

488
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,799
territories in eastern ukraine

489
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,760
um to the state-controlled energy

490
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,400
companies

491
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,000
central america so you're seeing even

492
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,559
kolomoisky who was seen as an

493
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,960
anti-russian oligarch

494
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,240
who who has who has a lot of a lot of

495
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
ties to russia

496
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,480
and medvedchuk um you mentioned machuk

497
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,840
was of course a pro-kremlin politician

498
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,000
in oligarch

499
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,480
he reportedly has about a quarter

500
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,720
percent stake in ukraine's most popular

501
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,160
tv channel one plus one according to you

502
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,120
according to ukrainian

503
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,039
press reports moreover you see russian

504
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,159
financial institutions like spiribank

505
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,240
and vab

506
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
remaining very act in a very active part

507
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,200
of ukraine's financial landscape

508
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,679
and therefore key vectors of influence

509
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,240
so

510
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,320
again the situation is mixed in ukraine

511
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,919
the oligarchic pluralism

512
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,960
kind of prevents one oligarchic clan

513
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,960
from capturing the state in ukraine

514
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,440
and it translates into a degree of

515
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,200
political pluralism but it also allows

516
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,200
the hostile outside power because we

517
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,039
have state state capture here it's

518
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,080
another state capturing another state

519
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,879
through private

520
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,280
private sectors or attempting to um

521
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,559
russia is able to keep its finger in a

522
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,760
lot of oligarchy

523
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,320
pies and is playing a very long game

524
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,280
in ukraine aimed at establishing its

525
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,840
goals without

526
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,480
even the need for a hot war in the long

527
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,678
term

528
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,679
it's able to undermine ukraine's uh

529
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,799
democratic institutions and prevent it

530
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,400
from becoming

531
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,559
a fully functioning democracy so

532
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,720
i mean going forward what we need to

533
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,520
know about ukraine is the degree to

534
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,960
which

535
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,760
ukraine's oligarchs are still invested

536
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,600
in in in in russia because like i said

537
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,158
there are two levels of state capture

538
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,240
here

539
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,640
one would be a problem all by itself if

540
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,400
there were no russia but when you add

541
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,039
the russian factor onto this

542
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,640
and this i would add is also i see this

543
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,440
problem repeating itself not just in

544
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,840
ukraine

545
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,120
but in georgia and moldova and elsewhere

546
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,918
in europe as

547
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,639
well so and i'll be glad to expand

548
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,640
anything in mind

549
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,559
i i that's the point you raise i want to

550
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,240
pivot from this point

551
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,678
because i want to leave enough time we

552
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,840
have a short discussion to get to the

553
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,679
solutions of how you undo state capture

554
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,360
but on this geopolitical point that

555
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,159
you've just raised and that nino touched

556
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,719
on as well

557
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,799
in fact all of you have uh of outside

558
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,720
powers and principally russia

559
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,080
utilizing state capture to be able to

560
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,799
channel its influence into these

561
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,039
countries

562
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,840
but i wanted to ask maya because

563
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,200
vladimir putin was seen in the west

564
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,760
as a pro-western oligarch

565
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,760
he presided over a system of tremendous

566
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
state capture as you yourself said

567
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,840
especially with the local officials with

568
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,440
the mayors who were told you know you

569
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,240
don't get a new school or a new

570
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,039
kindergarten

571
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,159
or a new senior center unless you join

572
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,480
the ruling party

573
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,240
and if you don't there will be unmarked

574
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,280
cards that trail you

575
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,320
24 7 and intimidate your family members

576
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,760
and you know i spoke

577
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,520
have spoken to local officials in

578
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,080
moldova who have

579
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,679
cried shed tears in my presence because

580
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,280
they've been so stressed out by this

581
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,240
pressure that was put upon them

582
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,960
so you have this system of state capture

583
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
and yet it's

584
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,120
it appeared to many in the west that it

585
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,200
was pro-western was that the case

586
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,639
or was it manipulated behind the scenes

587
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
in a direction that was not quite so

588
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,360
pro-western

589
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,880
well definitely it was a manipulation by

590
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,760
blackwood nuke

591
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,480
but he managed to get some support from

592
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,360
some people

593
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,400
in the west uh by doing so he

594
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,799
discredited

595
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
the uh you know the western model of

596
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,799
development and

597
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,240
pro-european way of moldova and this was

598
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,600
very upsetting

599
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,760
uh by doing that he was trying to divide

600
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,199
the country and to diminish the

601
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,679
resistance against

602
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,159
his regime in moldova but then at the

603
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,200
end of his story here

604
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,960
uh we saw uh video

605
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,039
uh recordings where he was negotiating

606
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,799
with the don the federalization of the

607
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,400
country which is something

608
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,400
which is the kind of the solution that

609
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,400
russia is uh

610
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,799
suggesting for the transmission conflict

611
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,400
and it's something that we do not accept

612
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,280
which uh is a proof in the end that

613
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,840
uh what mattered for him was money and

614
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,678
power

615
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,320
and it was not about the west or the

616
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,960
east it was about himself and about his

617
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,439
interests but unfortunately he did use

618
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,679
the

619
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,960
pro-european uh rhetoric to try to

620
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,919
cover for the abuses that that he was uh

621
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,280
making but with kind of a pro-european

622
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,200
he could be

623
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,360
when he uh was uh just taking people's

624
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,080
businesses putting them in prison

625
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,520
uh putting i mean opening criminal files

626
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,240
against mayors

627
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,559
uh arresting opposition and so on so of

628
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,440
course this would just go against

629
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,399
everything that the eu and the west

630
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,280
promotes

631
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,200
but this made our fight against him more

632
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,440
difficult because he was using

633
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,600
uh the geopolitics in his favor

634
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,039
great thank you so now i want to pivot a

635
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,399
little bit and turn to some of the

636
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,120
solutions since we have

637
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,559
uh so little time left so i'm going to

638
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,918
start with you brian

639
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,360
um and then i'm going to turn to nino uh

640
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,799
we have

641
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,559
nato eu countries where

642
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,720
we see state capture i'm thinking of

643
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,000
hungary and bulgaria as the two

644
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,360
primary examples so if large

645
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,440
international blocks of democracies

646
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,959
cannot prevent this from happening

647
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,720
within their ranks

648
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,000
it would seem that it would be much

649
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,440
harder for a country like moldova

650
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,760
which is sort of nestled between russia

651
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,679
and its influence and yet not fully

652
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,440
integrated into euro-atlantic structures

653
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,039
to be able to break out of this

654
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,440
stranglehold

655
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,879
what can and and i want to turn to some

656
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,000
of the local solutions in a second

657
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,559
that's what i'm going to ask you about

658
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,640
you know

659
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,720
but what should nato and the eu

660
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,679
and the west more broadly the united

661
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,919
states and its european allies be doing

662
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,640
um to shape the field so that this

663
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,640
doesn't happen

664
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,320
oh thanks mike i mean this is something

665
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,320
i've actually been thinking quite

666
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,600
a bit about and i can go through a

667
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,200
laundry list of

668
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,120
of things like better laws that are

669
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,720
beneficial ownership for example

670
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,600
um and and greater transparency on on

671
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,400
on oligarchic structures ties to foreign

672
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,559
powers

673
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,039
um better foreign agent registration

674
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,678
laws but i think mike the root of this

675
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,559
problem

676
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,919
actually we have to go back to the to

677
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,039
the early 90s

678
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,320
and the moment of quote-unquote victory

679
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,158
in the cold war

680
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,080
and i think the seeds of the current

681
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,360
crisis right now

682
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,840
were planted at that time um if you go

683
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,918
back to the late 80s early 90s

684
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,879
in the west the dominant ideology if you

685
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,400
will

686
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,600
was this laissez-faire neo-liberal

687
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,080
reaganite thatcherite

688
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,360
perspective that is a legitimate part of

689
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
the western policy i'm not making a

690
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,918
political statement here this is a

691
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,039
legitimate part of the

692
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:51,039
of the western political uh tradition

693
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,520
right but at that moment this ideology

694
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,720
this

695
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,200
radical deregulation this radical

696
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,480
laissez-faire-ism

697
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,159
was seen as the ideology which won the

698
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,400
cold war and became

699
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,159
the key components of the of what became

700
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,880
known as the washington consensus

701
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,679
in the early 1990s this is the ideology

702
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,720
we

703
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,000
promoted to to to our new partners in

704
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,279
eastern europe

705
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,480
um and as a result we deregulated our

706
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,720
societies

707
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,480
to the point where there were these

708
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,080
gaping holes

709
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,480
that allowed a hostile foreign power

710
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,399
two decades later russia to be able to

711
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,279
exploit these holes so i think we have

712
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,640
to have

713
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,480
a new conversation about smart

714
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,880
regulation with an eye

715
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,520
toward toward national security because

716
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,960
i think we opened ourselves up to this

717
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,440
um in in in the early 90s with with with

718
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,360
the

719
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,000
with the the ideology that was dominant

720
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,879
at the time which we mistakenly thought

721
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,600
was the thing that won the cold war for

722
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,919
us when

723
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,678
in reality what won the cold war for us

724
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,760
was everywhere from roosevelt on the

725
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,440
left to reagan on the right the entire

726
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,000
gamut we needed it all

727
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,279
um and so i i think this this is

728
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,240
something we have to have a real

729
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,760
serious rethink about in the west and we

730
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,799
have to start looking

731
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,679
at regulation as a

732
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,200
as a national security uh concern in

733
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,960
terms of public policy

734
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,960
and start thinking about creative ways

735
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,919
to do this there's obvious ways to do it

736
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,240
better laws and fight

737
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,120
on beneficial ownership for example is

738
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,520
is a way to go

739
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,120
because this isn't just a problem in the

740
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,000
obvious countries in

741
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,799
in in europe like like hungary or

742
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,880
bulgaria

743
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,158
but you also see it happening in

744
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,760
countries which are considered good

745
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,279
performers like the czech republic

746
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,000
for example so i think this is something

747
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,320
we we have to pay a lot of attention to

748
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,279
um even as far west as here in the

749
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,399
united states

750
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,520
um so that would be the way i i would i

751
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,879
would approach that we have to have a

752
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,360
kind of a radical rethink about the

753
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,360
paradigm

754
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,840
great thank you brian so nino you

755
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,360
mentioned civil society

756
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,120
uh earlier um and it seems to me there's

757
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,120
a couple different ways to break up

758
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,120
state capture and they all need to sort

759
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,320
of be vectors that are working in the

760
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,719
same direction

761
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,879
uh new opposition parties coming to

762
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,919
power that break up the structure of old

763
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,320
civil society that pushes from below

764
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,200
and then good laws and governance

765
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,879
institutions

766
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,080
that prevent some of these things that

767
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,640
we've just been talking about for the

768
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,240
last

769
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,240
uh 20 minutes from happening in the

770
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,559
first place but tell me about the role

771
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,520
of civil society because georgia has

772
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,760
uh to my mind one of the most active

773
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,480
energized civil societies

774
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,640
of any country in the region and it i'm

775
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,480
not just talking about the organizations

776
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,200
although those are also impressive like

777
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,840
your own

778
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,000
uh but also the sort of the people power

779
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,399
uh the ability of people to

780
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
turn out in the streets when they feel

781
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,959
that something is

782
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,640
unjust or the government is doing

783
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,039
something unfairly

784
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
um so talk a little bit about the role

785
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,279
of civil society

786
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,840
in pushing back against state capture

787
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,360
and oligarchy

788
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,279
thank you so much mike for these

789
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,760
questions because the you know that

790
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,720
there is no easy ways to break up this

791
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,000
system

792
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,679
and the civil society of georgia

793
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,039
i mean the uh like a well-established

794
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,159
civil society

795
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,039
and media as well uh they were doing a

796
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,919
great job

797
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,799
in terms of bringing this like you know

798
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,720
the

799
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,600
attention of the international uh our

800
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,320
strategic partners on these issues and

801
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,360
um

802
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,840
it's very sad that georgia came to the

803
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,240
like

804
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,959
first time into the senate like a

805
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,520
decrees and the statements that

806
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,240
georgian government is not doing well in

807
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,760
terms of

808
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,880
uh defending the international like

809
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:52,240
foreign direct investment and also the

810
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,399
uh in terms of democracy their

811
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,760
tax sliding and the role of civil

812
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:00,799
society in this

813
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:04,000
regard was very important because

814
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,399
we ourselves well organized

815
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
this fight or push back to the

816
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,520
oligarchic system

817
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,720
because we think that this oligarchy

818
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,918
oligarchy

819
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,039
is um how to say issue of our national

820
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,200
security

821
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,799
and uh because this undermining the

822
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,000
georgian democracy

823
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:28,000
uh to be a democratic country is like a

824
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,600
main uh how to say uh main idea for

825
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,720
georgia because uh

826
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,399
uh why the our strategic partners

827
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,440
and uh eli's loved or supporting the

828
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,399
georgia because

829
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,120
uh because we were always fighting for

830
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,158
this

831
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,639
values and their freedom in this region

832
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,240
and we were like you know the trend

833
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,960
setters in this region

834
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,799
and to giving an example to the rest of

835
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,279
our neighbors or in the

836
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,279
like countries in the region that if

837
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,320
georgia was going to be surviving this

838
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,720
battle then

839
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,559
other countries also will follow uh

840
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,760
follow us

841
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,678
and if you go to the like if you see the

842
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,720
last polls or whatever

843
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,760
um i mean the main part of the georgian

844
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,200
society

845
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,158
uh more than 80 percent there still for

846
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,880
uh georgia's euro atlantic integration

847
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,240
and

848
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,480
this support mainly done um

849
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,880
by georgian uh non-governmental

850
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,000
organization and the civil society

851
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,919
uh because uh we were just like

852
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,919
going everywhere in rural areas and

853
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:40,399
spreading this information and

854
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,039
not fighting uh against the russian

855
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,080
disinformation with the

856
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:49,679
again the propaganda but just on

857
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,039
time proposing the true and

858
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,399
we think that the role of civil society

859
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,039
in terms again

860
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,799
to pushing back to kleptocratic system

861
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,000
or oligarchic system

862
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,279
uh i'm um like a

863
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,279
very hopeful on on this regard that uh

864
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,200
we're gonna to intensify

865
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:14,399
our like watchdog function during the

866
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:18,320
election or pre-election time and

867
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:21,439
for us again uh to to break up this

868
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,039
system is very important to our

869
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,000
strategic partners uh support because

870
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,000
you know that you cannot deal with the

871
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,399
anonymous ownership

872
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,600
inside of this small country because

873
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,879
it's a big

874
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,519
uh like a systematic problems and uh

875
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,760
i still believe that world and

876
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,880
especially the democratic world

877
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,480
should be uniting their efforts to fight

878
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,600
against this uh

879
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,640
uh you know the systematic kleptocracy

880
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,639
all around the world

881
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,000
great and it's now uh come time to uh

882
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,000
take questions from the audience and

883
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,679
we've already got one i encourage other

884
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,799
people to submit questions

885
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,640
um in the chat box but before i turn to

886
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,840
that one question i wanna

887
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,159
just wrap up with maya sandhu and ask

888
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,039
you

889
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,640
about the politics of this and and just

890
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,240
i'm going to be very blunt

891
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,640
if you do win um in november

892
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,039
um how are you going to take apart this

893
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
system of state capture in moldova what

894
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,480
what are the key elements that

895
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,600
you would put in place to ensure that

896
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,600
this never happens again

897
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,519
well this is about building strong and

898
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,399
independent institutions

899
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,360
and this is very difficult to do we all

900
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,879
know

901
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,678
uh we failed to build a strong state

902
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,760
over the last three decades uh but uh

903
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,039
this is the the only way forward and

904
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,200
this is what we tried to do last year uh

905
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,240
in the five months that we had when i

906
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,960
was

907
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,240
prime minister uh and i had a really

908
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,360
good team

909
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,559
um but the moment we started to deliver

910
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,039
so the moment we started to to promote

911
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,000
the right people in this institutions

912
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,359
that was the moment

913
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,879
when the oligarchic forces got together

914
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,359
again and then they dismissed the

915
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,399
government the idea is that in the

916
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,879
presidential office

917
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,839
you have more time than than as prime

918
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,918
minister

919
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,040
because the life of the prime minister

920
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,799
can be very short

921
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,040
but it's not going to be easy you have

922
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,200
to start you have to prioritize you have

923
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,879
to start with the institutions

924
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:33,118
that matter the most and um

925
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,759
i believe that the most important is

926
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,280
justice because all these oligarchs

927
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,879
um they want to control first of all

928
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,119
justice because they don't want to be

929
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,440
punished they don't want to be stopped

930
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,000
and this is how it happened in our cases

931
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,079
in our case so it was judges prosecutors

932
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,679
and this is where we need to start uh

933
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,560
the reform

934
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,000
it's not an easy reform sometimes what

935
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,960
the international community

936
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,240
advises in terms of the legal framework

937
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,880
might not be

938
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,879
the best for the specific country in the

939
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,359
specific situation for instance

940
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,040
during blackwood news times um the

941
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,799
international community

942
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,160
kind of promoted the law and it was

943
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,359
adopted but it didn't help

944
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,279
it is an ideal law on paper but for our

945
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,240
specific situation

946
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,280
even though it said no political uh

947
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,759
interference

948
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,960
prosecutors promote other prosecutors

949
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,359
prosecutors from

950
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,880
within the system um select the

951
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,598
prosecutor general

952
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,320
but blackwood knew would use you know uh

953
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,960
different

954
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,440
uh instruments he would just go to these

955
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,079
people

956
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,599
to to the people with integrity to the

957
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,720
prosecutors with integrity they would

958
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,079
just go to his

959
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,560
families uh and then uh try to

960
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,200
uh you know intimidate them and tell

961
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,839
them

962
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,720
not to uh run for one position or

963
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,279
another so

964
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,200
it doesn't help um but it has to be

965
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,480
about this reform and i know that

966
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,799
the eu for instance and other

967
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,200
institutions other development partners

968
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,680
are trying to help some countries in the

969
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,240
region with the justice sector reform

970
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,200
um there should be i don't know there

971
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,879
should be a more

972
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,000
bold kind of attitude uh because all of

973
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,160
us here in the region

974
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,359
need to clean up the system there should

975
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,759
be uh

976
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,440
opening for cleaning up the prosecution

977
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,160
and the justice because otherwise we'll

978
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,200
never get

979
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,359
uh to have strong institutions so i

980
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,160
would start with the uh

981
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,359
the security um issues and the

982
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,200
institutions which are

983
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,200
supposed to provide security for the

984
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,720
country and then with the prosecution

985
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,799
with the justice sector

986
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,399
and then from there uh it would be

987
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,000
easier to move to

988
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,839
to the other institutions state

989
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
institutions and to

990
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,920
make them independents and to strengthen

991
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,520
them

992
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,640
great thank you so much so i understand

993
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,320
we have a live question from the

994
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,839
audience i'm going to turn to the studio

995
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,839
to to have the question asked

996
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,720
hi it's ian bond from the center for

997
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,920
european reform in london

998
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,759
um i mean in the old days

999
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,599
the west had quite a lot of leverage

1000
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,320
because of its financial muscle

1001
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,040
in these countries you now have china

1002
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,079
with the belt and road initiative

1003
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,040
is there a risk that

1004
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,040
china can basically offer no strings

1005
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,119
attached to financing

1006
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,240
and that that undercuts the um the

1007
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,520
traditional leverage

1008
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,078
and i think there's some evidence of

1009
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,240
this already in the western balkans

1010
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,359
but i wonder whether it's happening also

1011
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,040
in the

1012
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,119
the former soviet space that um

1013
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,320
if you go to the ebrd or others and they

1014
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,680
say well you know we're going to set

1015
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,960
these tough conditions on

1016
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,040
good governance you simply turn to

1017
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:50,960
beijing and beijing says sure how much

1018
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:54,160
do you want

1019
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,160
who would like to take that

1020
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,800
there have been questions there have

1021
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,160
been discussions in moldova but i

1022
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,359
haven't

1023
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:09,200
sorry go ahead maya go ahead

1024
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,200
so i was trying to say that

1025
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,200
oops sorry uh it's not happening in

1026
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,078
moldova yet there have been some

1027
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,480
discussions

1028
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,240
in moldova the current government has

1029
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,640
been trying to replace

1030
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,078
the uh western support by russian

1031
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,560
support

1032
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,240
but the discussion on 200 million

1033
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,200
dollars has been

1034
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,118
there for half a year now and it's not

1035
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,960
clear whether this is just

1036
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,160
an empty promise where this is going to

1037
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,200
happen so

1038
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,399
in our case uh russia is being presented

1039
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,839
as an alternative

1040
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,839
not china

1041
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,440
yeah just i i just wanted to add some

1042
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,480
like a point that uh

1043
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,160
as you are aware georgia signed the

1044
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,040
agreement with china a few years ago

1045
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,240
and to get the free trade agreement with

1046
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,560
the china

1047
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,720
but still there there is no like a

1048
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,839
significant rise of the china

1049
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,240
investment in our country and uh

1050
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,520
it's the same situation here i agree

1051
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,078
with maya that

1052
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,520
in georgia it's also like a more

1053
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,440
dominant as a russian

1054
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,920
influence china influence it's not

1055
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,800
at least at this time we're not facing

1056
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,119
this this

1057
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,119
problem

1058
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,760
i mean i i would just add uh very

1059
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,520
briefly

1060
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,359
as i was listening to ian's excellent

1061
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,880
question i was recalling a conversation

1062
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,839
i had with a georgian official some

1063
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,200
years back

1064
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,040
when he was describing to me the

1065
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,480
difference in dealing with the west

1066
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,320
and the russians when it comes to

1067
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,880
finance and he said the with the west

1068
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,560
the magic word is transparency

1069
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,400
with the russians the magic word is

1070
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,240
kickback and i was

1071
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
as i was listening to ian's question i

1072
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,078
was thinking what is the magic word

1073
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,200
with china right now um and i i'm afraid

1074
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,079
i don't have a

1075
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,960
an immediate answer to that question um

1076
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,599
and

1077
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,880
but i i would i would suspect it is uh

1078
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,359
some degree of political

1079
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,359
control

1080
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,599
great okay so we have another uh

1081
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,200
question here

1082
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,839
uh from the audience i'm gonna read it

1083
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,680
it's from andre matishak

1084
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,000
and it says in central and eastern

1085
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,640
europe we probably know a thing or two

1086
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,319
about state capture we were happy to

1087
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,319
receive help from the u.s

1088
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,000
but and i am being deliberately

1089
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,079
provocative he says

1090
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,400
watching donald trump using the white

1091
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,640
house like his political prop

1092
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,440
maybe we should advise americans on how

1093
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,440
to fight state capture don't you think

1094
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,960
and of course it seems that trump can be

1095
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,160
an example for

1096
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,200
all aspiring state capturists around the

1097
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,118
world

1098
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,480
and he is taking something from their

1099
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,119
playbooks

1100
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,240
uh well as moderator i'm very tempted to

1101
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,160
answer this question but

1102
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,160
um that's not my prerogative so i'm

1103
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,040
gonna i'm gonna turn this to you brian

1104
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,160
and let you

1105
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,160
uh let you answer

1106
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,879
i mean you know i wish i could just

1107
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,240
dismiss that as what about ism but i'm

1108
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,960
afraid in the current environment i

1109
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,919
cannot

1110
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,480
um and what happens here in the united

1111
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,520
states

1112
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,720
matters a lot um in the example that is

1113
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,759
set here

1114
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,359
matters a lot and i i mean i

1115
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
i i have a hard time arguing with the

1116
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,119
sentiment

1117
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,560
expressed by the by the questioner and

1118
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,160
it just goes to show you that the

1119
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,799
problem of state capture is not

1120
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,759
something

1121
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,760
that is just isolated to our to our

1122
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,400
friends and partners in eastern europe

1123
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,760
um but is is something we have to to to

1124
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,680
to worry about here

1125
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,040
it also illustrates something else to me

1126
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,118
and if something i've always said is

1127
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,680
that we in the west

1128
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,920
need to pay very very very close

1129
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,640
attention to what is happening

1130
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,200
in the former soviet states of eastern

1131
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,480
europe

1132
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,118
because what the russians attempt to do

1133
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,359
there

1134
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,720
is an example of what they will try to

1135
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,640
do to us tomorrow

1136
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,640
it's always a harbinger so i think that

1137
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,560
i i i find it very hard

1138
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,078
to to to argue with the questioner's

1139
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,000
sentiment it's something i

1140
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,319
it's something i'm as an american

1141
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,720
citizen i'm deeply concerned about

1142
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,079
um and that this is a problem that is

1143
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,680
global in nature it's not just an

1144
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,000
eastern european problem

1145
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,879
um i've long liked to say and people

1146
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,960
have heard me say

1147
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,079
corruption is the new communism and we

1148
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,480
have to we have to be

1149
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,760
just as vigilant about guarding against

1150
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,560
its spread

1151
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,040
um as we were about communism during the

1152
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,359
during the cold war period

1153
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,800
but just to push you on this brian this

1154
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,680
is not something in the united states

1155
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,839
that is being

1156
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,240
perpetrated by russia against the united

1157
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,040
states this is homegrown this is

1158
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,160
donald trump and his entourage who are

1159
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,200
stacking the courts

1160
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,078
seeking to buy up media that are

1161
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,240
friendly to them

1162
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,440
and and promote them at the expense of

1163
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,078
others and it's

1164
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,920
the use of intelligence and law

1165
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,720
enforcement agencies for partisan

1166
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,800
purpose

1167
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,399
um and and you know there may be a

1168
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,920
russia angle there

1169
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,440
but this is not something that is being

1170
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,200
done by russia it's being done by

1171
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,359
americans

1172
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,480
uh you're right mike and i would argue

1173
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,279
these two things are not

1174
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,720
are not mutually exclusive at all um

1175
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,240
this you can have something that is

1176
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,560
homegrown

1177
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,000
and that the results of that homegrown

1178
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,160
phenomenon

1179
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,760
can also benefit russia

1180
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,520
geopolitically um just like the

1181
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,599
situation in ukraine

1182
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,520
where you have a lot of corruption which

1183
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,079
isn't necessarily being directed at

1184
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,560
russia

1185
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,800
but it results in a dysfunctional system

1186
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,799
that is geopolitically beneficial to

1187
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,319
russia so i don't i don't see these

1188
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,160
this question of whether something is

1189
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,640
homegrown or whether

1190
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,799
it is being exploited from moscow or

1191
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,440
from any hostile foreign power for that

1192
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,280
matter

1193
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,880
i don't see these two these two things

1194
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,359
as mutually exclusive i see these two

1195
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,640
things

1196
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,880
as happening simultaneously okay

1197
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,560
great um last question here we have to

1198
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,760
wrap up in about two minutes

1199
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,960
uh this is from maxime hilco uh it's

1200
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,960
question for you brian

1201
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,800
uh although i think it's relevant uh to

1202
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,720
both moldova and george as well

1203
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,240
uh so i'm gonna have you answer very

1204
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,078
quickly and then i'll give

1205
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,279
final words to nino and maya but the

1206
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,520
question is this

1207
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,960
what can be done in ukraine and in other

1208
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,400
countries of the region

1209
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,640
to turn our oligarchs into normal strong

1210
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,920
businessmen will make our country more

1211
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,480
resilient and not

1212
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,240
weaker under russian pressure so i'll

1213
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,640
start with you brian and then you nino

1214
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,919
and then

1215
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,920
uh maya you have the last word

1216
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,240
i mean i i i think this the the answer

1217
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,280
is both simple and complicated i mean

1218
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,439
you have to establish a system in which

1219
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,800
the rule of law applies to everybody and

1220
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,640
you have to draw a

1221
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,560
and this has often been talked about

1222
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,078
draw a line at one point with these

1223
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,400
oligarchs and say

1224
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,079
what you got up until now we're not

1225
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,040
going to be digging into the past

1226
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,680
from this moment on you will play by the

1227
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,400
rules now no ukrainian leader has

1228
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,240
ever ever been able to do that i had

1229
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,920
great hopes for pedro bonashenko being

1230
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,520
an oligarch himself

1231
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,200
that he would have been able to he would

1232
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,880
have been able to carry this message

1233
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,319
but he was unable to do it but it's a

1234
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,079
question of leadership and i don't see

1235
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,000
any evidence under zelinski

1236
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,760
of this of this is this happening in

1237
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
ukraine so but but it's

1238
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,920
so it's it's the answer is simple

1239
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,720
establish the rule of law for all

1240
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,000
and enforce the rule of law for all uh

1241
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,879
but nobody has been able to do

1242
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,119
that up until now okay we've we've got

1243
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,280
about uh 30 seconds left for each of you

1244
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,079
nino you first

1245
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,160
yeah i i i don't believe the oligarchic

1246
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,640
democracy you know and i don't believe

1247
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,078
that these people can change their

1248
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:54,480
totalitarian mindset or russian like a

1249
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:57,520
system of thinking uh because

1250
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,640
i still believe that that you know that

1251
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,680
they were damaged so much during this

1252
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,839
soviet time you know only way and only

1253
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:09,118
like a language they know that

1254
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:12,078
to kill to gain to like a bribe

1255
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,560
or to kill the people and i don't think

1256
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,760
that

1257
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,480
it's only way uh to resolve this problem

1258
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,200
to set

1259
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,920
the international you know the system

1260
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,319
fighting

1261
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,280
against the kleptocratic and oligarchic

1262
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,000
regimes

1263
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,240
all around the world and it's important

1264
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,200
to develop the rhetoric about this

1265
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,479
kleptocracy oligarchy as a cultural and

1266
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,680
the moral issue

1267
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,720
and to expand extend this magnitsky

1268
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,319
act also uh to include

1269
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,799
the uh all around the world this

1270
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,520
oligarchs you know in terms if they try

1271
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,520
to

1272
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:52,640
uh to taking the state or to be in a

1273
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,119
state capture position and taking the

1274
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,118
country

1275
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,040
thank you last word to you my once an

1276
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:04,480
oligarch always an oligarch

1277
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,480
yes i don't believe in the re-education

1278
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,200
of the oligarchs either

1279
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,880
and in all cases not this is not an

1280
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,480
issue we have a few of them we need to

1281
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,640
get them out of power

1282
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,000
we need to punish them so there is no

1283
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,200
discussion about

1284
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,920
uh amnesty somebody who uh

1285
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,240
stole 12 percent of gdp just in one shot

1286
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,640
this

1287
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,160
is not the discussion but as i said we

1288
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,359
don't have many of them we just need to

1289
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,839
make sure that we

1290
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,119
take all from power and then that we

1291
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,279
don't admit

1292
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,240
that others come and do the same so the

1293
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,800
answer is rule of law

1294
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,839
