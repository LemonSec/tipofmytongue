european policy institute in brussels

66
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,120
it's a great panel so i'm going to start

67
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,319
by asking

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,080
a couple questions and let

69
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,280
our panelists jump in as they like

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
it strikes me as we talk about covid and

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,159
the potential

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,519
to change the european union you could

73
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,560
look at it from

74
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,120
two sides one in a

75
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,599
possibly optimistic way you look at the

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,519
recovery fund and the seven year

77
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,760
multi multi-annual budget and you say

78
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,680
see the germans have given in and

79
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,200
there's a kind of collective debt

80
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,680
and this sets a model for the future um

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,599
maybe or maybe it's a one-off and it'll

82
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,720
never happen again

83
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,879
but there is a gesture of solidarity

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,959
but on the other side perhaps you look

85
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,798
at what's happening to schengen

86
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,000
if you live in belgium you can't go to

87
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,040
paris there's

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,040
quarantines everywhere the idea of open

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,760
borders has been breaking down

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,280
and some wonder whether it will ever

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,720
come back again

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,080
um so nicole let's

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,599
start with you which is it is the glass

94
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,280
fuller or is it emptier on european

95
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,519
development and cohesion um

96
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,559
thanks steven and it's great to be here

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
and and uh

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
thanks for everyone uh thanks to

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,199
everyone for watching well i would i

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,400
would tend to see the glass was half

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,520
full to be honest

102
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,198
and especially um if compared to

103
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,320
the previous crises that the eu has

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,040
dealt with and has i think dealt with

105
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,840
with

106
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,960
much more difficulty and much more

107
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,758
disunity and much slower

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,880
speaking of migration crisis say or the

109
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,320
financial crisis

110
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,719
compared to this one uh and and also i

111
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,159
think

112
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,560
i would see the glass half pool of

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,759
compared to what we imagined could have

114
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,600
happened back in

115
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,280
back in march i remember here in

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,720
slovakia lots of people in journalists

117
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,840
asking well is the european union going

118
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,479
to break up

119
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,400
um because at the time there were there

120
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,758
were real fears that uh

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,239
given uh you know how we were unable to

122
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
how we were unable to help italy and how

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,320
uh there were all these

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,280
um all these discussions of how uh

125
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,680
crucial

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,719
uh material the building being held at

127
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
borders and stuff

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,800
i mean at the time it was lots of people

129
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,280
wondered what the edu will survive this

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,440
crisis

131
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,719
at all whether we would see the end of

132
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,759
schengen whether

133
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
uh where would we be you know deadlocked

134
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,320
on the

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,520
north versus south debate on corona

136
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,280
bones forever

137
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,799
uh and all that so so i think um you

138
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,198
know uh against that

139
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,120
benchmark i think the eu uh and this the

140
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,080
big story is that the resilience of

141
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,800
of the eu especially obviously i mean uh

142
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,000
pointing

143
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,880
to uh to to the recovery package uh but

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,280
but even so

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
if you if you compare the response uh

146
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,318
and the performance to

147
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,840
you know the us or or the uk even i

148
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,120
think the eu is doing much better than

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,159
we could have expected so that's the

150
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
sort of half

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,880
uh helpful whether the whether the

152
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
recovery package is going to be one-off

153
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,880
or or it's going to be here to stay i

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,799
mean obviously the size of it

155
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,960
is going to be a one-off uh that was the

156
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,160
trade-off that that's why actually the

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,440
um the frugals accepted it but there are

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
elements of it which might be

159
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,319
transformative

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,680
which might stay uh the most important

161
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,680
one being that

162
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
uh given that when we start borrowing

163
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,400
money on the financial markets as the

164
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,639
european union

165
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,758
i mean we also create a market for for

166
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,840
these eu bonds

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,120
and that can you know tends to have a

168
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,638
staying power

169
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
and the second will be the the debate

170
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
about own resources once

171
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,479
uh we actually develop uh eu's own

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,800
resources to pay down

173
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,318
to to pay for the for for this debt that

174
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
might stay on and the you might

175
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,960
might have a resources of its own and

176
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,719
that will outlive the recovery package

177
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,638
i think that's going to be a big fight

178
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,840
but not one for

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,639
this minute um own resources is going to

180
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,758
be a big

181
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,440
another big more south east-west issue

182
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,240
kinga i wondered what you thought

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,680
um you come from a country that

184
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,360
sometimes can be

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,800
skeptical about what brussels wants um

186
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,160
do you see kovitt bringing europe to

187
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,360
a new better place or somehow

188
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,599
showing its weaknesses or

189
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,479
fissures thank you very much and good

190
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
afternoon

191
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,479
also to to everyone as

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,080
steven said it's it's friday afternoon

193
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,800
on on august you can

194
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,359
partly blame me uh i was the one who was

195
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,560
participating in designing this trend of

196
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,160
more fragmentation of the eu and i was

197
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,879
just thinking may that maybe if you

198
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,560
would choose a

199
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,720
um title more powerful eu maybe we would

200
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,199
get to the first day of this conference

201
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
so

202
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,919
uh this i will have it in mind in in

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,840
shaping european topics in the future

204
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,758
uh but it also i think shows a little

205
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,479
bit the position of the eu and the

206
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,240
state of plate and decades of the

207
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,360
multiple crises that

208
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,080
eu has been um gone through um

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,000
i uh you stephen you were very

210
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,080
diplomatic in saying about poland

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and its euros skepticism sometimes

212
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,560
but i would say when i was preparing for

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,680
this panel i i read some polls and i was

214
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,800
trying to um

215
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,599
to learn what are the feelings of the

216
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,599
people

217
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,759
and actually from the recent poor in

218
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,319
june from the european parliament

219
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,399
there were two words that feelings that

220
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,760
the europeans

221
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,039
feel uh associate with which is the

222
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,279
hope and uncertainty and i think this is

223
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,399
also how reflects uh the state of the

224
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,040
union today

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,680
we hope that this rescue package will

226
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,880
help

227
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,479
us to go through the crisis and file

228
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,959
and wish for more solidarity but then

229
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
also

230
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,479
we are not sure about the future of

231
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,519
european uh project

232
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,560
and the covet 19 showed us that nothing

233
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,920
about the eu

234
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,160
is irreversible in and inevitable

235
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,959
and also about the givens country

236
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,760
participation in the european project

237
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,239
to my view it is really it's possible

238
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,839
that

239
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,320
um in the long term uh the eu

240
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,680
as it is now the current architecture

241
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,279
will become a

242
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,719
more loose intergovernmental project

243
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,800
but there will be a core and um

244
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,839
there will be member states that they

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,120
will build

246
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,160
um political union that will uh be

247
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,880
um able and willing to delegate more

248
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,560
power

249
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,160
to to brussels where there are multiple

250
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,000
reasons for that

251
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,880
i will maybe uh give one example

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,800
everyone is talking about the budget and

253
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,839
for example now the commission

254
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,959
said that uh in poland certain

255
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,160
cities or municipalities that do not

256
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,040
treat equally or minorities will not

257
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,439
receive the funds what happened is

258
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,560
that the polish government said that if

259
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,760
the eu does not

260
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,920
um give does not give money

261
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,399
we will just triple that amount and a

262
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,040
given city or municipality will receive

263
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,920
it

264
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,240
so my biggest fear is that regardless

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,959
all

266
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,760
punishments or or measures coming from

267
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,920
brussels

268
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,360
there might be governments saying that

269
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,479
and

270
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,160
what's the problem um we we don't care

271
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,680
if we even we can hope the eu

272
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,800
so a little bit of pessimistic scenario

273
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,959
but this is how i feel this summer about

274
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,719
the eu

275
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,319
very good thank you no because i mean

276
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,440
this is one of the great debates

277
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,040
that is always going on i mean which is

278
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,480
where is europe going and where's its

279
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,399
heading and will it die

280
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,800
and will it you know i don't think it

281
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,480
will die i'm a big optimist

282
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,839
but it can't stay the same and so this

283
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,760
is one of these

284
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,600
questions heather i'm going to come to

285
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,040
you now that you're

286
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,399
hooked up before you disappear again um

287
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,519
whether you think this this is a moment

288
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:20,240
where the eu finds a new impetus

289
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,240
and rationale or something else

290
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,959
sure um well it's this is always the

291
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
question after every crisis

292
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,518
and every crisis that the eu

293
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,640
faces um becomes an existential one

294
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,560
because the expectations for the eu

295
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,560
being able to coordinate a response are

296
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,599
always so much higher than its capacity

297
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,599
to do so

298
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,959
because the eu was not set up it wasn't

299
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,600
designed as a rapid response mechanism

300
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,880
it's a slow-moving uh often lowest

301
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,440
common denominator

302
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,560
club of sovereign countries which are

303
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,720
quite keen to

304
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
do things in an intergovernmental way as

305
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,240
king i was just pointing out

306
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,439
um and it's it simply doesn't respond

307
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,680
with a decisive executive action

308
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,680
because it its member states have never

309
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,880
wanted it to be able to take decisive

310
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,040
executive action

311
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,480
above their heads they they want all of

312
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,760
the member states to be involved and

313
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,839
they they want uh

314
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,040
to ensure that that every government has

315
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,120
a say uh

316
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,839
in the critical moments of response so i

317
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
think it's done pretty well in the

318
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
circumstances

319
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,440
um but it's never going to be stellar

320
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,160
and it always leads to disappointment

321
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,880
but what the eu is very good at is

322
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,439
setting up

323
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,240
enduring policy frameworks which

324
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
establish

325
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,639
rules of the game and establish

326
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,439
mechanisms for cooperation

327
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,720
which often do manage to to survive the

328
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,320
crisis and so

329
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,760
i think the new impotence that you were

330
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,720
just asking about steve

331
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,279
will be in the domain of uh ensuring

332
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,959
that

333
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,439
uh countries both uh have more um

334
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,439
access to resources at eu level and so

335
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,800
the the arguments about resources about

336
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,959
the budget and about

337
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,479
new conditionalities as well as new

338
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,439
funds that are available

339
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
will go hand in hand with also more

340
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,320
interest

341
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,480
in the governance of member states and

342
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,000
more concern for the eu level to have

343
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,760
oversight of those

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,440
because this crisis has been a very

345
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
different one from the one that started

346
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,120
in 2008 which was

347
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,560
started as a banking and financial

348
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
crisis and then became an economic

349
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,319
crisis

350
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,519
but which revealed uh problems in with

351
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,959
uh risk

352
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,639
in the financial sector in various

353
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,399
member states that clearly was not being

354
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,560
accounted for at eu level

355
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,000
this time we've seen risks in health

356
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,920
systems but also in many

357
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,760
other systems where there wasn't

358
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,800
actually all that nation and cooperation

359
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,279
between member states

360
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,079
so i think what will happen is uh the

361
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,480
eu's

362
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,839
increasing role in the governance at

363
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,959
national level

364
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,480
of uh key policies uh like health but

365
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,638
also economic policies

366
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,720
and increasingly rule of law these are

367
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,440
the areas which will endure after this

368
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,279
crisis

369
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,000
but uh i don't think we can expect to

370
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,399
see a fantastic rapid response mechanism

371
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
that will allow the eu to respond faster

372
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,160
to future pandemics than it has

373
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,399
responded to this one

374
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,760
right good thanks thank you i mean and

375
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
obviously

376
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,839
health was not an eu competence which

377
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,040
was part of the problem and part of the

378
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,160
fumbling

379
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,360
um and maybe it will be soon i mean

380
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,000
it seems like a good thing for the eu

381
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,079
let's say

382
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,120
to be working on finding a vaccine

383
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,079
paying for vaccines for everybody right

384
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,040
that kind of thing um seems um very

385
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,519
useful

386
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,959
stefan i want to turn to you you have

387
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,360
been watching the eu

388
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,959
for a really really long time you've

389
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,160
been up and down with it

390
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:48,239
you have your own sometimes

391
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,880
optimistic sometimes skeptical view

392
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
but i think of you as a great realist so

393
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,120
what is

394
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,720
what does realism tell you today about

395
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,680
what the virus does to the eu

396
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,000
thank you and good afternoon to everyone

397
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,519
well

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,240
i i consider the recovery fund as a huge

399
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,279
achievement

400
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,000
a great sign of hope but i still see

401
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,000
the dynamic of fragmentation and the

402
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
risk of fragmentation that is quite

403
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,560
serious

404
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,880
that give you basically two reasons for

405
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,319
that the first one is that

406
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,040
essentially the eu was an engine of

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,480
economic

408
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,759
liberalism taking away uh

409
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,920
obstacles to trade to uh exchanges etc

410
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,920
this was the agenda this was the

411
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,319
consensus basically and this was very

412
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,040
much in line with the dynamic of

413
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,000
uh globalization and even before the

414
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,959
covet crisis

415
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
somehow this the climate in europe uh

416
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,000
changed

417
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,759
uh the kind of much more negative

418
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,639
attitude to globalization

419
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,680
and the crisis has triggered sort of the

420
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,920
return of a strong national state

421
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,160
initially more or less the internal

422
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,959
market disappeared schengen disappeared

423
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,480
the nation state was back in full force

424
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,319
and and to some extent

425
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,839
this is still the case you've pointed to

426
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,079
schengen to the fact that

427
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
even now six months after the beginning

428
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,160
of the crisis the decisions

429
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,240
on opening borders and closing borders

430
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,360
and allowing tourists to come and go

431
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,240
are still national decisions and the

432
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,839
commission

433
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,399
is trying desperately to do some kind of

434
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,720
coordination

435
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,600
coordinating role but it's failing

436
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,959
ultimately it has not

437
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,480
taken back the initiative so i i

438
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,040
see that the political economic model of

439
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,320
europe

440
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,040
changing and it will be

441
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,839
ideally of course the eu becomes the

442
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,399
engines of

443
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
a new political economic model maybe

444
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,560
with

445
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:52,560
more social rights more

446
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,439
equality a stronger uh vexation system

447
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,479
etc

448
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,320
but i doubt very much whether there's

449
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,519
the consensus in the eu

450
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,000
to find a common way forward a departure

451
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,079
from

452
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,280
the long-established model of economic

453
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,480
liberalization

454
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,119
so that would lead to friction between

455
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,079
the

456
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,958
member states and between uh and the eu

457
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,720
institutions

458
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,039
and among the member states itself

459
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,520
because some were still keen on the

460
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,640
on the liberalization agenda others are

461
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,160
departing from it

462
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,480
so this is the first reason and the

463
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,360
second reason is i simply doubt

464
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,679
that the recovery fund wonderful as it

465
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,879
is

466
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,440
will be really effective

467
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,320
and to have an impact on backward

468
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,799
economics

469
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,320
if you look at the expectation for

470
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,120
growth in germany is

471
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,600
minus six percent the expectation for

472
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,799
growth

473
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,799
in italy is minus 11 to 12

474
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,720
and the recovery fund in terms of its

475
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,360
impact on the national economies in the

476
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,440
south

477
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,559
is maybe between two and three percent

478
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,080
to the maximum

479
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,600
so i think the divergence of between the

480
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,840
north and the south

481
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,280
uh will increase as a result of the

482
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,000
crisis and that of course

483
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,480
is a very bad thing in terms of the

484
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,280
sustainability of monetary union

485
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,039
so i think while the recovery fund is a

486
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,039
very positive development

487
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,200
uh there are reasons to be worried about

488
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,039
the future

489
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,679
thank you you've as as as often you put

490
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,000
your finger

491
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,400
on a couple of issues that interest me a

492
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,640
lot that i would like more people

493
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,520
to engage with one is you know the

494
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,120
the disease brings back the nation state

495
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,000
and it brings it back

496
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,719
in a europe that already was having

497
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,840
issues

498
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,840
of coherence where there was resentment

499
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,840
over

500
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,480
brussels rules and so on it's not just

501
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,918
poland

502
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,600
it's all it's all it's all the visigrad

503
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,039
countries too and um that's one issue

504
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,240
and the other issue which

505
00:18:53,039 --> 00:19:00,000
which i think is really important and is

506
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,600
is this question of whether the disease

507
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,799
will as you say exacerbate

508
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,600
the economic differences inside not just

509
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,000
the eurozone but inside europe too

510
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,039
because the recovery fund for all its

511
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,280
wonders

512
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:20,000
will come very late um and frankly

513
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,039
countries like italy and spain are

514
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,240
benefited much

515
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,000
more from the ecb right now which we

516
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,679
haven't really talked about i mean this

517
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,440
extraordinary

518
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,919
uh willingness of ecb to just

519
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,520
cover the spreads to make sure that

520
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,400
people can borrow money

521
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,080
now when they actually need it so i i'm

522
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,840
gonna open this to anyone

523
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,720
who um who wants to talk about

524
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,760
these two issues or one at a time one

525
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,799
about

526
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,679
the rise of the nation you know

527
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,799
in the face of everything and the other

528
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,720
whether in fact

529
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:01,760
um there'll be more economic disparity

530
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,360
following this um where the rich get

531
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,960
richer and the poor

532
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,879
get poorer uh maybe that's a too dark

533
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:14,240
of you who'd like to respond to that

534
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,600
raise your hand yeah yeah

535
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,280
go ahead and then heather yes i mean

536
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,639
on on the economic diversions i mean

537
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,639
of course it's going to take place

538
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,520
because i mean after all the

539
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,799
um the recovery fund and including with

540
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,960
the mfs i mean

541
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,240
it's such a small it's just a fraction

542
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,799
of the eu's overall

543
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,159
um gdp i mean less than two percent and

544
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,840
it was always clear that there would

545
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,960
have to be sort of national

546
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,399
um responses and national capacity

547
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,080
uh that would have to you know bear the

548
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,559
runs of the fiscal response

549
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,000
anyway it's just you know the money is

550
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,799
is too small and would always be too

551
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,360
small

552
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,280
um but for and but it's different than

553
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,000
uh for some countries for example for my

554
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,158
country

555
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,559
uh you know the the kind of money that

556
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,360
we're getting in grants and loans it's

557
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,960
basically and even just if you take the

558
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,600
resilience and recovery facility it's

559
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
just

560
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,199
it's another budget it's tantamount to

561
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,200
another uh annual budget

562
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
so it's it's it's especially for small

563
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,520
countries it's it's a lot of money

564
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,559
uh um but of course this is this is

565
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,200
never gonna be

566
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,200
uh enough to uh to to eliminate the

567
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,799
divergent that we'll see simply because

568
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,320
some member states have greater fiscal

569
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,840
capacity i mean

570
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,240
germany of course and the netherlands

571
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,439
and some uh and some don't because of

572
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,520
past deaths because of

573
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,120
because of old structural problems but

574
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,760
but there are also other instruments

575
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,760
which we

576
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,799
you know should point out apart from the

577
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,919
the budget and the

578
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,679
um and the next generation eu which uh

579
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,960
countries can can tap into i mean

580
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,480
there's obviously the

581
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,640
european stability mechanism which is

582
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,720
difficult for for political reasons

583
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,320
uh but there's also of course the you

584
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
know the ecb so

585
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,439
so i think there would have been

586
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,240
divergence anyway but the conditions in

587
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,080
the eu

588
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,080
the budget the next generation eu the

589
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,199
other instrument and the ecb policies

590
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,639
make it

591
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,159
i i think the best possible moment for

592
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,320
for for even countries which are in a

593
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,240
more difficult situation to borrow money

594
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,840
but uh but of course i mean the fact is

595
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,880
that the you know the rescue package

596
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,480
we're not going to be

597
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
uh we're not going to be enough the

598
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,440
other thing and this is uh

599
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,039
about the issue of rising nations that

600
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,120
you're absolutely right

601
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,480
um i think that when in a crisis

602
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,039
situation even

603
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,480
um you know all citizens uh looked the

604
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,080
government to solve it

605
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,679
and and the government by shutting

606
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,520
borders by by

607
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,960
instituting the various uh the various

608
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,080
restrictions obviously you know took

609
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,200
center stage

610
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,678
um but i i think you could still see

611
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,039
that

612
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,799
uh it was interesting that in some

613
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,080
respects the the eu

614
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,158
and the commission in particular was

615
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,960
able to assert itself even in march

616
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,080
and and april and particularly where it

617
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,240
was its competence

618
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,480
for instance in the internal market uh

619
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,559
there was this big issue of germany

620
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,080
basically refusing to at some point

621
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,158
refusing to export

622
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,600
uh health equipment that was needed to

623
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
other eu member states

624
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,600
uh but the commission stepped in uh

625
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,240
because it's the internal market

626
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,240
and it was able to to bring germany to

627
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,480
um you know to freely circulate

628
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,840
uh those those that critical uh

629
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,200
equipment so you can also see that the

630
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,199
commission where it is has

631
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,559
where it has competence can can assert

632
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,400
itself so um

633
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,639
yeah i mean going forward in you would

634
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,080
see the even in the recovery fund

635
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,000
the fact that it's attached to the

636
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,520
budget the fact that the commission is

637
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,080
in charge of it still

638
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,960
uh i think uh you know it's very

639
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,439
different than

640
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,120
uh in the financial economic crisis uh a

641
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,120
couple years back when it was a

642
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,360
uh intergovernmental deal by the memphis

643
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,280
state uh and the eu institutions were

644
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,559
completely shut out

645
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,559
great great heather

646
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
yeah to complement that i think there's

647
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,520
something of a paradox here

648
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,039
so this pandemic has revealed to all

649
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,360
citizens globally

650
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,240
the downsides of interdependence the

651
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,120
downsides

652
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,000
of people traveling so much of economies

653
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,080
being interdependent

654
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,320
there being so much trade and movement

655
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,480
because that's why the pandemic the

656
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,320
disease was able to spread so rapidly

657
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,600
and why it was it was very hard to

658
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,439
contain um

659
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,639
either the health effects or indeed the

660
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,799
economic effects

661
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,880
in one country or another but the and

662
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,240
the paradox lies in the fact that that

663
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,559
that has caused

664
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,840
people to look to their government as as

665
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,399
michael just said

666
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,918
um and so that there's a kind of retreat

667
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
to the nation state

668
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,919
but at the same time governments have to

669
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,880
coordinate and cooperate among

670
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,440
themselves

671
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,440
a lot more because otherwise they can't

672
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,320
get the information they can't um

673
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,000
keep the um the measures in place i mean

674
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,559
there's a huge amount of information

675
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,640
flow

676
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,399
between governments uh in order to do

677
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,120
track and trace and in order to

678
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,679
um to you know find out how people are

679
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,320
moving

680
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,520
and and to uh coordinate measures as

681
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,200
well and i think there'll be more of

682
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,600
that as the economic impact

683
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,360
hits but the paradox lies in the fact

684
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,678
that there's more big government

685
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,760
there's a much bigger role for the state

686
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,640
in a crisis a health crisis like this

687
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,360
but not necessarily big governance we're

688
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,000
not moving

689
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,279
at all towards a one-world government as

690
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,080
some of the conspiracies

691
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,679
say quite the opposite um because look

692
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,918
at how difficult it's been for the world

693
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,400
health organization and for the un

694
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,240
to play a bigger coordinating role uh

695
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,159
partly because of lack of u.s support

696
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,600
under this administration but also

697
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,520
because um there

698
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,639
there there's a there's a fragmentation

699
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,520
among their membership

700
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,880
too whereas the eu as something of a as

701
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,639
a meso level

702
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,120
uh of governance a regional organization

703
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,919
which has a strong community of law

704
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,000
um is able to do a lot more in terms of

705
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,600
coordinating responses because because

706
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,799
of the community of law which means that

707
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,959
agreements stick

708
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,080
and because it's a greater commitment to

709
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,760
working together

710
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,600
among the member governments so if you

711
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,440
think about it in that macro picture

712
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,039
rather than with our expectations that

713
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,840
the eu can do everything

714
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,360
um the eu's still got actually a really

715
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,760
important role to play

716
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,600
but i think the key question about the

717
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,840
sustainability of an eu

718
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,678
response on this and this this issue

719
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,720
about the economic disparities

720
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,880
lies in how the different countries uh

721
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,840
change towards a different kind of

722
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,679
economic model

723
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,879
chef and nano was rightly pointing out

724
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,840
the way that uh

725
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,240
this crisis is is rapidly speeding up

726
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,000
the turn away from economic liberalism

727
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,279
bringing the state back in bringing big

728
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,279
government back in

729
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,520
but governments in the eu have very

730
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,000
difficult different capabilities to do

731
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,679
that

732
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,120
so in the immediate term we've seen this

733
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,880
in terms of state aids

734
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,199
where i think member states have now

735
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,480
spent something like 3 trillion euros on

736
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,559
straight state aids an

737
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,679
absolutely extraordinary amount and half

738
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,480
of those have been spent

739
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,640
in germany so german companies are much

740
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,960
more supported by their government

741
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,760
than those in italy for example or in

742
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,480
spain

743
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,720
um even in comparison in france uh and

744
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,799
definitely in the smaller member states

745
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,720
um so there's already a big disparity in

746
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,960
how much uh

747
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,559
big companies in particular can look to

748
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,440
the state to prop them up into this kind

749
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,678
of crisis

750
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,480
and there's also huge differences in how

751
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,480
far

752
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,520
governments are able to do

753
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,080
redistribution

754
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,520
and social security so social support of

755
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,840
different kinds to

756
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,000
uh in terms of furlough schemes and

757
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,158
unemployment assistance and so on

758
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,760
um and yeah there's been some money put

759
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,840
to that through the recovery fund

760
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,760
but the capacity of across the eu to

761
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,120
support their populations and help them

762
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,919
in a crisis like this

763
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,439
varies enormously it's so much bigger in

764
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,159
the north of europe than it is in the

765
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,000
south

766
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,600
so it's not just economic disparities in

767
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,679
terms of gdp growth

768
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,600
it's also how much the population and

769
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,919
small businesses and and also

770
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,360
the middlestand are feel they can be

771
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,080
supported by their government

772
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,520
and that's where um some countries can

773
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
move away from economic liberalism

774
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,200
towards state support

775
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,120
much more rapidly than others and the

776
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,679
recovery fund won't affect that very

777
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,199
much

778
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,240
so i think we'll see the nordics in

779
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,240
germany being able to do it

780
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,440
great great i just want to give king a

781
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,840
chance to respond to

782
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,880
yeah i agree with heather and mihaw and

783
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,158
also what i

784
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,440
what i would just add is also a speed of

785
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,919
um of the decision that were made

786
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,880
to compare with the last crisis the the

787
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,399
decision or

788
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,000
forging a consensus to on the recovery

789
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,799
package actually was it was very fast so

790
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,240
of course money will come later but

791
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,320
today we are much

792
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,760
much further away than when we were in

793
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,439
2009 or 10.

794
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,440
what was also interesting about the

795
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,360
member states of course i think

796
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,799
i think it's a very human to turn to

797
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,240
your country when you face um pandemic

798
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,639
and you don't know what to do

799
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,559
whatever to use a mask or not

800
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,919
wwho says you shouldn't wear masks but

801
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,080
yet in slovakia

802
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,200
everyone has started to use masks at the

803
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,240
very beginning

804
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,399
so i think it's it's really it's it's

805
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,960
just what we do we were scared and we

806
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,840
turned to

807
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,840
to to member states but without

808
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,320
coordination on the eu level

809
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,039
i think everyone knows that this cannot

810
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,158
be uh

811
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,720
coordinated and it can be not solved or

812
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,080
fought on the on the eu level so i want

813
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,799
to say that eu has

814
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,199
learned from the past experience and uh

815
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,360
and

816
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,240
draw lessons learned and applied in this

817
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,039
crisis

818
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,600
uh i really like the quote of jean monet

819
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,679
it's from

820
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,639
1979 and he said that actually the

821
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,120
eu it's it's forging crisis and it will

822
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,919
be some of the responses uh solution and

823
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,039
solutions

824
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,520
applied for crisis so how that you will

825
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,360
come up

826
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,799
of it will will uh will um

827
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,719
will be the fate of the whole

828
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,559
organization but

829
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
before the crisis actually before the

830
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,600
pandemic we started it

831
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,960
in february we conducted a

832
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,520
opinion poll it was a qualitative one

833
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,399
on um on the willingness of delegate

834
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,639
more power

835
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,000
we had a conversation with heather about

836
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,799
it on

837
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,200
on this multi-speed concept of uh of

838
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,158
europe or flexible cooperation

839
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,039
and what is uh interesting it's it's

840
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,760
it's uh

841
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,360
obvious that there are not member states

842
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,120
are not willing at this stage to

843
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,399
delegate more power

844
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
but um there are certain groups that

845
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,239
emerged

846
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,559
and um from that and the headers started

847
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,679
to

848
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:29,200
uh classify them and i would add two

849
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,279
two additional groups so uh first we'll

850
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,480
there we have the governments in the eu

851
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,120
that are all

852
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,559
in they sign up let's see on the

853
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,080
franco-german motor

854
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,158
but also portugal belgium and

855
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,320
also estonia they are willing to

856
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,399
cooperate in a bigger but also in the

857
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,039
smaller formats of cooperation

858
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,678
there are also those that like don't

859
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,120
want

860
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,480
there are those that have out um

861
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,120
opt outs like denmark sweden island

862
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,840
but also poland or hungary that they

863
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,518
don't want

864
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,039
to go to the eurozone even though they

865
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,159
are not opposed to the

866
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,960
european integration itself we also have

867
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,360
those that

868
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,240
cannot get in which are bulgaria and

869
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,639
romania

870
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,519
but also we want those especially small

871
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,760
countries

872
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,720
that want to sit on the main table in

873
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,279
the eu

874
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,720
but kind of are not invited to the vip

875
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,159
parties

876
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,559
and so those this is the model that

877
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,240
eu is in i don't think this pandemic

878
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,918
will change this model

879
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:35,039
it will model through as as as many uh

880
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,000
say but uh let's hope though this also

881
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,640
those

882
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,600
smaller circles that that have been

883
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,480
created are

884
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,959
will not uh disrupt or dismantle uh the

885
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,640
eu

886
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,720
in in short or long term okay

887
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,640
very very good i have one more issue i

888
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,320
mean there are lots of issues i mean one

889
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,679
of the problems with the

890
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,519
budget is it cuts military spending

891
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,080
to almost ludicrous levels so that says

892
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,240
something

893
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,678
about ambitions for strategic autonomy

894
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,039
but there's also a big promise that

895
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:14,399
the money the new money would be used

896
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:17,840
for green development right

897
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,039
that everyone talks about oh everyone in

898
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,879
brussels says

899
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,240
this is a crisis we have to take

900
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,679
advantage of it

901
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,559
so let's put all this investment into

902
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,720
new industries and not restore old

903
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,840
industries while at the same time as you

904
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,120
know

905
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,320
the air the airlines are looking for aid

906
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,320
and people are worried about

907
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,720
unemployment and people are worried

908
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,158
about

909
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,799
huge piles of debt that are being

910
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,679
built up so what i did want to just

911
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,039
raise if

912
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,799
people can be kind of brief but

913
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:56,399
do you think um this ambition this

914
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,039
brussels ambition to create this extra

915
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,080
green

916
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,679
development with new money is this

917
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,678
likely to happen

918
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,279
or do you think it's going to get bogged

919
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,960
down as usual

920
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:12,880
in national decisions about

921
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,279
national priorities um

922
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,320
stefan do you do you want to respond to

923
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,840
that if not

924
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,519
fine please yeah no i think

925
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,039
obviously there's this commitment that

926
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,360
30 percent of the

927
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,679
money should be spent on on climate

928
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,360
change and on environmental protection

929
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,880
but i think you've pointed to the real

930
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,080
dilemma basically

931
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,399
we we have a huge crisis which in a way

932
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,158
is

933
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,760
good for climate change because you

934
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,320
realize how things

935
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,080
can change during the crisis nobody has

936
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,799
no european citizen had

937
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,158
expected that the world the life of

938
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,158
every citizen can

939
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,279
change so fundamentally within a few

940
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,720
weeks basically

941
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,519
so this in a way makes probably people

942
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,640
capable of envisaging rather

943
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,600
far-reaching change

944
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,600
also driven by climate change so as such

945
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,240
i think it's a positive impetus

946
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,719
but as you said that the problem is the

947
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,320
dilemma between

948
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,839
the existing jobs and potential new jobs

949
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,440
is it likely that a whole lot of this

950
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,639
money will be

951
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,800
invested in legacy in industries that

952
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,919
are basically obsolete that maybe

953
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,720
to protect existing very much entrenched

954
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,399
interests

955
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,719
or whether it will really go into

956
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,118
innovation and on that i think

957
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,078
this ultimately will be a national

958
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,200
decision it

959
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,599
will depend very much on each uh

960
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,719
on the political systems in each country

961
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,119
to determine the

962
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,158
the kind of share of resources that are

963
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,520
devoted to but

964
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:49,679
the acute economic crisis with

965
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,879
lots of job losses uh is not ideal

966
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,960
uh for a very innovative

967
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,960
creative kind of restructuring of the

968
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
economy but the positive

969
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,800
thing i want to say once again is the

970
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,200
fact that everybody realizes

971
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,119
how life can change quite fundamentally

972
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,560
i think that preparedness

973
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,960
of envisaging uh

974
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,040
rather significant changes of lifestyle

975
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,200
is probably higher now than it was a few

976
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,480
months ago

977
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,480
great um does anyone else want to

978
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,920
respond to that

979
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,920
you'll have to wait yeah just call it i

980
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,120
can see you just briefly on that okay

981
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,960
heather and michael

982
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,799
[Music]

983
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,160
yeah the scale and scope of potential

984
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,000
changes there and also

985
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,359
the willingness of citizens to follow

986
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,839
government lead

987
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,880
um was much bigger it's much harder for

988
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,960
politicians to say

989
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,119
oh the public will never accept this no

990
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,680
way can such radical changes be made

991
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,520
clearly they can be made and also the

992
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,759
fiscal room is much greater

993
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,640
um now there's very little talk about

994
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,400
austerity

995
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,839
and about oh we can't borrow too much on

996
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,640
the markets and we've got to keep debt

997
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,000
levels down

998
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,400
that that's just been blown out of the

999
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,640
window but the tricky thing is

1000
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,880
um moving to what will be a very

1001
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,200
labor-intensive

1002
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,640
climate transition faster because as

1003
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,480
jeff and says the key thing is

1004
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,560
employment if you can show

1005
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,119
that climate transition will involve a

1006
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,119
lot of a lot of employment which it will

1007
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,119
think about all of the uh putting

1008
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,839
insulation into homes and refitting

1009
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,520
buildings

1010
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,759
and building new infrastructure for

1011
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,200
electric cars all of this involves a

1012
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,400
huge amount of labor

1013
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,520
that's the thing that needs to be

1014
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,240
emphasized now at eu level

1015
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,359
great um carl we've got about five

1016
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,479
minutes left so

1017
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,520
and believe it or not time is passing so

1018
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,839
off you go but let's let's try to keep

1019
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,280
it

1020
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:44,160
brief go ahead yeah

1021
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,880
on the um green deal and and the climate

1022
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,560
ambitions

1023
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,200
uh i i i would agree with uh with stefan

1024
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,400
and uh in in saying that it's definitely

1025
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,279
going to be up to the member states and

1026
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,280
there's one faith

1027
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,119
you know one big problem with the way

1028
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,280
that the deal was struck in july between

1029
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,760
e leaders and what you could see is that

1030
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,320
for you know in order to maintain the

1031
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,480
uh you know the the level of spending in

1032
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,200
the next generation eu they basically

1033
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,760
slashed uh money from the from the

1034
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,759
budget

1035
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,200
and from uh other programs which would

1036
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,480
be pan-european and which would be

1037
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,040
devoted precisely

1038
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,480
to uh to the green transition uh which

1039
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,320
there's and there's a sort of a national

1040
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,240
logic to it that member states want

1041
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,920
a larger pot of money which is more

1042
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
flexible which they can use whichever

1043
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,480
they

1044
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,319
see whichever way they see fit so for

1045
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,839
instance rather than eu programs

1046
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,359
such as the just transition fund which

1047
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,200
would be distributed by the commission

1048
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,400
that obviously was slashed so that

1049
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,160
governments can spend

1050
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,680
uh the next generation eu money as they

1051
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,480
see fit and there's i think the problem

1052
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,000
some member states

1053
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,760
some governments which are very

1054
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,040
committed to the climate target will

1055
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,079
obviously spend them on their own

1056
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,599
transition whereas

1057
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,599
i fear that for instance my government

1058
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,960
will want as much flexibility

1059
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,640
in the money and in the ground so they

1060
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,839
can spend uh i don't know building

1061
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,359
highways

1062
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,880
this is this is i think the risk now is

1063
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,680
that it's much more in the hands of

1064
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,079
member states

1065
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,279
rather than inside of an overall uh sort

1066
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,079
of commission like that's

1067
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,119
a green deal right that's what europe

1068
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,200
needs is more

1069
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,440
highways i do have one question which

1070
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,879
um i would like to raise from the

1071
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,320
audience from anja

1072
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,520
matasek who who who asks

1073
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,560
who basically says it's hardly about

1074
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,880
a homogenous political space

1075
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,160
and that also applies to the visigrad

1076
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,960
four

1077
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,078
so how much is the east west division

1078
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,200
real

1079
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,760
for all of you um and

1080
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,200
are these division lines really having

1081
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,640
an effect

1082
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,359
on how the eu is functioning now

1083
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,560
i mean let's start with kinga and then

1084
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,119
maybe

1085
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,680
one other person who wants to answer and

1086
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,800
then i think we're probably out of time

1087
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,680
go ahead yeah thank you

1088
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,160
i think it's if we can call it either

1089
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,000
east west division north south or rather

1090
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,040
fragmentation of the eu

1091
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,920
i don't think that um in this crisis uh

1092
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,520
we reached

1093
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,400
the member states reached any agreement

1094
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,040
but so the east-west divide will still

1095
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,800
exist

1096
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,640
uh i would say uh but um

1097
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,359
it's um i saw very uh evolution of the

1098
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,920
visegrad

1099
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,839
uh four uh sitting being a polish

1100
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,920
citizen sitting in slovakia

1101
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,279
is really uh interesting to observe

1102
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,599
because from warsaw

1103
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,960
we always thought that we are the big

1104
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,520
leader of the v4

1105
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,480
and our voice matters and we are the

1106
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,599
ones that should

1107
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,680
represent the v4 in uh in brussels

1108
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,520
which is not the case when you look at

1109
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,319
the v4 from slovakia

1110
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,720
slovakia has much more different and

1111
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,920
more

1112
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,319
deeper links with czech republic or

1113
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,160
hungary and what was interesting

1114
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,800
especially during the pandemic

1115
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,040
is that slovakia i don't know what mihao

1116
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,200
thinks about it but to me

1117
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,640
slovakia has started to cooperate it

1118
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,879
closely and there were more

1119
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,319
more meetings with austria and czech

1120
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,440
republic they called it

1121
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,160
slavko format so it seems like

1122
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,359
slovakia will never abandon before but

1123
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,399
is also

1124
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,400
looking to other it's other options

1125
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,079
and i guess it's trying to alienate a

1126
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,280
little bit itself from

1127
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,680
the the the bad view or the bad image

1128
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,880
that

1129
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,759
v4 has obtained in in brussels and is

1130
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,200
trying to be a constructive player

1131
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,200
in the european union

1132
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,680
how do you see it no it

1133
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,000
was just putting your own spot no no no

1134
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,640
i mean

1135
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,440
i i i think my country should definitely

1136
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,759
uh be

1137
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,200
uh looking at other options obviously uh

1138
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,920
vishagrad is useful

1139
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,919
to the extent that it is but uh on the

1140
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,599
eu stage i think slovakia absolutely

1141
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,079
needs to look at different

1142
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,119
other partners ones that you know share

1143
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,960
its uh

1144
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,200
its value so to speak and it's in its

1145
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,440
outlook on on the future of the eu which

1146
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,759
uh frankly at the moment hungary or

1147
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,160
poland do not and i think

1148
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,960
association with with the bishop group

1149
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,480
and with these two

1150
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,720
countries in particular it's toxic and

1151
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,599
it's a problem for slovak eu policy i

1152
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,160
mean that that i

1153
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,599
i think is quite clear to everyone um

1154
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,078
and and i think this government

1155
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,680
and i hope that it's going to be uh is

1156
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,240
going going to be doing that

1157
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,359
but to just one final sentence on the on

1158
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,680
on the broader point the

1159
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,359
question that you asked i think there is

1160
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,078
uh an increasingly

1161
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,200
not an east-west divergence but there's

1162
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,319
a fragmentation

1163
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,480
along in the eu along you know values

1164
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,359
of democracy rule of law and fundamental

1165
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,400
rights and

1166
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,440
and that's been going on throughout the

1167
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,520
pandemic and that

1168
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,200
will be going on i think now by now it's

1169
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,920
not just hungary and poland

1170
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,279
there might be you know there not too

1171
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,079
encouraging signs from other member

1172
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,920
states as well

1173
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,359
but i think at some point this is going

1174
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,520
to be the big issue that

1175
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,359
the um that the eu will stumble upon and

1176
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,319
that this creates fragmentation in the

1177
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,040
legal space

1178
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,200
of the eu and also to policy so law

1179
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,640
enforcement uh cooperation because how

1180
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,078
can you trust the government

1181
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,000
whose you know prosecutors are

1182
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,000
politically uh politically

1183
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,520
uh pliable and not independent and all

1184
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,520
it throws up all sorts of issues

1185
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,720
i think this is going to be the big uh

1186
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,160
the big uh you know

1187
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,799
wedge and possibly cleavage in the eu

1188
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,560
right well you've touched on something

1189
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,520
that worries me very much

1190
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,839
um because sometimes i think that you

1191
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,880
know

1192
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,078
it's the value question and the rule of

1193
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,359
law question

1194
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,640
that if anything will undermine this

1195
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,598
wonderful idea of um

1196
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,560
shared sovereignty i wish we had more

1197
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,520
time

1198
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,200
um you've all been great i i want to

1199
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,240
thank each of you

1200
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,279
and as we stare down into the earth

1201
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,879
down below us you should know

1202
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,680
that the next panel will take us to mars

1203
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,200
but it will be about the future of mars

1204
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,399
exploration

1205
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,640
a mission of perseverance and ingenuity

1206
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,240
so we look forward to that we thank you

1207
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:12,000

1208
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:14,399

1209
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,400

globesec bratislava forum is the

1212
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,599
platform to tackle disruption

1213
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,079
and discuss solutions for better

tomorrows

1215
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,200
basic theme of disruption is crucial

1216
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,799
because to me

1217
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,480
the issue is not whether it's climate

1218
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,880
change or whether it's the chinese or

1219
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,880
the russian
