1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
space prior to the elections we analyze

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,080
state vulnerabilities

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
to hybrid threats and work with civil

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
servants to cover these gaps

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
or within our latest initiative the

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,719
alliance for healthy infosphere

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,119
we examine how to make social media more

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,600
just and transparent for everyone

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,840
but then we also focus on how all these

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,240
attempts to undermine our democracies

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,480
actually impact the societies by

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,439
conducting a series of opinion polls and

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,359
focus groups

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,599
we are able to monitor trends in public

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,800
attitudes towards key issues that shape

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
the societies

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,879
including the support for eu and nato

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,840
membership the perception of media

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,680
or satisfaction with democracy based on

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,360
all this research which was quoted for

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,440
example by the u.s senate

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,039
french government but also in major

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,879
international media such as foreign

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
policy or the new york times

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,718
we provide recommendations to a range of

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
stakeholders on both sides of the

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,840
atlantic

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,160
but we also try to make a difference on

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,760
the ground by partnering with other

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,358
think tanks universities public

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,120
institutions or media

32
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,040
we created two online courses on this

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,479
information we develop manuals on

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
strategic communication

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,240
we provide trainings for public

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
officials or ngos we even engage

37
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,439
youtubers in a campaign focusing on

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
young people

39
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,000
with all these activities we generate

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,080
new ideas provide creative solutions

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,439
and engage relevant stakeholders to

42
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,600
drive positive change

43
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,600
towards more resilient democracies in

44
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,759

dedicated to a trend called rising

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,239
divisions will change the face of

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
democracy

61
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,640
during which we will discuss the future

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,079
of democracy

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,000

international republican institute

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,159
this session will be slightly different

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,040
as we will begin with some

77
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,760
contextual data first uh showing what

78
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,079
the people

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
the very basic component of every system

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440
to function

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,120
actually think about democracy and the

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,079
way the governance system functions

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,360
today

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,920
so let me begin with uh presenting uh

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,920
you with our research which is called

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,559
voices of central and eastern europe

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,640
you can find it on our website um in

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,519
this report we analyzed attitudes of

89
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,640
more than 10

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,440
000 uh people from central and eastern

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,559
europe

92
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,599
and within the report we found out among

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,640
others that

94
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,119
people are generally not satisfied with

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,518
how their governance system functions

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,879
um they feel disconnected from their

97
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
governing elites

98
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,640
as around 60 percent of them think that

99
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,798
their needs are not

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,640
taken into account by the system in

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,200
their country 70

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,319
believe that those with the contact to

103
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,439
political elites

104
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,720
are favored in the society and while

105
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,040
on average 87 percent of of respondents

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,920
said that they were satisfied with life

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,918
42 percent are satisfied with how

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,959
democracy works in their country

109
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,680
only um the satisfaction is

110
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,199
strong only in austria uh but it is

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
below 50

112
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
in all the countries in central and

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,840
eastern europe

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
um before i pass the words to laura i

115
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,719
would like to encourage

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,440
all the attendees watching us to ask

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
questions

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,560
via platform as there will be a q a

119
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,559
session

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,199
during the last 10 minutes of of the

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,680
debate and now i would like to pass

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,360
the word to laura who will provide us

123
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
with more global insight and i would

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,240
like to ask

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,840
for the presentation as well

126
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,360
great thank you so much it's a real

127
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,119
pleasure to be here and to share the

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,919
data from pew research center

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,759
um as dominica mentioned we are hoping

130
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,159
to provide a more global kind of picture

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
of this

132
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,520
unfortunately with only seven minutes i

133
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,320
can't get into the intricacies of each

134
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,479
particular

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,840
country but i look forward to a question

136
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,880
and answer session where maybe i can

137
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,638
share a bit more

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,560
next slide before i start i just want to

139
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,800
give you a sense of what these data are

140
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
this survey was conducted across 34

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,560
countries from may

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
to october of 2019 so before the covet

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,600
19

144
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
pandemic and every survey is nationally

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,240
representative

146
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,080
next slide here you can see the

147
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,240
countries represented in the survey

148
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,520
so we cover europe relatively heavily in

149
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,960
this survey with both

150
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,639
western europe and central and eastern

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,479
european countries represented

152
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,080
but we also have key countries in many

153
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,680
other regions of the world

154
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,359
next slide what i'm going to speak to

155
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,880
you about first is people's attachment

156
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,840
to different democratic rights and

157
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,320
institutions

158
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,320
next slide

159
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,000
first you can see here that we asked

160
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,599
about a number of different principles

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,199
all of which might be considered to be

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,639
important to a democracy

163
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,400
we asked people whether or not they were

164
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,639
very important somewhat important not

165
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,638
too important or not important at all

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
and you can see here medians based on

167
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,960
the 34 countries that we surveyed

168
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,319
so while there was variation across the

169
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
countries and i'll show you that in one

170
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,479
moment

171
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,318
generally speaking we saw that a few

172
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,120
principles were considered very

173
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
important

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,639
first was a fair judiciary in almost

175
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,479
every country that we surveyed

176
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,160
fair judiciary was either the first or

177
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,039
the second most important democratic

178
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,280
tenant

179
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
second to that often was gender equality

180
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,239
people tended to say that gender

181
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,440
equality was very important to have in

182
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
their country

183
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,319
where there was a little bit more

184
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,199
variation though was on issues of free

185
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,960
religion

186
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,960
in the countries where people tended to

187
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,560
identify as very religious

188
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,400
they were more likely to see this as an

189
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
important tenet in other parts of the

190
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,560
world including in western europe free

191
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
religion was seen as much less important

192
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
and then when it comes to other tenets

193
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
like free speech press freedom freedom

194
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,318
of the internet

195
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,239
we saw generally that people were

196
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,319
relatively varied across countries as to

197
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,000
whether or not this was important at all

198
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,759
generally speaking people in western

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
europe were more likely to say each of

200
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,520
these was very important than people in

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,560
most other regions including central and

202
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,080
eastern europe

203
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,599
and when it came to issues like human

204
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,440
rights groups operating freely or

205
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,280
opposition parties operating freely

206
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,479
we sometimes saw a few people in some of

207
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,758
these countries saying that they were

208
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,960
important at all

209
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,720
next slide here

210
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,318
you can see the variation that i talked

211
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,479
about so just to give you some

212
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,840
um like an illustrative map to get at

213
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,520
this idea here you can see the

214
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
percentage of people by country who say

215
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
it's very

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,039
important to have a free media in our

217
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,000
country without government or state

218
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,759
censorship

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,440
you can see for example that only 28

220
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,240
percent of lebanese say that this is

221
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,560
very important

222
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,360
but 89 percent of greeks say that it's

223
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
very important

224
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,520
so it really runs the gamut when we look

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,520
at which countries consider it to be

226
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,318
very important it doesn't necessarily

227
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
correlate

228
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,400
with places that have press freedoms

229
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,120
either in fact some of the countries

230
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,239
where we

231
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,080
might see relatively high rankings among

232
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,919
some of the external indices for press

233
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,960
freedoms are ones that don't necessarily

234
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
value it as much

235
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,239
you might look for example to the

236
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,679
netherlands or germany where only around

237
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,639
two-thirds tend to say it's very

238
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,639
important

239
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,919
next slide but one thing that's perhaps

240
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,599
encouraging for people who are

241
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,039
interested in democratic freedoms

242
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,280
is that for a handful of freedoms

243
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,919
particularly media freedom and internet

244
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,758
freedom

245
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,520
more people today say that it's very

246
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,120
important in their country to have these

247
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,799
things than said the same when we asked

248
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,759
the question in 2015.

249
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,440
you can see for example um in places

250
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,840
like the uk and turkey

251
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,159
differences are of 19 percentage points

252
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,838
between 2015 and 2019.

253
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,120
next slide so we've seen generally that

254
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
people have some commitment to

255
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,959
democratic institutions and democratic

256
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,560
freedoms but not necessarily to all of

257
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,119
them equally and it varies across the

258
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,880
world

259
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,240
but how then do they think democracy is

260
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,080
working in their country

261
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,519
next slide here again you can see the

262
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,760
median percentages

263
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,760
on balance people are dissatisfied with

264
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,439
democracy rather than satisfied

265
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
more people tend to say that they are

266
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,480
not satisfied with how democracy is

267
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,160
performing in their country than to say

268
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,880
that they are satisfied

269
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,880
and some of this is related to the next

270
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,240
column that you see which is in general

271
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,000
people tend to think that elected

272
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
officials don't care what people like

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,839
them

274
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,600
think it's also related to that

275
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,519
people clearly believe that the state is

276
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,360
run for the benefit of all people

277
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,279
as i'll show you in one moment too this

278
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
is a sense that's changed over time and

279
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,360
not for the better

280
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
so despite all of this dissatisfaction

281
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,480
people are much to voting

282
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,240
around two-thirds the median of

283
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,760
two-thirds say that voting gives people

284
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
like them a say in how the government

285
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,279
runs things and people are relatively

286
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,080
committed to the idea of voting and to

287
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,600
elections

288
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,360
even if they tend to be dissatisfied

289
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,959
with the outcome at times

290
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
next slide and here's what i mentioned

291
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,119
about the

292
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,959
state being run for the benefit of all

293
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
people you can see that over the last

294
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,079
two or so decades

295
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,600
we've seen a stark decrease in the

296
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,120
percentage of people who agree that the

297
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
state has run for the benefit of all

298
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,760
people

299
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,839
and the decrease is sharpest in many

300
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,480
countries in western europe as well as

301
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,040
in the us

302
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,240
and some some parts of eastern europe as

303
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,599
well

304
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,720
next slide so one of the things that

305
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,320
we've wanted to understand

306
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,399
is why people are dissatisfied with

307
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,160
democracy one of the

308
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,839
main factors that seems to affect

309
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,040
people's satisfaction is whether or not

310
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,959
they think the current economic

311
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,680
situation in their country is good or is

312
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,518
bad

313
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,199
in hungary the gap is largest you're

314
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,000
looking at a dot plot essentially that's

315
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,000
just showing

316
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,279
the most severe differences but this was

317
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,279
actually a pattern that we found in

318
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,399
almost every country that we surveyed

319
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,160
generally people who say that the

320
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,880
current economic situation is bad in

321
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,480
their country

322
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,399
are much less likely to say that they're

323
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,760
dissatisfied with democracy than people

324
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,399
who say that the current economic

325
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,920
situation

326
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,920
is good next slide

327
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
moreover people who think that their

328
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,399
children will not have good

329
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,560
opportunities tend to be more

330
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,000
more dissatisfied with democracy here

331
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,680
again you can see that slovakia and

332
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,560
hungary stand out for the magnitude of

333
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,000
the difference here

334
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,680
people who are pessimistic about their

335
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
children's opportunities are more likely

336
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,640
to be dissatisfied than those who are

337
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,760
optimistic

338
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,279
next slide

339
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,040
and as i mentioned believing that

340
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,079
elected officials don't care what people

341
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
like you think

342
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,319
tends to be uh very closely related to

343
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,160
people's satisfaction with democracy

344
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,680
this disenchantment with elites and this

345
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
general sense that elites are out of

346
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,519
touch

347
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,279
is something that we've recorded in many

348
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,279
of our surveys next slide

349
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,880
so what then do people want and are

350
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,399
there opportunities for

351
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,320
other systems of government that people

352
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,480
might be open to next slide

353
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,079
here you see data from a 2017 survey

354
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,440
that we conducted the countries are

355
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,040
slightly different and the median here

356
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,279
is based on 38 countries

357
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,959
but the general patterns that we see are

358
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,040
relatively steady

359
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,719
first when we ask people whether or not

360
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,480
representative democracy would be a good

361
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,839
or a bad way to govern the country

362
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,279
generally speaking we see that this is

363
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,040
the most appealing form of government

364
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,920
for everyone that we surveyed

365
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,800
78 tend to say that this is a good

366
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,839
option

367
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,079
there's some support also for direct

368
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,920
democracy

369
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,079
it's a little bit more it comes with

370
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,599
rule by expert rule by a strong leader a

371
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,680
rule by the military

372
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,279
but notably around a quarter of people

373
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,519
in some of these countries and a median

374
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
of

375
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,600
a quarter across the 38 countries say

376
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,079
that rule by a strong leader or rule the

377
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,519
military

378
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,680
would be a good way to govern their

379
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,279
countries so we wanted to understand

380
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,959
who's more committed to representative

381
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,680
democracy and who's more committed to

382
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,839
rule by

383
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,839
strong leader or military next slide

384
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,199
when it comes to commitment to a

385
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,720
representative democracy one of the

386
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320
things that predicts people's support

387
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
for this is a general sense that

388
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,839
diversity makes

389
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,279
their country a better place to live so

390
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,959
you can see in some of these countries

391
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,519
for example in south africa and in

392
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,599
sweden

393
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
this tolerance for multiculturalism for

394
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,279
diversity tends to make people much more

395
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,920
likely to think that a representative

396
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,600
system

397
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,360
where people where representatives are

398
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,079
elected by citizens who decide what

399
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,399
becomes law

400
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,880
is a better way to govern the country

401
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,880
next slide

402
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,800
the same is also true about children's

403
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,160
optimism once again the general sense

404
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,079
that things are going in the correct

405
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,600
direction for the next generation that

406
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,920
opportunities will exist

407
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
is strongly related to support for a

408
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,719
representative

409
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,560
democratic system those who are more

410
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,000
pessimistic about this tend to be less

411
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,760
likely to support representative

412
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,320
democracy and much more open to

413
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,319
non-democratic alternatives next slide

414
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,479
and this this sense of nostalgia and

415
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
this sense of opportunity

416
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,240
are also related to children's

417
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
opportunity so we ask people not just

418
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,959
about children's opportunities but

419
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,359
whether or not they say that life

420
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,119
for people like them um is better or

421
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,800
worse compared to 50 years ago

422
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,399
and those who generally see that people

423
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,760
like them have improved

424
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,760
tend to be more likely to support

425
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,200
representative democracy whereas those

426
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,639
who are kind of more nostalgic for the

427
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,839
past or who think that they had more

428
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
opportunities

429
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,959
50 years prior are less likely to be

430
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,959
open to representative democracy

431
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,399
so these are not all of the factors that

432
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,760
are related to people's support for

433
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,440
representative democracy

434
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,360
but hopefully they give some sense for

435
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,680
what's leading people to be satisfied or

436
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,279
dissatisfied across the globe

437
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
one of the things that we tend to see is

438
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,959
that people are attached to democratic

439
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,639
principles but don't necessarily believe

440
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,399
that the principles are being delivered

441
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,800
upon and that their satisfaction has

442
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
been

443
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,000
i'm sorry their dissatisfaction has been

444
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,760
growing in recent years

445
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,120
next slide so i look forward to talking

446
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,720
with you more in the question and answer

447
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,519
thank you

448
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,959
thank you very much laura um very

449
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,160
interesting insight

450
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,638
to start with i believe that

451
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,680
there is a bit of a paradox that that we

452
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,160
could see there that

453
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,519
at one hand as you rightly said on one

454
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,959
hand we have

455
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,720
people valuing basic democratic

456
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,680
principles they

457
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,519
want to have a judiciary which is

458
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,079
independent they are committed to voting

459
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,279
but

460
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,479
at the same time they feel disillusioned

461
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,199
they feel disconnected um and as

462
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,880
some of the largest democracy indexes

463
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,719
say like freedom house or or vegan

464
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,360
liberal democracy index

465
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,000
the democratic standards as such in

466
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,079
western

467
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,680
europe as well as central and eastern

468
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,719
europe are declining

469
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,439
so my question to joanna if i may

470
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,560
would be um are did people

471
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,639
stop caring about democracy are the

472
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,359
standards declining because people stop

473
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,560
caring or do they have a reason to do so

474
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
and if they do

475
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:26,719
what is what is wrong now with with the

476
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:28,240
way democracies function

477
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,880
so i'm glad you started with a really

478
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,560
easy question that doesn't require

479
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,639
that you know that has a really simple

480
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,599
answer so so thank you first of all

481
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,000
actually thank you for

482
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,079
for having me on this panel and for for

483
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,440
the conference in general

484
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,880
um i think that that one of the

485
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,199
interesting things that

486
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,079
what lisa is showing is that while

487
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,800
people

488
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,560
do respect democracy as a whole they

489
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
don't necessarily recognize all of the

490
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,479
component parts of it

491
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
so the fact that they're not valuing

492
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,839
free media

493
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,920
and the need for independent

494
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,440
organizations and ngos and human rights

495
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,719
organizations kind of shows that there's

496
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,120
a disconnect which means that

497
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,079
the way that democracy seems to be being

498
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,079
defined

499
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:16,160
is limited to the state sector and

500
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,599
we're really limiting the conversation

501
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,639
to how the government

502
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,720
and elected officials are functioning

503
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,920
um and i there does seem to be a broad

504
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,759
perception

505
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,519
somehow this is numbering right that it

506
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,959
is being run by elites and whether you

507
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,480
want to talk about it globally or you

508
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,160
want to talk about a country elite

509
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,279
but that essentially somehow there's

510
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,680
politics has become a game as opposed to

511
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,600
a genuine engagement with the population

512
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,319
and therefore speaking for it

513
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,320
um you know and again i think a lot of

514
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,040
this ends up being perception

515
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,560
rather than fact i mean fundamentally

516
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,079
the way that

517
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,518
parliaments function have always

518
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,758
functioned but perhaps there's a degree

519
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,800
of complacency in terms of

520
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,519
the degree to how often or there's a

521
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,559
sense that there's an enough

522
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,000
inauthenticity on the part of elected

523
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,639
officials and how they engage in the

524
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,439
public

525
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
and that they take for granted that the

526
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,240
things

527
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,240
have functioned over the past 50 years

528
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,160
is how they're going to continue

529
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,679
um and if there's one thing that history

530
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
shows is that for one it's not

531
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,439
linear which means that there always has

532
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,400
to be some kind of evolution it's also

533
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,720
not

534
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,160
completely cyclical right i had a very

535
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,600
intelligent history professor who always

536
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,480
said that it was more like an ellipsis

537
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,080
which means that it

538
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,240
goes out and it comes back and different

539
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,360
forms but it means you have to always go

540
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,640
through a process

541
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,120
of tweaking and changing um i'll

542
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,559
end with one thing that perhaps it was

543
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,799
covered in a different panel but it just

544
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,280
came up in in the conversation yesterday

545
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:50,320
is that perhaps one of the one of the

546
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,678
positive aspects of the global covid

547
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,879
pandemic

548
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,720
has demonstrated that

549
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,039
the disconnect with the general

550
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
population and the lack of engagement

551
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,760
with non-state actors including media

552
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,799
including ngos

553
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,160
demonstrates that there's a very real

554
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,879
risk to the public not trusting its

555
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
government

556
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,320
right it means that it is less compliant

557
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,480
to

558
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,399
regulations that the government proposes

559
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,679
which in fact saves lives

560
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,679
and so because this introduced a very

561
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,840
real physical and health threat

562
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,840
perhaps are going to be a learning

563
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
opportunity

564
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,919
the governance gaps have a consequence

565
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,760
on all parts of society from the state

566
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,480
actors to the non-state to the general

567
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
citizen

568
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,840
but it remains to be seen how well that

569
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,840
lesson was learned

570
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,439
thank you very much um absolutely um

571
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,919
it uh i completely agree with the fact

572
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,280
that

573
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,960
uh we are facing um sort of a

574
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,960
uh a new opportunity to to perhaps also

575
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,960
uh maybe uh redefine the rules of the

576
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,720
game but at the same time we are

577
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:11,120
facing a huge uh crisis uh

578
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,559
uh in the in amid the the covered 1919

579
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,039
pandemic and

580
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,240
we cannot at the at the moment probably

581
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,720
um

582
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,320
uh uh predict any any economic social

583
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,360
political consequences so i would like

584
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,320
to ask chris

585
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,439
um since we are facing this

586
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,879
multi-dimensional crisis right now

587
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,039
um isn't this uh to the on the contrary

588
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,640
a perfect then fertile ground for

589
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,039
for populists and for for

590
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,200
anti-democratic liberal forces to

591
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,120
actually deepen and to exploit his

592
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,880
vulnerabilities and actually deepen the

593
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,520
divisions into society and

594
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,080
and polarization and and intensify these

595
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,080
campaigns

596
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,880
so thank you for the question dominica

597
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,640
and um i just want to acknowledge right

598
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,000
at the outset the the value and

599
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,480
importance of

600
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,799
the work that you do at globesec and the

601
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,120
work that pew research does i think

602
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,000
one of the things we see from from these

603
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,080
data

604
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
is that the challenges as you suggest to

605
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,678
democracy

606
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,960
that have emerged are emerging on

607
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,799
multiple fronts

608
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,480
and there's no single factor i think

609
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,559
that can be

610
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,520
set out as as a principal factor for

611
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,520
this sort of challenge

612
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,000
and i think in that context you know the

613
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,360
the um

614
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,400
among the largest uh challenges we've

615
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,678
faced has been

616
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,520
this enormous shift in the

617
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,919
way in which people um absorb

618
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,080
information receive information joanna

619
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,840
alluded to this in terms of how

620
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,039
people perceive the situation around

621
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,399
them and the governance around them and

622
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,679
i think it's important

623
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,600
just for a moment to to touch on um

624
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,520
how we've arrived at this place looking

625
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,080
at say the last

626
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,200
15 years or so and the extraordinary

627
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,600
pace of change that

628
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
that's occurred and so on the one hand

629
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,799
we've had the weakening of traditional

630
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,799
media and i would note that

631
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,400
in both the globe sec findings and in

632
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,840
the pew research findings

633
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,320
there's there's a good deal of

634
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,879
discussion about the emergence of

635
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,480
conspiracy theories on the one hand the

636
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,120
erosion of trust

637
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,200
in the media space and i think these are

638
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,559
really critical factors among the many

639
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
factors that have emerged that are

640
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,440
driving

641
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,158
uh some of the problems we're facing and

642
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,520
so certainly since the financial crisis

643
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,360
of

644
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,918
2008 there's been an acceleration of the

645
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,080
weakening

646
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,320
weakening of traditional media there's

647
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,678
been really explosive growth

648
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,799
of digital media especially social media

649
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,600
happening together and i think in this

650
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,918
context

651
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
we've probably under-appreciated the

652
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,200
degree to which today

653
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,799
people would be consuming news and

654
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,480
information in new ways

655
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,480
the way in which political campaigns

656
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,720
would be organized and driven

657
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,240
and really critically the way mass

658
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,480
opinion is formed

659
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,159
today it's dramatically different than

660
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,400
even a decade ago and i think all of

661
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,640
this has to be taken into account

662
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,640
when we think about the research data

663
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,600
we're evaluating the public opinion data

664
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,320
we're looking at

665
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,000
and how that's been influencing um

666
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,039
people around the world and so in a

667
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,039
sense the

668
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,440
the real issues that have emerged say in

669
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,280
the central and european context

670
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,360
where people in certain countries have

671
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,200
taken a much more critical look at their

672
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,439
own political elites

673
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,880
there's an element of frustration in the

674
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,240
way in which

675
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,159
democracy democracies seem to be

676
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,919
delivering at the same time

677
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,280
there are any number of settings in in

678
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,400
the wider region where

679
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,158
in the democratic context uh democracies

680
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,919
have a good deal of resilience and i

681
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,919
would say the baltic states

682
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,039
scandinavian states fall into these

683
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,280
categories broadly speaking

684
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,000
and then of course if we shift from a

685
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,559
discussion of open societies which have

686
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,720
um extensive challenges that that have

687
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,480
been discussed i think very well

688
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,840
earlier in the session if we look at

689
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,880
closed societies

690
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,559
i think in this context we see the

691
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,320
struggle for freedom

692
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,678
continuing there and so in a country

693
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,439
like belarus

694
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,280
right now we're seeing ordinary

695
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,080
belarusians express their

696
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,320
preferences for democratic freedoms in

697
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,559
the face of enormous repression

698
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,918
and in the face of years and years of

699
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,360
extraordinary

700
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,200
uh repression and control of ordinary

701
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,120
citizens aspirations there

702
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,080
and in that context we're seeing the use

703
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,158
of digital technologies in a in a really

704
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,600
important and positive sense

705
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,280
for people to be able to express

706
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,039
themselves and i think part of

707
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,320
the challenge we're going to face going

708
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,879
forward again not

709
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,520
as a soul challenge among the many that

710
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,840
have

711
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,039
hit any number of societies over the

712
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,320
past years

713
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,480
i think one of the things we're really

714
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,320
going to have to reckon with is how

715
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,720
to sustain the positive aspects

716
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,240
of the digital uh technological

717
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,480
revolution while

718
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,720
dealing with in a meaningful way the

719
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,760
more toxic and harmful aspects of this

720
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,400
that are both

721
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,799
driving um and accelerating and

722
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,440
amplifying anger some of which is

723
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:10,720
already there and otherwise debilitating

724
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,400
open society's capacity for meaningful

725
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,919
and reasonable discussion in order to

726
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,919
come to

727
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,919
solutions to these very complicated

728
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,360
problems and i think it's fair to say

729
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,919
that

730
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,439
many societies are arriving at an

731
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,400
inflection point when it comes to

732
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
sorting out

733
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,720
these real challenges that have emerged

734
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,120
in the social and economic context

735
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,840
but also as it relates to how

736
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,158
information is consumed and used

737
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,080
in these settings in a way that would be

738
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,480
more consistent with liberal democratic

739
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,480
values

740
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,678
okay thank you very much so

741
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,720
this was a very valuable contribution in

742
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,320
a way that

743
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,720
as far as i understood you've said that

744
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,158
we are indeed lying in front of the

745
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,080
crossroads

746
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,360
not only in the offline world but also

747
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,360
in the online world um

748
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,279
so let me follow up on that and ask

749
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,039
laura

750
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:12,080
whether you think that while

751
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,960
the crisis um might

752
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,279
uncover uh these these vulnerabilities

753
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,919
and these weak points and the societies

754
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,799
um whether uh this is also an

755
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,760
opportunity

756
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,320
uh for the for for for the people to

757
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
actually

758
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,480
or to work with the people whether

759
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,520
whether people are initially

760
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,159
more tempted to to to to change their

761
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,158
opinions

762
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,679
under under the pressure of the crisis

763
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,200
that's such an interesting question and

764
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,640
i think joanna brought up something

765
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
interesting when she talked about how

766
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
this governance gap at this point in

767
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,360
time

768
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,880
is um it really points to the effects of

769
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,399
distrust in government

770
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
unfortunately one of the things that we

771
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,720
found in a survey that we released only

772
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,240
yesterday

773
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,360
is that at least in some countries

774
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,799
there's a partisan view of how

775
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,559
different leaders have responded to the

776
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,679
kobit 19 crisis

777
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,918
we only were able to survey this year um

778
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,440
in phone countries because of the global

779
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,840
pandemic we couldn't send interviewers

780
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,200
face to face i'm sure everyone

781
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,120
understands but so in the countries that

782
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
we did survey which are predominantly

783
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,199
in europe one of the things that we

784
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,120
found is that in the us and the uk

785
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,480
people's evaluations of how well coveted

786
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,199
19 has been dealt with in their

787
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,640
countries

788
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,880
is completely filtered through a

789
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,559
partisan lens and so while i think there

790
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,679
could be potentially some opportunities

791
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,520
and some recognition

792
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,600
that trust and science is important and

793
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,200
trust in institutions is important

794
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,678
that's not necessarily enough to break

795
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,880
through people's distrust of certain

796
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,880
elites and certain institutions um

797
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,559
as we're speaking about for example

798
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,600
trust in elites it's important to note

799
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,840
that depending on

800
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,000
who you talk to the elites are not just

801
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,799
the people in parliament or the people

802
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,480
in congress

803
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,840
the elites sometimes extend and we've

804
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,520
learned this through focus groups that

805
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,799
we've conducted in numerous countries

806
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,480
they extend to the people running the

807
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,080
banks or the people who are in charge of

808
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,360
the economic policy to get us out of the

809
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,000
kovit 19 crisis

810
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,639
or especially to the media and in a time

811
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,120
of increased

812
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,880
media choice and media fracture as well

813
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,639
as just the proliferation of

814
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,559
entertainment options so people don't

815
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,679
have to consume the same information as

816
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,480
their neighbors

817
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,120
it's a really difficult scenario to see

818
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,760
how

819
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,479
um how we can break out of even with

820
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,799
this major

821
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,559
disruptive event covid19 that in some

822
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,720
places has definitely led to

823
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,320
decreased polarization that just hasn't

824
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,880
been uniform across all of the countries

825
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,879
that we study

826
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,960
thank you i would like to follow up on

827
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,039
the um

828
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,120
on the fact that uh you mentioned that

829
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,120
uh what is the definition of of the

830
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,840
elites or the perception of the elites

831
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,239
um

832
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,480
and one of the leads you mentioned are

833
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,200
the economic elites so bankers um

834
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,320
and also our data show that people feel

835
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,559
like there is a strong

836
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,600
oligarchic influence over the government

837
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,120
so do you believe

838
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,120
one of those um one of those redefining

839
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,559
versions of the game should be a more

840
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,639
more strong or stronger um economic

841
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,399
intervention stronger economic reforms

842
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,760
uh in europe and scandinavia they're

843
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,600
already ongoing

844
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,240
uh some um um

845
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,039
experiments such as uh universal basic

846
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,520
income or

847
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,480
or taxation stronger taxation of of the

848
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,360
large companies

849
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,360
uh joanna

850
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,159
so i think that's a really difficult

851
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,919
question to pose for a global answer

852
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,000
right just because the approaches are so

853
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,520
significantly different i mean

854
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,120
the on i will i refrain from commenting

855
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,000
on us

856
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,439
politics say writ large but it is it is

857
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,720
hard to imagine

858
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,120
support for universal basic

859
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,960
income since there's already such a

860
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,840
discussion about universal health care

861
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,880
which is

862
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,720
a given in a lot of the other countries

863
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,480
that that laura mentioned in the survey

864
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,279
i mean in europe it's it's

865
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,760
universal medicine is is obvious right

866
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,799
so

867
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,080
so i i i would be loath to give such

868
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,399
a low huge huge answer if we if we bring

869
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,600
it

870
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:09,120
to i think that what you can say

871
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,080
um and i would suspect that part of

872
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,600
the distrust in elites particularly in

873
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,760
the banking sector in terms of you know

874
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,639
oligarchs and and whatnot

875
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,480
is a lack of transparency frankly which

876
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,840
so which should lead a little bit to a

877
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,679
to a governance well right

878
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,520
lack of transparency i'm not part of it

879
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:30,240
and increasing that

880
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,559
could perhaps be um a more gentle way

881
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,640
to go if without talking about direct

882
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,000
economic interventions which again

883
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,679
i'm not i'm not uh

884
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,679
for one well-placed but for too

885
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,480
skeptical about the implementability of

886
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,000
that across

887
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,840
all of the spectrum of countries that

888
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
we're just talking about

889
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,199
um but the but the one thing that

890
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,679
certainly

891
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,200
in terms of the governance gaps and and

892
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,080
in terms of the

893
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,000
um distrust towards generally and this

894
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,799
is also the absolute breeding ground

895
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,919
for for any kind of disinformation

896
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,000
malign influence

897
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,760
is the lack of transparency people feel

898
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,120
that their interests aren't being

899
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,799
represented because

900
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,120
they don't know right because they

901
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,360
figure that there's some shadowy

902
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,600
how'd you say global conspiracy theories

903
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,918
of cosmopolitan elites is nothing new

904
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,360
this has been going on forever so i mean

905
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,880
i think that we're seeing kind of like a

906
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,840
2020 version

907
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,640
of this um you know if you want to start

908
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,760
putting

909
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,159
other um other phobias on top of it

910
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,000
that's

911
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,080
fine but i mean ultimately what it ends

912
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,919
up coming down to is that if you don't

913
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,879
understand and if it's not

914
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,000
transparently clear how certain

915
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,840
mechanisms take

916
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,320
place and how the certain decisions are

917
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,279
made i mean having 100 transparency is

918
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,200
also obviously

919
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,279
inefficient but certainly more than

920
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,240
exists now i mean i think that you know

921
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,640
a lot of the

922
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,640
a lot of the countries have been quite

923
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,360
pains walking through the problem

924
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,799
mixed with how how effective it has been

925
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,399
but you know for example

926
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,320
you know the call for greater

927
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,719
accountability on the part of

928
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,600
european bureaucrats as we saw played

929
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,080
out quite

930
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,439
quite dramatically the other day when

931
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,559
there was

932
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,399
depending on the version that you're

933
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,519
looking for either the firing of or the

934
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,279
walking away

935
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,200
of a senior minister due to breaking

936
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,720
you know breaking breaking the rules on

937
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,519
covid

938
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,880
so that's that's my kind of long answer

939
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,559
to it but i mean again

940
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,240
direct economic interventions i don't

941
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,399
think are necessarily

942
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,440
realistic across this entirely huge

943
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,760
playing field but

944
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,080
certainly a greater rigor of

945
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,080
transparency and at least the

946
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,080
feeling of greater accountability i

947
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,399
think would go a long way to closing the

948
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,399
governance gaps quite broadly

949
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,518
thank you so greater transparency and

950
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,879
accountability and transparency as i

951
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,519
understood across

952
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,080
you know uh across the different sectors

953
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,480
so

954
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,399
on the internet um also within the

955
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,600
governments in the governance systems

956
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,158
and and and in the finance sector um

957
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,158
chris when it comes to solutions um as

958
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,960
joanna already started uh where would

959
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,480
you see

960
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,720
um um what we should do in

961
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,240
in order to to address this disconnect

962
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,640
how can we strengthen the resilience of

963
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,440
democracies

964
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,039
so i think the you know it's important

965
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,200
as the other speakers have noted to

966
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,799
distinguish i think between

967
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,480
um some of the countries we're

968
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,360
discussing which are

969
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,840
closed authoritarian systems and whose

970
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,399
people

971
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,320
are struggling for greater democratic

972
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,918
freedoms and then the

973
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,559
considerable number of countries in the

974
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,640
recent past which have experienced

975
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,320
a democratic decline to one form or

976
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,519
another for a variety of reasons i think

977
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,360
many of these

978
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,360
have been touched upon some of them have

979
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,360
to do with

980
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,120
deep feelings of uncertainty and

981
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,840
insecurity that have been driven by

982
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,199
globalization in an economic sense in a

983
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,279
social sense

984
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,720
and also in a technological sense and i

985
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,600
think these things to one degree or

986
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,559
another

987
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,080
are reinforcing each other for example

988
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,120
in the

989
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,039
digital um technological sense

990
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,239
in the social media sense there there's

991
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,559
research and evidence to suggest that

992
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,919
much of the discussion that's done in

993
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,960
political terms

994
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,640
can inspire uh anger through use of

995
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,559
emotion and manipulation

996
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,640
i think part of what we need to do on

997
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,840
that count in order to find

998
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,679
solutions over the longer term is to

999
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,760
find efforts that can systematically

1000
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,600
adapt the digital space improve the

1001
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,519
digital space so that

1002
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,439
it's less prone to manipulation and

1003
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,679
information pollution and that's

1004
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,039
that's no easy thing i think the the

1005
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,000
initiatives that have

1006
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,320
gotten underway uh on a number of fronts

1007
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,360
in recent years are incredibly important

1008
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,279
some of these

1009
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,840
are being driven by the governments

1010
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,679
within democracies some of these are

1011
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,120
being undertaken to one degree or

1012
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,440
another

1013
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,959
in the commercial sector not quickly

1014
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,799
enough in most cases

1015
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,200
but civil society really plays a

1016
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,760
critical role on so many fronts here

1017
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,800
to help the general public understand

1018
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,839
the issues

1019
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,520
to share information to help educate on

1020
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,239
what are invariably very

1021
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,839
complicated issues i think this is a big

1022
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,399
part of the way that

1023
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,199
we develop the sort of resilience over

1024
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,879
time

1025
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,839
having the expertise having the

1026
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,879
understanding so that our societies can

1027
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,199
have

1028
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,239
a less polarized more meaningful

1029
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,158
discussion

1030
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,560
to reach some form of consensus which

1031
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,679
has become really difficult in so many

1032
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,480
settings i would suspect

1033
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,760
all things being equal in the recent

1034
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,960
decade or so

1035
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,560
this has just become almost impossible

1036
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,399
in many places and i don't think that

1037
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,359
was the expectation

1038
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,319
looking from say 2005 or so i think

1039
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,159
there was a

1040
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,320
different view of how things would

1041
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,800
emerge and now we're in the midst of it

1042
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,520
we're

1043
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,280
wrestling to develop uh approaches that

1044
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,599
can deal with these issues

1045
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,560
i think it's going to be a

1046
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,720
multi-dimensional response

1047
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,960
to meet a multi-dimensional challenge

1048
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,839
some of this will have to do with

1049
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,400
more transparency in the media sector in

1050
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,119
the tech sector in the financial sector

1051
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,760
in democracies that are behind on that

1052
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,960
count

1053
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,880
i think i would note that um you know in

1054
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,880
central europe and it's not unique to

1055
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,240
central or southeastern europe

1056
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,320
the merger or the overlap between

1057
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,399
commercial political and media interests

1058
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,440
has grown more acute and this is

1059
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,079
something that this is

1060
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,280
is not very healthy for democratic

1061
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,359
accountability

1062
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,800
and it's not unique to to that region

1063
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,520
and i think this is something

1064
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,160
we have to reflect very seriously on uh

1065
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,040
in terms of reforms and getting to a

1066
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,118
situation

1067
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,920
in which this sort of overlap and

1068
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,280
intersection is less visible in many

1069
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,720
parts of the world so

1070
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
for a very difficult set of

1071
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,839
multi-dimensional challenges i think

1072
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,079
we're going to

1073
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,040
need to settle on some multi-dimensional

1074
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,480
responses

1075
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,480
to address these over time

1076
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,200
thank you definitely a hollow society

1077
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,359
approach

1078
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,439
will be needed here to to address all

1079
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,640
the all the multi-dimensional

1080
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,320
problems laura

1081
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,960
what would you suggest

1082
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,599
needs to be fixing needs to be fixed

1083
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,200
knowing

1084
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,680
that or having studied um

1085
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,240
the attitudes and perceptions of of of

1086
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,919
people

1087
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,879
all across the world i think one of the

1088
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,040
things that we

1089
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,119
see is most correlated with democratic

1090
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,680
dissatisfaction or the two things really

1091
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,000
are a comfort with diversity and

1092
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,359
multiculturalism

1093
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,800
um and generally thinking that there are

1094
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,560
economic opportunities

1095
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,320
and neither of those are easy fixes and

1096
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,160
neither of those can be fixed

1097
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,160
in the same way across every country

1098
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,799
certainly i'm obviously

1099
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,759
relatively familiar with the u.s case

1100
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,839
but

1101
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,160
when we think about these issues and

1102
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,240
when candidates campaign on these issues

1103
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,359
we generally see that people end up

1104
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,720
divided

1105
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,640
and polarization has increased in the us

1106
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,720
quite rapidly over the last two decades

1107
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,400
or so and so

1108
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,839
i don't have a solution and that's not

1109
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,520
necessarily something that pew research

1110
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,200
center participates in but those are

1111
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,800
definitely two of the correlates that we

1112
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,359
see with dissatisfaction that are some

1113
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,520
of the

1114
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,359
most difficult to resolve obviously but

1115
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,520
also the most fundamental

1116
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,880
um if people have a sense that they have

1117
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,000
opportunities and that their children

1118
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,839
have opportunities

1119
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,680
and if they're comfortable with the

1120
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,400
other people being represented right

1121
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,000
because

1122
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,000
multiculturalism and representative

1123
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,440
democracy necessitate that you

1124
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,200
feel like everyone should have their

1125
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,320
voices represented and everyone should

1126
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,240
be equal

1127
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,520
so a tolerance for people who are

1128
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,839
different than you is definitely

1129
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,520
something that's incredibly important

1130
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,520
i don't have solutions for these but i

1131
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,200
would say that these core core issues

1132
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,960
are definitely fundamental

1133
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,319
particularly in the united states just

1134
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,359
because of my own background knowing

1135
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,880
about that one but

1136
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,480
generally in all of the countries that

1137
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,599
we study they tend to be the greatest

1138
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,280
predictors of

1139
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,839
comfort with representative democracy

1140
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,839
and satisfaction

1141
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,079
thank you and could a media player play

1142
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,279
a role in this and

1143
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,480
how to um make sure that that

1144
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,480
that we keep the the independent

1145
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,240
and and and uh how we sorry once again

1146
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,320
could the media play a role in this and

1147
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:29,040
how should we make sure that

1148
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:32,320
that we uh keep the independent media

1149
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,599
um and also in the countries uh where

1150
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,720
the media is either being suppressed or

1151
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,240
or or very much polarized um

1152
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,560
chris would you like to answer the

1153
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,560
question

1154
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,359
well i i and my observations have

1155
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,200
gravitated and

1156
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,200
focused a bit on the media and tech

1157
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,879
aspect of this because i think it's

1158
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,879
it's fundamental among the many

1159
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,720
questions and to the extent

1160
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,359
as laura noted that open societies that

1161
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,319
have the ability to discuss these issues

1162
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,279
can't reach some meaningful consensus

1163
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,640
and to the extent

1164
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,920
the polarization is too acute to

1165
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,680
settle on public policy solutions that

1166
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,680
address these very serious needs that

1167
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,520
have emerged in recent years

1168
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,200
we really have our work cut out for us i

1169
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,240
think the good news is

1170
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,078
and joanna touched on this earlier that

1171
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,000
in some ways these extraordinary

1172
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,079
challenges that

1173
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,599
are confronting us now even preceding

1174
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,760
the covet 19

1175
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,880
pandemic we've we've had we've had very

1176
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,920
significant

1177
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,560
challenges to democracy for uh many many

1178
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,800
years now

1179
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,640
going back i would say at least by

1180
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,320
freedom houses lights at least a decade

1181
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,200
and a half

1182
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,960
these require some dedicated serious

1183
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,960
solutions i think there's a growing

1184
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,119
number of people who recognize

1185
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,280
the acute nature of these challenges the

1186
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,400
need to address them in a meaningful way

1187
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,760
and among those responses to have

1188
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,280
information that's credible independent

1189
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,520
and can be relied upon for

1190
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,880
addressing these serious challenges some

1191
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,640
of which are

1192
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,480
directly related to public health

1193
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,560
concerns people's families

1194
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,880
their well-being i think this is helping

1195
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,599
to stimulate more of a recognition

1196
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,920
of just how important this is uh getting

1197
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,480
to

1198
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,400
meaningful solutions and improvement

1199
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,400
will be a real challenge and we have our

1200
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,520
work cut out for us because

1201
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,440
the extent of time that

1202
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,960
these challenges have been developing

1203
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,040
and i alluded to this

1204
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,800
the financial in my view the financial

1205
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,359
crisis of 2008

1206
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,000
deepened and accelerated some already

1207
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,640
profound

1208
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,920
challenges to independent media in open

1209
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,440
societies

1210
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,720
it made them more acute in closed

1211
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,040
societies as well and in those places

1212
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,240
the authoritarians who have resources at

1213
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,240
their disposal

1214
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,839
invariably make that a priority we've

1215
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,680
seen this in russia and china

1216
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:00,240
and elsewhere that may change as well

1217
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,240
over time my guess is it will but for

1218
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,078
democratic societies and other open

1219
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,078
societies it's really

1220
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,839
a challenge we need to reckon with on

1221
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,520
how we can

1222
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,440
um reboot in a sense our information

1223
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,680
systems our independent media

1224
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,760
in ways that meet the needs of

1225
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,319
democratic societies and allow us to

1226
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,440
have

1227
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,560
meaningful debates that are civil and

1228
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,599
allow us to arrive at solutions that

1229
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,440
meet people's needs

1230
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,960
thank you very much uh we have three

1231
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,480
minutes uh until the end of the

1232
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,359
discussion so i would just

1233
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,240
like to post the last question to to all

1234
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,759
of you

1235
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,040
um whether you think

1236
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,280
the glass is um half full of or half

1237
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,640
empty are you more positive or

1238
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:52,960
about the future

1239
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,960
joanna can we start with you please

1240
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,680
so i usually i usually um define myself

1241
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,560
as a realist frankly i would not

1242
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,399
be in the job that i have held for over

1243
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,960
20 years if i wasn't optimistic

1244
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,560
in some way um i think that you just

1245
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,839
have to take a very long

1246
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:15,359
view of the issues that we have

1247
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,200
um and that eventually things

1248
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,560
do turn out the way that they should

1249
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,279
even with

1250
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,799
dips along along the road so so

1251
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,119
ultimately

1252
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,880
i'm somehow optimistic though though

1253
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,520
often people don't think i am

1254
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,079
um that being said you know you do have

1255
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,319
to be

1256
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,400
very realistic in the assessment of how

1257
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,319
deep the problems are polarization is a

1258
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,280
terrible problem and frankly in a lot of

1259
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,520
these places

1260
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,440
the fish does rot from the head and so

1261
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,960
therefore the tone that is set

1262
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,000
by um by political leadership in any

1263
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,119
country

1264
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,680
um and how that ends up going flowing

1265
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,440
into the media sector and to what

1266
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,359
you know there is an onus on the elves

1267
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,040
to acknowledge and address

1268
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,598
these issues um so i will end on

1269
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,920
and on and on that and i mean hopefully

1270
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,680
again that this this global pandemic was

1271
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,359
perhaps a wake-up call at least for some

1272
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,960
of them so there is an opportunity for

1273
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,000
populists obviously

1274
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,960
but populists ultimately don't propose

1275
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,960
long-term solutions right and they also

1276
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,480
don't necessarily create the problems

1277
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,200
which means that the onus is

1278
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,960
on those public servants elected or

1279
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,078
appointed or whatever but public

1280
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,800
servants that

1281
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,920
ultimately have a state's interest in

1282
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,200
mind and the citizenry

1283
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,839
you might have to step up and

1284
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,319
begin with fixing themselves ultimately

1285
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,680
before

1286
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,680
you look to fix the rest of it

1287
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,760
thank you laura may i ask you to limit

1288
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,598
your intervention to one minute

1289
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,800
i would say that i'm very interested to

1290
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,880
see different

1291
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,240
policy options that can be undertaken i

1292
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,440
think chris alluded to some of the

1293
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,439
potential regulation

1294
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,960
of social media i think that could be a

1295
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,880
really interesting thing to change what

1296
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,319
people are exposed to and what tools

1297
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,760
they have to organize in an

1298
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,079
anti-democratic way

1299
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,160
i've also been very interested to see

1300
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,160
citizen assemblies and other forms

1301
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,598
of kind of democratic interventions that

1302
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,520
people may or may not be taking

1303
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,280
opportunities to participate in

1304
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,560
um i'm very curious to see how those

1305
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,280
will affect change

1306
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,720
as a as a person i feel very optimistic

1307
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,920
looking at the data i think it'll take

1308
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,879
very skilled leadership

1309
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,680
because i basically agree with joanna

1310
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,079
that

1311
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,799
the the onus often is on political

1312
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,960
leaders

1313
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,960
because publics tend to follow elite

1314
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,079
rhetoric on key issues especially that

1315
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,839
they don't have personal

1316
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:38,400
experience with thank you

1317
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:41,839
chris and i'm optimistic as well i think

1318
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,079
we are at a period now where um

1319
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,680
many societies that i think took certain

1320
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,880
things for granted

1321
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,480
are starting to reflect on the fact that

1322
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,720
uh you need to pay attention in a

1323
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,680
democracy you need to

1324
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,319
fight to maintain uh freedoms that have

1325
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,879
been won

1326
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,240
and i'm talking of democracies all over

1327
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,599
the world we've had a discussion

1328
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,919
globally now

1329
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,880
um and i think this is this is a point

1330
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,040
at which

1331
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,400
looking from a post-cold war period we

1332
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,839
need to reflect and

1333
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,079
we're starting to reflect in open

1334
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,400
societies on what sort of commitment

1335
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,359
is required to sustain and renew and

1336
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,800
refresh

1337
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,560
democratic systems so i'm very

1338
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,760
optimistic on that count and i'm equally

1339
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,599
optimistic

1340
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,880
on what we're seeing in any number of

1341
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,640
other settings

1342
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,720
where societies have lived under

1343
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,598
repression and authoritarianism

1344
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,799
where they're starting to express their

1345
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,640
preferences

1346
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,000
in ways that are quite clear and i

1347
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,118
alluded to

1348
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,160
belarus earlier there are hundreds of

1349
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,839
thousands of people

1350
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,160
coming out on the streets to express

1351
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,000
their preferences in my view

1352
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,200
for democratic freedoms in the face of

1353
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,440
extraordinary

1354
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,279
repression and brutality and i think

1355
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,680
that just should remind us who are

1356
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,760
already living in democratic societies

1357
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,680
of these aspirations being global

1358
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,920
and we should support them

1359
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,799
