1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,439
uh and business administration

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,480
administration from ben gurion

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,200
university of the

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,960
negev he also holds a master degree in

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
public administration from john kennedy

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,120
school

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,519
of government at harvard university so

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,560
we'll come both

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,198
so the deal from the 13th of august

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,080
between israel and uae

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,199
sponsored the united states has sent

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,400
huge waves and

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,960
not only across the region it has been

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,119
named

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,239
named the peace deal normalization

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,239
agreement

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,399
betrayal and destruction of arab peace

18
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,078
initiative or even a bazaar deal

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,040
depending on whom you talk to but if you

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,719
leave all this cement behind we are left

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,480
with the fact that even

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,039
it's not a strategic reversal in either

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,800
in the course of either of the actors

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,760
the deal might be a real

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,038
paradigm shift and not only an

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,320
israeli-palestinian issue

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,520
but in the regional power balance even

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,440
the fact that

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,320
the negotiations have been ongoing

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,158
between the two countries since 2015

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,919
and the deal is only a public

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,720
acknowledgement and exposure of

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
already existing good relations between

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,360
between the countries

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,600
um what is different now why we are why

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,960
we are having the deal now

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,280
uh how would you describe this defined

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,439
as

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,759
uh from uae perspective after some if i

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,279
can

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,600
ask you if i can start with you

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
thank you sylvia it's pleasure uh to be

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,000
with you and thanks for

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,720
globalsec for this uh

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,200
invitation well i will i would i would

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,079
say that this built him as a throwing a

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,119
stone in

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,320
stagnant uh water

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,759
from my perspective it is a growing

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,039
changer really

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,079
and uh

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,079
although the timing that uh

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:06,240
people they are looking at it is

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:10,000
because of the u.s presidential election

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,560
but in my uh view

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,680
as a political ideology no strategy

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,520
can be based on short-term calculation

58
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,200
this deal actually came to to reflect

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,080
the rational and realistic political

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,599
process

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,280
that is deeper and much mature than

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,760
uh that presumed

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,480
link between the presidential election

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,840
and

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,840
and uh entity exactly

66
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,359
thank you thank you some amos what you

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,040
would like to

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
how how do you see it from from the

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,560
israeli perspective why

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:57,200
why now why we are having this deal now

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:00,640
why now it's a tough year 2020

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,640
a pademic health crisis

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,879
economic crisis a political crisis

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,079
and we really needed some good news

75
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,840
so that's i say simply why now

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,120
because we need some good news and

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,000
this deal and you absolutely right

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,959
it's still only a deal it's not yet an

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
agreement

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,280
it's not yet a formal normalization

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
but this deal is achieving and if i will

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,480
take

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,480
if the sum

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,159
speaking about a stone it's basically

85
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,518
a killed in a positive way

86
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,280
two birds in one stone it's have stopped

87
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,400
annexation

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,720
which was a negative pos a procedure

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
that could lead to instability in the

90
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,920
middle east

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,959
and it achieved the third

92
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,518
normalization or peace between

93
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,560
israel and arab country so looking at it

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,519
today on the short term it's very very

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,239
important

96
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,439
and i'm hoping so much that in the

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,720
future

98
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:22,079
it will show us that we can

99
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:26,560
achieve a peace that is not only

100
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:30,240
between two leaders it's a peace between

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,600
two people so the people in

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,880
the uae and in israel will do what we

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,479
are unable to do

104
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,560
with unfortunately with egypt and jordan

105
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,599
uh create a warm peace peace that will

106
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,160
encourage each other

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,759
to visit each other to know each other

108
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,160
as a human being

109
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:58,880
to have a partnership on economic

110
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,600
endeavors to do a student exchange

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,560
tourism if one day we can be flying

112
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
again

113
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,240
so i think the hope for the long run is

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,680
to show

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,000
the arabs and the israelis and everybody

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,360
in the

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,960
world that peace is much better

118
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
than hostility and war

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,039
thank you in your paper you recently

120
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
recently penned you are praising the

121
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,320
deal but you are also calling for a

122
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
cautious optimism

123
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,080
so in what what do you see the caveats

124
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,758
of peace deal

125
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,840
between the two countries which are

126
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,080
never been at war and are

127
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,280
so it what kind what kind of peace and

128
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,680
how

129
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,679
can it be can it can it be achieved

130
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,359
i think that the uae has shown

131
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,800
a lot of courage and leadership

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,560
because in this triangle the us and

133
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,160
israel

134
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:02,639
is about going to election

135
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:06,160
and trump and netanyahu needed

136
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,280
an achievement a positive

137
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,639
achievement the uae

138
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,719
is has a leader that look

139
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:20,160
into the future and want to show

140
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,840
the neighborhood what are already

141
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,960
described that new relation should

142
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,080
create a base for peace why

143
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
i'm cautiously optimistic because it's

144
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,599
go

145
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,960
against what happened in the middle east

146
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,600
in the last 20 years since the arab

147
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,440
peace initiative

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:47,199
in 2002 that came in the middle

149
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,360
of the bloodshed of the second intifada

150
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,560
and nobody really pay attention to it

151
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,680
but

152
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,840
it gave a

153
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,759
veto to the palestinians on the relation

154
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,198
and normalization of israel with the

155
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,240
arab world

156
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,759
and it's led to 20

157
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,960
years that we wasted or not moving

158
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,199
forward

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:17,120
and i do hope that other countries

160
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:21,280
in the middle east will follow the uae

161
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,680
leadership which in a way

162
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,318
can help solve the israeli-palestinian

163
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,720
issue

164
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,039
but i i'm sure you will ask about it

165
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,759
later

166
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,960
uh you mentioned the palestinian issue

167
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,039
uh

168
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,560
you said you said recently that

169
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,360
palestinians were given

170
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,639
golden opportunity as the annexation

171
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,840
talks had been

172
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:48,000
had been halted however

173
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,080
palestinians uh it seems that all

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
fractions of palestinians

175
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,159
um they unite against the deal so what

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,759
is it what they don't see what uh

177
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
what would you what would you say about

178
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,599
adaptation

179
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,680
well serbia accusing uae of

180
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,599
betrayal by by all the palestinian

181
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,400
fiction is an irrational accusation and

182
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,120
and not

183
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,679
based on on the logic of strategic

184
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,440
analysis of the middle eastern

185
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,960
landscape if we apply

186
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,280
the what-if methodology we will

187
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,680
realize that the lack of uh

188
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,880
normalization of relations between

189
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,240
israel and the arab countries over the

190
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,958
past decades

191
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,479
has not moved the palestinian-israeli

192
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,239
peace process

193
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,480
forward and has not achieved

194
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,480
any gains for palestinians so

195
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,080
normalization between the uae and

196
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,880
israel might move this process forward

197
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:03,440
or at worst things will remain the same

198
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:07,040
the deadlock uh in regional relations

199
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,320
has not led to any gains for anyone

200
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,079
so therefore uae

201
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,600
has decided to think outside the box

202
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,680
hoping that the region uh

203
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:26,000
might move towards peace and prosperity

204
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,120
the uae peace whatever you want to say

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,200
thirty deal agreement with israel

206
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,399
is not aimed against any arab countries

207
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,839
uae calculation

208
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,920
do not include competing over the royal

209
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,080
with with the brother countries that

210
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,199
already have ties with israel

211
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,760
but you can call it that was mainly with

212
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,360
egypt

213
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,480
and jordan that you can call it

214
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
cold peace

215
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,560
thank you ali podekh

216
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,560
just wrote now that

217
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,959
the agreement is a great thing but uh it

218
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
wouldn't be

219
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,518
it wouldn't be enough uh and he's

220
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,720
actually suggesting that

221
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,240
it should be accompanied by an israeli

222
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,399
initiative

223
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
uh for resolving the palestinian issue

224
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,360
what do you what would you s

225
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,440
how what would be your suggestion

226
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,640
if uh if you were supposed to advise

227
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,320
something at this at this moment

228
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,760
you can start and i would like to hear

229
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,760
from at the sum as well or

230
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,720
up to some if you would like to continue

231
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,720
in what you were saying

232
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:48,880
as as as the the palestinian national

233
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,239
authority physician is rational i think

234
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,360
also the position of extremists inside

235
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,279
israel is also russian

236
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,560
so to continue building um

237
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,200
israel uh policies on the extremist

238
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,239
logic who leave israel an isolated

239
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,760
country

240
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,959
from its environment so uh

241
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,240
i was what was talking about people

242
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,959
be to people public to public so

243
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,279
i think that netanyahu's carriage and

244
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,959
the israeli institutions

245
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,920
that made this uh deal succeeded

246
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,880
will contribute in writing down a new

247
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,079
chapter

248
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,880
and history of israeli ties with the

249
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,880
region

250
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,839
on both sides there are extremists and

251
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,000
skeptics the emirati israeli dean

252
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:47,200
has the logic of both

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,959
uh we have learned from history

254
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,639
that whoever opposed people's interest

255
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:58,239
loses so as a result of uh

256
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,639
this deal we might see some changes in

257
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,920
power distribution inside israel

258
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,720
it is also likely that we might see a

259
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,680
revisit

260
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,399
of the historical perspective of the

261
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,319
conflict

262
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,120
and an adjustment of the prevailing

263
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,160
narrative

264
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,680
on each side towards the other

265
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,439
if this does not happen the treaty

266
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,519
will move slowly okay

267
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,440
so some say some say that uh

268
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,680
um this deal is perhaps replacing

269
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,399
changing the terms of uh

270
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,120
arab peace initiative and the two-state

271
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,240
solution

272
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,040
is now taken off the table amos

273
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,560
what do you what do you think about it

274
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,079
on the contrary

275
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,880
i think the arab peace initiative

276
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,319
problem

277
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,560
was that it was a dictate if israel will

278
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,440
agree to all the parameters that was

279
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,479
there

280
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,680
then there will be a normalization

281
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,800
and some people saw the trump plan also

282
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,160
as a dictates

283
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,199
some palestinians but i do remember

284
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,880
that in the night in january when trump

285
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,639
announced

286
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,920
his plan it was a peace plan

287
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,680
it was a base for negotiation

288
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,000
unfortunately the palestinian boycotted

289
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,439
the the process and the plan and the

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,639
relation with

291
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,320
the trump administration i do think

292
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,760
that there is now an opportunity to go

293
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,880
back to negotiation each side

294
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,120
will come with his own parameters

295
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,800
because what is the problem the problem

296
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,720
is that both

297
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,839
still 60 percent of the palestinians 60

298
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,120
of the israelis are believing

299
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,720
in two-state solution however

300
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,079
when they start to speak on the details

301
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,680
and the parameters

302
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,719
of the two-state solution the gap is

303
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,599
serious and very wide

304
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,199
so let's narrow the gap about the

305
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,880
two-state solution

306
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:16,639
let's bring the moderate

307
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,439
uh arabs the pragmatic arabs

308
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,320
with the palestinians to the negotiation

309
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,519
table

310
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:27,279
and try to start and narrow

311
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,560
the gap and try to think differently

312
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,760
because we haven't changed our thinking

313
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,599
since the previous century and we need

314
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,639
to be more innovative on new ideas

315
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,639
new realities on the ground and some

316
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,160
arrangements that can

317
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,480
bring us to the two-state uh solution

318
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,519
why i say the two-state solution is not

319
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,199
there

320
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:57,279
because the big achievement of the uae

321
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,680
is freezing annexation so not going to

322
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,240
one

323
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,359
state or not going to make the

324
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,399
palestinian

325
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,399
a future state

326
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,519
and not viable

327
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,800
in a way the fact that the uae

328
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,160
joined jordan and egypt give them a

329
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,279
leverage

330
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,319
against israelis future

331
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,199
steps that will kill the two-state

332
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,480
solution

333
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:30,560
idea so that's why i think uh

334
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,880
muhammad bin zayed deserve a lot

335
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,000
not from only from israel from the

336
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,439
palestinians

337
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,240
from those arabs who want a solution

338
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,880
and not continuation of what we are

339
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,920
having

340
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,199
in the last decade so

341
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:50,800
what both of you are saying is that uh

342
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,800
israeli uae deal is basically capable

343
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,560
of speeding up the two-state solutions

344
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,880
right solution right

345
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,239
so uh what would you say to those

346
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,560
countries who might or

347
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,120
are still thinking about following but

348
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,119
they are not sure about a

349
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
uae perspective how how would you

350
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
encourage uh

351
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,920
encourage other actors in the in the

352
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,920
region

353
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,519
up to some well if i make comment and i

354
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,639
will come to your question

355
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,279
that the deal constituted a strategic

356
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,639
shock

357
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,560
for for some regional players including

358
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,759
the the palestinian

359
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,758
national authority and reflected

360
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
a strategic shift in the relation

361
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,759
between the two parties

362
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,880
of the uh to the agreement so therefore

363
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,600
both sides

364
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,880
needs to capitalize on this shift to

365
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,720
help restore

366
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,000
the palestinian-israeli conflict

367
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,959
this makes perfect sense since

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,920
such conflict will remain a main

369
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,959
obstacle

370
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,519
in the way of implementing the the

371
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,518
agreement of course not to mention that

372
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,839
the settlement of this issue will push

373
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,760
the other arab countries to follow the

374
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,760
uae uh approach

375
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,319
so since the deal came as a result of

376
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,879
thinking outside the box both

377
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,799
palestinian and israelis

378
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:22,000
need to have an a ideas

379
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:26,000
and courage similar to those that led to

380
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,360
to the conclusion of of uh deal between

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,400
uae and nazareth israel's decision

382
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,600
to freeze annexation will give the

383
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,960
palestinian

384
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,240
and israelis the chance to

385
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,600
rethink the peace process and often

386
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,880
channels for

387
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:49,240
strategic dialogue and negotiation

388
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:52,640
in a bid to reach a a solution to their

389
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:56,880
long-standing conflict if no solutions

390
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:00,160
scenario resist with the continuing

391
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,200
israeli unilaterally measures such as

392
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,480
the latest

393
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:09,440
annexation plan this will make

394
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:12,320
tel aviv strategically pay a high price

395
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,960
by the way this assistant is shared by

396
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,200
the

397
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,720
some israeli think times where almost

398
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,559
belong

399
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:24,480
inss the successful implementation

400
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,760
of the deal and the the normalization of

401
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,960
relation

402
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,160
based on process

403
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,520
of building trust

404
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,160
founded upon rational

405
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,960
calculation will encourage arab parties

406
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,240
and

407
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,679
u.s to push the negotiation process

408
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,799
between the palestinian and israeli

409
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,840
sides forward

410
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:53,520
in a practical manner that leads

411
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,080
to durable solution now i mentioned that

412
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,280
between ages between jordan and israel

413
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,159
that was

414
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,000
called peace it means that it was not

415
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,600
people to people

416
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,960
here in the case of uae we we didn't

417
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,320
have a war

418
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:14,160
with israel so and

419
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,200
and we don't have and as i said also to

420
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,960
another group

421
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,960
yesterday discussing the same issue

422
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,880
we have a young generation and the young

423
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,919
generation did not witness

424
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,960
the wars the arab wars with israel

425
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,440
okay plus of course uh

426
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,440
the the

427
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
the palestinian case it's not the

428
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,600
priority now

429
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,639
after the arab spring

430
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,678
palestinian case back

431
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,760
in each country each countries have

432
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,440
their problem they are thinking

433
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,240
about their problem this is their

434
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,240
priority you have

435
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,840
many things to do so the young

436
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,360
generation i mentioned

437
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,639
they and and i saw them so maybe this

438
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,039
this normalization

439
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,799
people to people which did not happen

440
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,879
and the previous cases

441
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,520
uh with with the arab countries did

442
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,559
peace

443
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,080
uh agreement with israel might might

444
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,918
encourage the others

445
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,280
when if they see the the outcome the

446
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,000
successful outcome

447
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,280
coming from this deal this is will

448
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,640
encourage them

449
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,678
the normalization if israel also and

450
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,919
this is of course

451
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,720
it takes two to the standard this will

452
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,679
demand not only in uae it will depend

453
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,960
also

454
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,360
in israel convincing the arab world

455
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,240
that it's really wonder normalization

456
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,678
and peace

457
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,840
and stop that any kind of violence

458
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,640
against

459
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,639
palestine but the reaction is not coming

460
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,880
only from uh

461
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,720
from palestinian side it's or other

462
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,919
quarters it's it's coming also for

463
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,039
instance from

464
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,440
part of the liquid party almost right uh

465
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,400
some people they are claimed that or say

466
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
that uh

467
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,919
netanyahu promised annexation and had he

468
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,520
delivered

469
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,159
direct flights to abu dhabi uh

470
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,158
well to them

471
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,280
yeah i i think we

472
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:28,479
please well i just wanted to say

473
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,960
that this is a took a carriage from both

474
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
sides

475
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,240
from sheikh mohammed bin zayed from

476
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,039
prison

477
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,760
from netanyahu prime minister netanyahu

478
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,280
because

479
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,480
both of them look at it at its a win-win

480
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,000
deal for both of them and it

481
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,360
deserves all sacrifice from anybody

482
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,720
either blaming uae from arabs or blaming

483
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,918
israeli from

484
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,880
uh inside israeli cod

485
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,200
part to have such a game changer it

486
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,200
really

487
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,799
to your question i think if it will be

488
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,000
brought to the israeli

489
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,039
knesset to be approved uh it will be

490
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,039
overwhelming

491
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:18,879
majority including liquid i will

492
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:22,158
assess 90 out of 120

493
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:27,840
there is like 10 percent extreme

494
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:30,400
right mostly settlers and there is the

495
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,199
15 members of the knesset which are

496
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,480
arabs

497
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,600
and they get most of their

498
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,520
political guidance from ramallah and we

499
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,158
don't understand but ramallah is against

500
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,039
it

501
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,159
but most of the israelis support it most

502
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,919
of the israelis

503
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:53,200
realized that annexation

504
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,200
is a bad idea it's a it's a poison

505
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:02,159
option with a very short expiration date

506
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,440
january 20th 21st but i think we

507
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,159
we spoke too much on the

508
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,200
israeli-palestinian issue

509
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,080
and we have to look at how the uae and

510
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,640
israel

511
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,840
looking at other issues in the middle

512
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,840
east

513
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:21,678
and in this respect we basically

514
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,879
share a lot of values we share a lot of

515
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,600
interests

516
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
and i hope we will be able to create

517
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,000
trust

518
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:34,159
because this is the three pillars of uh

519
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,120
two countries uh having a normalization

520
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,559
and alliance i think we are two small

521
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,000
countries

522
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,799
uh we are countries that

523
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,640
look for peace we countries that look

524
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,559
for modernization

525
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,559
we countries that look for moderation

526
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:57,760
and we have enemies common enemies iran

527
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,240
mostly and all the iranian

528
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,480
allies in the middle east which are

529
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,120
hezbollah and some

530
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,520
iranian foxes all over the place in

531
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,120
yemen and iraq in syria

532
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,320
we have a isis the radical

533
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,039
islamists which are both enemies of

534
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,200
israel

535
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,240
and uae and we have the muslim

536
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,000
brotherhood

537
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:26,080
uh as a ideologies that both

538
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,400
are not happy with so based on values

539
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,199
and based on interest i think this

540
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,320
alliance

541
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,440
has a potential for a future long

542
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,559
cooperation

543
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,159
if there will be trust

544
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:44,399
between the leaders and the people

545
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,960
this is a challenge still in front of us

546
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,320
this is uh it's it's great to hear an

547
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,679
eye to the uh

548
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,520
uh poll conducted by channel 12 80

549
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,120
of uh of israelis they prefer

550
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,320
normalization right

551
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,320
to to annexation so uh but uh

552
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,639
having said this this deal is covering

553
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,000
many areas it is covering uh diplomacy

554
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,200
security technology

555
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,400
health business at some say that it's uh

556
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,720
it's it's all about the weapons so what

557
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,039
do you

558
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,480
what do you what do you think almost how

559
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,320
this

560
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,159
prospective uh and nowadays

561
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,520
controversial issue

562
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,840
sale of f-35 uh to

563
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,559
uae uh would it really

564
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,158
jeopardize the uh or is it contrary to

565
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,360
the terms of uh

566
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:40,159
qme the uh quote qualitative

567
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,158
military edge or or not

568
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,879
yeah you raised an issue that came a

569
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,360
little bit later

570
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,159
after the announcement that the deal is

571
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,279
basically

572
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,880
uh on cancelling the annexation for

573
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:57,520
normalization

574
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:00,240
then there were leaks from uh

575
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,360
washington from abu dhabi maybe from

576
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,520
jerusalem

577
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,799
that there is another element to the

578
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,960
deal and this

579
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:12,000
is a huge supply of advanced

580
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,120
weapon to the uae

581
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,640
and then the story developed as

582
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,600
if prime minister netanyahu

583
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,880
is denying the fact that this is part of

584
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,559
the deal

585
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,600
but his friends over the ocean

586
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:34,080
gerald kushner and president trump

587
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:37,360
announcing that they will be more

588
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,799
liberal in is selling

589
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:44,879
advanced airplane and

590
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,200
maybe uavs and maybe cyber capabilities

591
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,039
to

592
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,799
to the uae this is something that the

593
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,080
public is not aware of

594
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:59,600
it was never published

595
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:02,720
depends who you want to to believe to

596
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,080
whether to trump or to netanyahu

597
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,000
i think future will future will tell

598
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,960
where is the truth

599
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,760
uh if it is part integral part of the

600
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,559
deal

601
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,559
and it is not happening i think we will

602
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,720
hear from the uae

603
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,760
that they are not happy that part of the

604
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,200
deal is not

605
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,760
materialized if it is part of the deal

606
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,799
and we will see the administration

607
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,320
submitting to congress

608
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,679
deals weapon deals then we know that

609
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,960
trump was right and bibi was wrong

610
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,960
let's wait for the future

611
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,000
thank you now there is a question from

612
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,399
from the public and the question is

613
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,200
directly following

614
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,399
your comments on this issue amos the

615
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,520
question is directed

616
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:56,158
to uh to optism

617
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,679
uh it's from tommy schneider steiner and

618
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,200
he's asking

619
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,720
whether uae and houma and the israeli

620
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,080
reservations

621
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,080
what do you make out of it

622
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:17,840
are you ready can you repeat the the

623
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,840
question please

624
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,559
yeah i can hear you but i i asked sylvia

625
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,240
to repeat the question i didn't hear it

626
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,840
well

627
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,240
she asked what is the opinion and what

628
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,279
the uae is thinking about this part of

629
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,480
the deal

630
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:48,960
the issue of supplying

631
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,960
advanced weapons to the ua

632
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,760
okay

633
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,440
i don't have the details

634
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:03,440
like you asked but i think if this is

635
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,440
part of the deal uh

636
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,879
it will be uh

637
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,799
yeah legitimate that uae also

638
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,080
living in a uh an environment

639
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,320
in a region full of threats and it wants

640
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,320
to

641
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,440
protect itself by the most advanced

642
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,760
uh weapons that at least i've been here

643
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,279
although i said this deals is not

644
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,399
against anybody

645
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,919
but we all know the threats from the

646
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,879
iranian from the iranian boxes

647
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,200
now from turkey from muslim brotherhood

648
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,880
so

649
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,760
getting this it is uh

650
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,520
i think also it's it's a war for uae

651
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,840
taking this initiative

652
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:56,480
and being uh the first

653
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,279
uh gulf countries

654
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,600
normalized with with israel but as i

655
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:06,000
said in the beginning

656
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:10,158
uh strategic

657
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,960
decision does not base on short term

658
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,760
it's not only about the ad this is a

659
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,039
strategic

660
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,440
shift that it's it's uh it's combining

661
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,320
from many many aspects so i

662
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,799
this is part of it but this is not all

663
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,120
uh

664
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,120
the ish

665
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,919
yes i'm sorry i just it was interrupted

666
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
the electricity

667
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,520
there was an electricity cut off so i

668
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,440
didn't get the beginning of

669
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,799
what you were saying but i presume that

670
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,880
you were talking about

671
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,000
or you were answering the the question

672
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,039
from uh

673
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,559
uh from the public so there was another

674
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,039
question from the public and it was

675
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,399
about

676
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,840
iran how much uh is iran

677
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:55,520
or yeah how much is iran a part of

678
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,279
uae israel israel agreement amos

679
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,440
and the question was directed to both of

680
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,440
you

681
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,279
the question is what iran can do about

682
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,640
the agreement

683
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,679
no how much how much of the agreement is

684
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,120
about iran

685
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,799
if i understood the question correctly

686
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,678
i think i answered it before i said that

687
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,080
beside the palestinians the middle east

688
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,399
is

689
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,678
full of challenges and full of threats

690
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:30,879
from the uae position uh

691
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:34,320
standpoint and from israeli temple

692
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,840
iran is a very negative uh

693
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,158
force in the middle east and

694
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,439
they are playing against the stability

695
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,039
in the middle east

696
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,000
and they have the desire to have a

697
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,279
germany in the middle

698
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,799
east and control the persian gulf

699
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:56,159
or the arab gulf and to have

700
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,720
influence in every arab

701
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,200
a country and capital which they have

702
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,200
now

703
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:07,440
in baghdad damascus beirut

704
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,480
and sana so

705
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,279
no doubt that iran is threatening the

706
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,039
uae

707
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,679
and threatening israel in their

708
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,879
aspiration for germany as well as

709
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,760
developing

710
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,320
the capability to have nuclear weapons

711
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,640
so

712
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,360
i will not be surprised even though

713
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,799
nobody will speak about it

714
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:34,240
explicitly that

715
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:38,158
the threat of iran and the fact

716
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,760
that the u.s is disengaging

717
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,080
and this is not only the trump

718
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,760
administration it has started with the

719
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,480
obama administration

720
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:51,600
so it's leave the struggle against iran

721
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,799
to the middle eastern forces countries

722
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,199
states and israel and uae

723
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,399
and saudi arabia and some other

724
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,000
countries

725
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:05,279
egypt are finding themselves

726
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,240
in a need to cooperate more to cope with

727
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,240
the iranian threat

728
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,799
what would you say about it do you have

729
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,239
anything to add

730
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,120
yeah yeah uh

731
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,640
well while this agreement is is not

732
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,479
specifically

733
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,519
uh directed against any party

734
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,960
it will certainly help weaken

735
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,840
uh choices of other regional powers like

736
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,679
iran

737
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,360
and turkey as well

738
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,559
so there is currently competition

739
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,959
between regional projects as uh such as

740
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,000
those

741
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,039
led by iran and turkey

742
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,120
as a the region is plagued by

743
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:56,240
whispers is witnessing the decline of

744
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,719
uh traditional arab major powers there

745
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,519
is

746
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,000
a near collapse of some arab state as

747
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,200
the

748
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,720
syria yemen iraq libya and lebanon so

749
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:11,119
both turkey and iran

750
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,480
mainly rely on on non-state actors to

751
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,399
expand their

752
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:19,599
uh influence in the region a fact that

753
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,960
aggregate aggravated the

754
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:27,359
the already chaotic situation there so

755
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:30,879
the d can serve as a preload

756
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,159
rebuild regional alliances sponsored by

757
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,879
the us

758
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,639
this will necessarily lead to a new

759
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,078
strategic

760
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,480
interactions that contribute to the

761
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:44,159
redistribution of

762
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,280
power in the middle east region so

763
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,639
it is expected that iran influence will

764
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,079
decline in the

765
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,359
liver while the us will continue

766
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,960
uh its efforts to to illustrate the iran

767
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,560
influence in iraq

768
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,079
as for turkey it has no strategic

769
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,440
choice to grow and thrive

770
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,400
for far away from the united states eu

771
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,680
and nato

772
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,280
if ankara chooses not to go back to its

773
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,118
traditional

774
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,320
bath aligned with with the west it will

775
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,960
certainly lose the and change

776
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,680
will take place in the redistribution of

777
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,560
power

778
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,040
in the region as a result of its decline

779
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,560
its

780
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,279
its regional losses and current turkish

781
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,240
governments

782
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,400
failure and development plans so it's

783
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,680
likely that

784
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,119
that the deal will help ease and later

785
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,720
resolve

786
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,359
chronic regional conflict it is the only

787
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,640
region

788
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,319
in the world that suffers from the

789
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,720
big number of raging conflicts

790
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,160
while president trump's administration

791
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,720
is committed

792
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,240
to achieving peace in middle east region

793
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,480
this deal

794
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,919
serves as the catalyst for this uh

795
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,400
for that purpose which which

796
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,400
has been

797
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,200
the vacuum created by the arab spring in

798
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,598
the region

799
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,919
uh found

800
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,920
iran

801
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,399
uh this distribute their power in the

802
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,280
region

803
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,720
yeah definitely definitely this is this

804
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,880
is having a this deal is having the

805
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,839
potential to change the regional

806
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,760
power balances now we have a two minutes

807
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,240
left two three minutes left

808
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,119
i'm a strong supporter and believer in

809
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,200
uh

810
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,960
people-to-people contacts in any kind of

811
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,520
normalization in any kind of peace

812
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,680
dealing

813
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,960
in any kind of dispute that it's uh or

814
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,118
not even dispute but in

815
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,359
any kind of normalization process uh

816
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,560
what would you like one par part of the

817
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,200
deal is tourism

818
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,200
how do you see the numbers of the

819
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,960
tourists from each country

820
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,399
uh it's at the end of the day it should

821
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,880
be about people we were talking about

822
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,960
security we were talking about strategy

823
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,920
um let's talk about people of both

824
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,960
countries a bit

825
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,079
and uh with that i i would like

826
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,680
you to conclude i think it's a nice

827
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:26,320
um and soft

828
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:29,440
and i'm also okay let me start

829
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:34,560
the israelis are

830
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,560
very much enjoying tourism in

831
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,040
in the middle east where they cannot go

832
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,920
to a neighboring country they will go to

833
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,960
the next

834
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,160
circuit greece cyprus

835
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,880
turkey unfortunately our relation with

836
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,160
turkey

837
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,160
were spoiled in the last decade and i

838
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,799
think

839
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,720
the uae is a wonderful place for the

840
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,680
israelis to go

841
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,799
we know that the hospitality there is

842
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,960
amazing

843
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,240
the infrastructure for tourists are

844
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,280
amazing

845
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,279
and if the

846
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,759
the normalization will go forward

847
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,000
in a in a positive way and if the

848
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,760
disease with disappear

849
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,680
or we find a vaccine soon i see

850
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:29,839
hundreds of thousands of israelis

851
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:33,520
putting a abu dhabi and dubai

852
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:36,560
and the uae on their tourism map

853
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,839
and vice versa because tel aviv is

854
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,920
interesting

855
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:44,320
and one of the most important sentence

856
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,320
in this

857
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,079
declaration in this deal that the three

858
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,440
leaders have done

859
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:56,880
two weeks ago was that

aksam mosque in jerusalem and kudz

861

will be open to every muslim this is

862
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,640
something that can bring a lot of

863
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,319
tourism

864
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,759
from uae to israel and once again

865
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:13,200
set the model for other arab countries

866
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:18,240
how peace can contribute so much

867
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,240

thank you thank you

869
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,560
i think always people to people this is

870
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,079
the question

871
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:33,520
for uh the official relation between

872
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,640
uh the two governments it's not only

873
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,920
tourism

874
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,920
there is economy uh there is

875
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,520
in the field of health and we already

876
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,839
signed uh

877
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,920
an agreement with israel regarding

878
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,400
developing the vaccination

879
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,359
and there is another thing also that

880
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,000
which i

881
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,960
think thank to to think time this is

882
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,800
this is also can help uh

883
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,839
in putting the infrastructure for this

884
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,599
relation discussion between the two

885
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,319
sides uh to materialize

886
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,680
this this relation to benefit from both

887
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,040
sides

888
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,399
it's not only tourism because this is

889
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,599
simple things but

890
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,640
if you want to make it deeper and real

891
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,440
normalization benefiting both sides it

892
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,560
should be

893
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,560
