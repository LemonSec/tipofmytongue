to tell us

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,920
one thing or brief series of things that

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,119
you want

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,280
everyone in the audience to do right now

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,360
or right after this panel

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
to make sure that they're keeping

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,640
themselves and their families

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,720
why don't you go first lisa

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,320
uh in that case why don't we go to neil

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,520
fox kim good evening everybody from

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,079
vienna

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,240
so what can we do to keep ourselves safe

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,960
to keep our family safe online

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
couple of simple things the number of

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,079
attacks

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,880
from criminals and even from states is

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,119
increasing

45
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,560
all the time we've seen it even

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,200
increasing significantly

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,119
during our lockdown due to covid so a

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,360
couple of simple things you can do

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,280
update your software whichever you use

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
on your phone and your computer

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
make sure it has the most up-to-date

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,439
operating system on it

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,000
do it right after this broadcast and

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,919
also

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
make sure that if you're using bluetooth

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,759
for example turn it off

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
if you're not actually connected to any

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,000
device reduce the attack

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
vector that the bad guys and the bad

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
girls will use

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,799
to try and get access to your device and

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
if something happens

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
if you feel like there is something

64
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
wrong with your device

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,000
get it checked run anti-malware

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,520
anti-viral software

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,319
and trust your own instinct if there's

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,440
something wrong get it checked out

69
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,079
got it uh lisa do you want to jump in

70
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
with your

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,720
recommendations to the audience sure the

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
recommendations would very much be in

73
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,599
line with what

74
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
neil already said no if a link looks

75
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,160
funny

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,040
it probably is uh even if it looks like

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,879
it's legitimate you know we all have

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,920
been trained to

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,760
spot sort of spear fishing

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,359
but we've not been trained to spot

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,879
really well social engineers

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,280
spearfishing that's

83
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,959
been designed to target you the

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,920
particular person

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,879
looking like it's coming from a business

86
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,920
acquaintance

87
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,239
a family member or anyone so

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,119
you know accept that you might have it

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,959
you call

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,760
and check if someone send you an email

91
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,560
even if it looks legitimate

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,239
update the software two-factor

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,959
authentication all of that already has

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,480
been

95
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,159
mentioned but i think most fundamentally

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,159
people need to accept that there's no

97
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,079
hundred percent

98
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,480
privacy in the digital world and there's

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,440
no hundred percent security

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,879
uh you can take steps to mitigate

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,239
probably the 90s

102
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,879
97 of the risks but

103
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,799
it's not binary the way it's in in the

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,280
physical world

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,760
there's still that 10 ali what would you

106
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,760
recommend

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,439
i think two areas first of all

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,280
we have a problem now with online

109
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,560
radicalization as you know there's

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,720
two billion people connected uh sorry to

111
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,040
to gaming for example and a lot of

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
terrorist groups and white

113
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,239
supremacizations are using the

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,439
gaming industry and the gaming culture

115
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,040
in order to recruit

116
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,478
people and find new in a new member

117
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
and provide them with alternative

118
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,599
narratives also

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,440
in the same time i think we have

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,520
other terrorist organizations and

121
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,600
violent groups also

122
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,280
still advocating their jihadi narrative

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,880
their racial narrative their economic

124
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,198
narrative whatever it is

125
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
second modern disinformation modern

126
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,680
disinformation including

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,680
the disinformation terrorism nexus now

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,440
it's being used by state

129
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,080
by states and by non-state actors

130
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,919
and they are effective they are keep to

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,000
destabilize society

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,440
based on these two things and especially

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,840
with a lot of people now

134
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,280
sitting online because of the pandemic i

135
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
think two things

136
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,599
please have conversations with your

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,800
children have conversation with your

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,840
children about

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,840
their online habits even

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,359
if they are doing something innocent

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,719
like playing a video game it is

142
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
important to know

143
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
if they are talking to strangers uh if

144
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,600
these applications

145
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,039
are suspicious uh what these strangers

146
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,400
are saying to them

147
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,320
and second before um we used to have if

148
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,039
you say some if you see something say

149
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,599
something

150
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,039
now i think we need a new slogan it's

151
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
think before you link

152
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,199
and this is how you deprive state actors

153
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,198
and non-state actors

154
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,720
from sharing and disseminating this

155
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,120
information on false narratives

156
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
well that leads us to secretary chertoff

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
so um

158
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,400
you were one of the people behind the

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,199
see something say something

160
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,679
movement um what would you tell people

161
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,280
well i agree with all the suggestions

162
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,240
that have been made so far

163
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,039
i think what i would add is this um

164
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,199
these days

165
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,360
your personal data can be weaponized and

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
used either against you or against your

167
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
friends

168
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,159
and associates i mean part of the way

169
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,479
people do the fishing

170
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
is they do research and they get enough

171
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,719
information about

172
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,479
what it is you are interested in what it

173
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,319
is you're doing to be able to create a

174
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,400
credible

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,560
false front that they can use then to

176
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,440
attack you or attack others

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,080
so i would say you know before you share

178
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,840
data

179
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,280
online or engage in transactions online

180
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,919
think about whether you really want to

181
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,039
do it what is the risk

182
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,039
how reliable is the enterprise you're

183
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,000
sharing with or the website you're going

184
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,960
to

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,919
and is there a way to get the same

186
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,318
result

187
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,159
but share less data or do it in a way in

188
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,319
which the data

189
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,800
ultimately doesn't get maintained and of

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,199
course i would then also say encryption

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
uh what are the principle ways we secure

192
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,240
ourselves these days to ensure

193
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,559
our data in motion and our data at rest

194
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,919
so

195
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,560
those tools that allow you to

196
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,000
communicate

197
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,039
with encrypted messaging uh are very

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,919
advantageous in the current environment

199
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,759
so turn on your password uh keeper

200
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,000
two-factor authentication

201
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,560
and um turn off your sharing of your

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,440
entire facebook network and your entire

203
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,280
linkedin network practical things that

204
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,960
bad actors search for information from

205
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,559
to target you correct

206
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,638
got it well i'd like to move into

207
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,720
how those bad actors are taking

208
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,000
advantage of the pandemic

209
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,440
right now um now ali mentioned

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,960
how terrorists use gaming to

211
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,520
groom um potential recruits

212
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,318
but uh neil you also have dealt with

213
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,000
this in

214
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,000
the trafficking realm what are you

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,599
seeing related to

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,440
especially the pandemic online

217
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,639
thanks kim and i agree entirely with

218
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,960
what uh ali lisa and michael said

219
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,240
what we've seen through our private

220
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,198
sector colleagues

221
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
and government partners since the start

222
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,680
of the pandemic

223
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,280
there has been without doubt a

224
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,479
significant growth

225
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,719
of online child sexual exploitation

226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,599
and i think one of the most disturbing

227
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,039
parts of that

228
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,000
is around 50 of child sexual abuse

229
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,280
material online

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,520
now is self-generated it's kids

231
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,120
sitting there with a smartphone with a

232
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,919
tablet with a laptop

233
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,320
taking sexualized pictures of themselves

234
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,399
uploading them sometimes unwittingly

235
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,080
and then sharing that material so that

236
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,320
creates the risk of them being

237
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,240
unfairly criminalized but also being

238
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,240
exploited through a long long period

239
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,040
yes correct yeah blackmail can be

240
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,479
happening there as well yeah

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,319
and you've seen a rise of that during

242
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,959
the pandemic because so many people are

243
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,200
at home

244
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,000
and and it's like it seems like parents

245
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,519
think it can't happen to their kids

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,839
i think that's a great point that there

247
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,160
is this i think when people are at home

248
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,240
we are psychologically more vulnerable

249
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,079
because we feel safer we're in our

250
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,440
domain that we feel comfortable in we

251
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,240
know where everything is we think we're

252
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,160
okay

253
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
and we take risks online that we

254
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,399
wouldn't do if we were sitting in the

255
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,880
workplace

256
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,240
or at school so we need to maintain that

257
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,279
level of suspicion that

258
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,880
level of awareness and i think as ali

259
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,160
was saying really instill that into our

260
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,279
kids from the earliest of ages

261
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,360
now lisa in estonia i know from

262
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,600
past leonard mary conferences you all

263
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,080
spend a lot of time

264
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,440
looking at nation state actors

265
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,080
specifically russia

266
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,240
but also others um what are you seeing

267
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,760
in terms of trends during this pandemic

268
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,200
who is taking advantage of this and how

269
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,279
so i i think

270
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
in terms of the pandemic nothing's new

271
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,839
and everything's new

272
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,079
at the same time so in many senses for

273
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,240
estonia and you know

274
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,360
governments and organizations in our

275
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,560
corner of the world it

276
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,279
has been business as usual uh

277
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,439
the transition to remote work whilst

278
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,240
almost overnight in a lot of places was

279
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,800
quite smooth

280
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,480
since the infrastructure is in place we

281
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,680
have a government tactic

282
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,519
security identity all of that well

283
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,959
actually in estonia i mean which is

284
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,000
known as estonia

285
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:29,279
for a reason right absolutely

286
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,440
however we also know now

287
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,480
looking at whichever of the past the

288
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
nation state

289
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,079
backed or at least politically motivated

290
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,560
cyber

291
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,880
attack campaigns it's clear that that

292
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,439
attacker is opportunistic

293
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,920
and reactive which means that of course

294
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,079
it

295
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,719
that sort of an attacker takes advantage

296
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,239
of any sort of

297
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,519
opportunity and in particular

298
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,160
the opportunistic attacker

299
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,000
tried to mix geopolitics and the

300
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,319
pandemic to delegitimize

301
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,160
the ways uh democratic

302
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,240
governments were dealing with a pandemic

303
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,360
and those news popped up all around the

304
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
world

305
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,360
and so can you give us an example of

306
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,360
that

307
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,000
i mean any case of mask diplomacy that

308
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,519
you ever saw masks landing with a flag

309
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,040
from countries that

310
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:28,320
weren't quite themselves reporting

311
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,599
events there's a fair amount of finger

312
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,560
pointing that happens

313
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,160
specifically early in the pandemic but

314
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,959
also it tied down

315
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,800
as everyone realized what the deep

316
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,880
global mess were in

317
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
but what continued and what continued

318
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,399
worldwide was

319
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,399
taking

320
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,000
uh teaching and impersonation so

321
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
north america

322
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:01,359
taking advantage of uh the pandemic

323
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,079
for spearfishing and impersonation

324
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,320
so particularly governments that had

325
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,399
some sort of aid packages

326
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,639
whether it was the us you know uh

327
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,839
payout to certain groups of citizens

328
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,360
whether it was

329
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:21,440
australian uh eight packages

330
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:24,560
there was a lot of spearfishing around

331
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,160
that in a very well designed very well

332
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,839
targeted

333
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,519
emails make you look like they're from

334
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,839
every government prepared to give you

335
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,839
money

336
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,120
and and thirdly i think for the intel

337
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,120
community

338
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
the methods tools and techniques were

339
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,240
new

340
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,839
uh availed rather but attack vectors

341
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
or the attack surface might have been

342
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,920
new since no one

343
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,638
really was preparing for a wide scale

344
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,599
global attempt of you know

345
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,040
trying to steal ip when it comes to

346
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,360
medical research

347
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,560
vaccine development things like that and

348
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,320
and it makes so much sense that

349
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
in the global pandemic where there's a

350
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,720
single focusing

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,839
item on the agenda and there's a race to

352
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,120
develop

353
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,959
solutions that you know spies are going

354
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,760
to spy

355
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,599
so you're talking about the reports um

356
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,560
by us officials and others that

357
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,040
russia and other actors have tried to

358
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,239
steal

359
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,240
some of the intellectual property around

360
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,760
vaccine development to fight covet

361
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
things like that

362
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,240
exactly and russia and china are the two

363
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,360
that have been named

364
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,360
specifically it's

365
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,279
no it's clear that if it wasn't a

366
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,959
vaccine in a pandemic

367
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,880
it would be designs in the defense

368
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
industry so in a way it's

369
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,240
spies are going to spy but then there's

370
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,399
an extra added layer of this

371
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,360
acute and pressing issue of a global

372
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,440
pandemic

373
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,680
that's focusing it into this particular

374
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,839
area

375
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,839
now

376
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:13,120
medical technology is notoriously non

377
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,160
secure it's not safe it has the longest

378
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,839
patch

379
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,240
cycles in the world of of any industry

380
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,480
that

381
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,480
that i'm familiar with in fact there's

382
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
plenty of medical technology including

383
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,320
life-saving

384
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,639
saving devices that have well-known and

385
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,120
quite well researched vulnerabilities

386
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,160
where the cv number starts with one nine

387
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,199
meaning they were

388
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,279
first noticed and registered in

389
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,959
in a year that started with one line in

390
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,360
the previous century

391
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,040
so one of the silver linings of this i

392
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,120
guess is that

393
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,240
there wasn't a lot of attacks against

394
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,399
life-saving saving medical technology

395
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:55,199
which is actually often insecure

396
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,320
and often full of vulnerabilities since

397
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
there's a race to

398
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,399
obviously you go out and save lives

399
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,839
rather than

400
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:07,519
secure technology itself

401
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,959
so i was going to turn to uh

402
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,680
mike chertoff to ask you you must have

403
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,279
been watching the early attempts by

404
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,560
china and others

405
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,320
to steal intellectual property to start

406
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,000
spreading disinformation those were the

407
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,079
early years of china's

408
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,920
ai artificial intelligence campaign

409
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,079
what sort of evolution have you seen

410
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,040
well i think we've seen a number of

411
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,199
things obviously chinese espionage

412
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,800
has been going on for for quite some

413
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,880
time and not just

414
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,359
traditional national security espionage

415
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,759
but commercial espionage

416
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,560
to help their state-supported

417
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,440
enterprises and that that continues

418
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,319
um now what we've seen more recently is

419
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,959
the chinese have identified

420
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,199
artificial intelligence as an area they

421
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,560
want to have global primacy in

422
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,880
and the way you build that is you

423
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,920
combine developing algorithms

424
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,560
with huge amounts of data and we've seen

425
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,160
some massive data thefts

426
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,920
in my view i think many of these

427
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,519
actually are

428
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,479
generated by china we had the theft of

429
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,199
millions of files on background checks

430
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,360
from the u.s

431
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,040
office of personnel management we've

432
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,680
seen yahoo accounts

433
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,719
and other accounts being stolen at a

434
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,920
scale that would be

435
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,120
useless for human beings to review

436
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,959
but are exactly the kind of grist for

437
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,959
building artificial intelligence so i

438
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,518
think there is a concern

439
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,599
if the chinese are building a very

440
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,320
comprehensive profile

441
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,839
of all americans and maybe citizens of a

442
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,360
lot of other countries

443
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,560
and this can be used as a way of social

444
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,519
engineering

445
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,079
uh it can be used as a way of promoting

446
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,399
uh

447
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,040
you know impersonation but it can also

448
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,560
be used to target political messaging

449
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,719
and although the russians have been the

450
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,720
principal actors in the disinformation

451
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,520
field particularly as it

452
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,799
applies to trying to affect elections i

453
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,639
think we're going to see the chinese

454
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,400
doing more of this

455
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,959
particularly to elevate their own brand

456
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,319
globally at the expense of the way

457
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,039
people are looking at the western

458
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,039
democracies

459
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,639
so uh ali you have been

460
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:32,000
the subject of a disinformation attack

461
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,039
can you tell us what happened to you and

462
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,039
how did you fight back

463
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,559
um well thanks um

464
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,600
early i think early may i was briefed by

465
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,280
entities in the intelligence community

466
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,678
here in the united states

467
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,039
about credible threats uh from a

468
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,320
terrorist organization

469
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,280
from al-qaeda um and a few short

470
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,320
weeks after that i found myself on the

471
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,879
receiving end of

472
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
sophisticated disinformation campaign

473
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,600
and

474
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,639
it was targeting my career when i was in

475
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,678
the fbi

476
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,799
targeting my character and uh

477
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,080
worst still the disinformation campaign

478
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,240
was utilizing

479
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,240
a lot of the false narratives and a lot

480
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,960
of the dangerous imagery

481
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,640
that was communicated to me by by the

482
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,280
government by the intelligence community

483
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,720
about the threat itself

484
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,639
so we started to do our own

485
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,280
investigation but at the same time

486
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,520
the fbi and others in the us government

487
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,600
did their own investigation as well

488
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,200
and we found out that the social media

489
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,799
campaign against me have

490
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,799
um horrific

491
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,559
similarities if you want to call it with

492
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,760
the campaign that targeted jamal

493
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,960
khashoggi

494
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,480
uh it included the same people the same

495
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,919
accounts

496
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,679
you know that survived twitter removing

497
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,320
accounts every now and then

498
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,520
and we were able to connect uh the

499
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,360
campaign itself

500
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,280
to uh accounts linked to saudi arabia

501
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,799
and the saudi government

502
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,840
um so jamal khashoggi was the dissident

503
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,360
um saudi dissident turned opinion writer

504
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,120
for the washington post

505
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,080
who was killed inside the saudi

506
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,959
consulate in turkey

507
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,639
right so giving the timing of the threat

508
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
information that i was received from the

509
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,160
government

510
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,799
and the highly coordinated campaign it

511
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,240
was

512
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,639
really kind of uh you know

513
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,320
impossible or even irresponsible not to

514
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,280
consider

515
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,080
that the possibility that the campaign

516
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,760
the social media

517
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,080
campaign and the threat might be

518
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,919
connected to each other and this is what

519
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,840
the u.s government continued to

520
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,640
investigate and i think that they found

521
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,439
a lot of

522
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,440
really good good results throughout

523
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,160
their investigation so far

524
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,200
um and it won't be the same where we see

525
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,280
a state actor

526
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,640
and non-state actors directly or

527
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,039
indirectly

528
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,760
trying to you know either incite each

529
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,120
other or

530
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,158
or or promote a narrative against

531
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,799
an individual in this case it is

532
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,919
it is some you know it's me so one of

533
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,320
the things that we

534
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,120
notice in uh the campaign that the

535
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,039
saudis are using it's basically copied

536
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,799
from the russian information campaign

537
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,000
first of all you have a lot of false

538
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,480
information somebody

539
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,679
put false allegation out there this is

540
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,600
kind of the honey that

541
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,320
attract the electronic bees or the

542
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,280
electronic flies to come over

543
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,120
and try to create to echo these

544
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,960
narratives and then

545
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,039
you have people who make short videos

546
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
about them or memes about them and put

547
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,158
them

548
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,158
out and then you will try to take it to

549
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,679
the mainstream by having verified a

550
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,080
twitter account

551
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,760
tweeting these uh import this

552
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,840
misinformation

553
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,120
and this information and when these are

554
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,879
tweeted then

555
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,559
you will have legitimate media

556
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,400
organizations in this case

557
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,280
all of it were in the arab world because

558
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,159
uh the lie that the campaign was so

559
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,840
obviously fill the flag that it won't

560
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,280
fly in america for anybody to write

561
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,280
about it or in the english-speaking

562
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,600
world to write about it

563
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,879
um they put it in their home because um

564
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,959
journalists in the west

565
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,000
would have to source that information

566
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,120
without just picking

567
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
up a social media post well absolutely

568
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,959
like for example when they say that i

569
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,799
was involved in torturing every arab in

570
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,039
american jails i was involved

571
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,320
in uh in in you know a conspiracy by the

572
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,080
obama administration

573
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,678
and by the trump administration to

574
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,360
destroy the muslim world

575
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,200
that all the problems that's happening

576
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,240
in libya or in somalia

577
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,760
or in syria was going through me and

578
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,480
there are founders in the middle east do

579
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,640
you know you were that powerful ally

580
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,320
i didn't i didn't but uh i was telling

581
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,320
my wife hey you better listen to me look

582
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,399
how powerful i am on social media if she

583
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:59,840
did not care but you know

584
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,840
yeah so so before we move on

585
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,600
officials have yet confirmed to you who

586
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,200
they if they think it's definitely a

587
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,439
nation-state actor as opposed to

588
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,039
al-qaeda

589
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,200
i don't want to say what the united

590
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,679
states government is telling me about

591
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
this

592
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,200
the disinformation campaign and the

593
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
investigation on the disinformation

594
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,520
campaign

595
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
but we know that there is two different

596
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,520
investigations happening at the same

597
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,280
time the disinformation investigation

598
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,200
and the foreign influence investigation

599
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,039
and the terrorism investigation which is

600
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,640
a threat from al-qaeda

601
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:33,360
and how these two meet each other

602
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,640
and i'm not i'm not ready to speak about

603
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,360
it at this point it's an ongoing

604
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,360
investigation

605
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,240
so i just wanted to let the audience

606
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,400
know that we're going to shortly

607
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,960
take questions so if you could please uh

608
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,760
start sharing questions to the chat

609
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,159
um but i i wanted to pivot to neil and

610
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,440
ask

611
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:57,679
how this disinformation is um

612
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,960
being used by criminal networks or

613
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,000
terrorist networks

614
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,000
uh and how that's making your job harder

615
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,720
it's a great question kim i wish there

616
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,360
was an easy answer to it i think

617
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,679
the sheer scale that we've seen of

618
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,039
misinformation and disinformation

619
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,960
is beyond what anyone expected so if we

620
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,960
look there is a broad campaign within

621
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,280
the u.n called verified

622
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,880
which is trying to get the public to

623
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,520
really think about

624
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,240
the sourcing chain of what they read

625
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,559
online

626
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,559
do you believe straight away what you

627
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,200
read can you independently

628
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,158
verify the origin of what you're reading

629
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,799
on social media

630
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,480
or on the news or anywhere else and i

631
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,320
think as ali was saying sometimes even

632
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,600
when this is generated from verified

633
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,439
accounts so on

634
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,719
twitter or facebook and you've got that

635
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,559
blue tick beside you

636
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,720
it doesn't necessarily mean that the

637
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,520
information that uh one's reading is

638
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,600
true

639
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,679
so a lot of what we're doing in the um

640
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,320
now is actually focusing on kids

641
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,880
and teenagers at school and those going

642
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,439
in

643
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,000
to college and university and focusing

644
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,360
very much

645
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,799
on giving them better skills to

646
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,760
their reading and making critical

647
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,520
thinking decisions about how they react

648
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,879
and i think sometimes we think well this

649
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,840
is primarily a

650
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,600
western problem or a economically

651
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,039
developed problem but it hits

652
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,158
every country where you have 3g 4g 4g

653
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,080
connection

654
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,360
and we need to make sure that our kids

655
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,760
from the earliest ages

656
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,360
and our teachers and educators

657
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,520
understand how to better

658
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,360
help our kids and our teenagers to get

659
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,480
their way through lives and help to make

660
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,240
those decisions

661
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,240
about what their reading is true and how

662
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,559
not to share misinformation

663
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,520
unintentionally and to share

664
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,840
disinformation

665
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,320
intentionally because the impact is is

666
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
extreme

667
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,520
it sounds almost like something that

668
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,639
needs to be part of an education

669
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,039
curriculum

670
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,760
from the earliest age you know as part

671
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,600
of

672
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,039
the stem education in the u.s or

673
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,279
something like that

674
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,400
a couple of days ago my staff in

675
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,760
honduras

676
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,840
had 5000 teachers online and explaining

677
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,879
cyber security as part of a five-week

678
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,799
training course

679
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,919
so we've got around 20 of the teachers

680
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,799
in that country

681
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,679
skilled up on what these risks are but

682
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,960
that's one country out of 193 so we need

683
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,480
to make this routine

684
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,120
has to be part of the education

685
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,760
curriculum and it has to be a normal

686
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,879
life skill that our kids have as they go

687
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,200
through their life cycle

688
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,120
if if we're only addressing this when

689
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,240
they're in high school or university

690
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,239
we are way too late

691
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,559
now i'd like to turn to a live question

692
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,120
from our global audience um could we get

693
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,039
your question

694
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,120
hi my name is hans schindler i'm the

695
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,879
senior director of the counter extremism

696
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,639
project one of the partner organizations

697
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,120
of klopsec and i wanted to go

698
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,880
back to the issue of the operational use

699
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,799
of social media and internet service by

700
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,520
terrorist organizations it's been

701
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,639
quite a few years clearly that these

702
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,400
services have become an

703
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,760
integral part of any terrorist

704
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,279
organization whether it's extreme

705
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,000
right-wing or islamist

706
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,919
and we have not seen the compliance of

707
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,799
companies really significantly making

708
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,840
attending

709
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,080
into this misuse now outside monitoring

710
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,240
by internet referral unit police units

711
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,039
users is really important but it cannot

712
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,039
really

713
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,679
be the solution given the vast amount of

714
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,520
data that is uploaded

715
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,279
so the companies have to be part of the

716
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,918
solution what would

717
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,159
a sensible government regulation look

718
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,240
like that would incentivize

719
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:38,559
the strengthening of compliance systems

720
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:42,880
especially at global platforms

721
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:46,799
so who would like to dig into that one

722
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,720
before the gentleman addressed the what

723
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,279
before the gentleman interested what i

724
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,320
think it's important to recognize that

725
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,600
the

726
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,600
compliance mechanism and the policy

727
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,799
itself that's addressing the global

728
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,520
platforms

729
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,918
cannot be a national one but rather it's

730
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,279
one

731
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,520
where like-minded nations be it

732
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,200
through the european union that's making

733
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,639
great strides

734
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,440
with the digital services act with uh

735
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,080
you know by now we understand what the

736
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,799
infamous

737
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,559
gdpr actually does the network

738
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,559
information security directive

739
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,720
or be through other international

740
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,279
alliances

741
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,039
is where we can really create norms and

742
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,960
be an equal partner

743
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:36,320
to these platforms because frankly

744
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,200
any national market with the exception

745
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,080
of perhaps

746
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,960
a few of the largest countries in the

747
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,158
world

748
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,559
is simply too small for these tech

749
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,480
giants this global tech chance to take

750
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,480
their national policies incredibly

751
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,320
seriously

752
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,640
yeah so as long as there are no rules

753
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,918
the bad actors around the world can take

754
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,559
advantage of that

755
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,000
but it seems i've been to a lot of

756
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,720
discussions where

757
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,559
international standards are talked about

758
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,320
but nobody seems to want to take the

759
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,000
first leap so perhaps if

760
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,120
you want to do business with the eu

761
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,720
you've got to meet their standards

762
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,799
that could help

763
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,799
i think couple of things you know we can

764
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,039
do on these on these issues

765
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,480
countries uh in their own national

766
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,240
community strategy

767
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,720
they should emphasize that this

768
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,760
information is a significant threat

769
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,480
uh to them and and then all agencies

770
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,080
need to

771
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,000
start to work uh in accordance with

772
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,360
the national security strategy for

773
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,159
example also

774
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,000
government should criminalize the use of

775
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,640
malicious deep

776
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,840
there is no reason for it not to be

777
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,640
criminalized and

778
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,760
and dealt with accordingly in the united

779
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,919
states i think

780
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,200
uh we should also consider aggressively

781
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,120
using sanctions

782
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,360
against foreign-based individuals and

783
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,719
entities that are waging malicious

784
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,240
disinformation campaigns

785
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,159
against our citizens against our

786
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,679
governments against our communities

787
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,840
and against um against our people

788
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,000
congress should consider adopting

789
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,480
sanction disinformation act and i know

790
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,840
that

791
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,840
some people in congress are talking

792
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,799
about something like this that aimed

793
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,720
to provide the united uh the the state

794
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,399
department and the treasury department

795
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,880
with all the legal authorities

796
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,158
to sanction individuals and to sanction

797
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,880
organizations

798
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,039
uh that are engaged in malicious

799
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,840
disinformation and misinformation

800
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,399
um activities so there's a lot of and

801
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,959
seems

802
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,320
to take a disinformation 911 of some

803
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,240
sorts to bring

804
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,520
people together but i do want to pivot

805
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,880
back to the question of

806
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:48,158
how terrorists are taking advantage um

807
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,000
neil did you have thoughts on that

808
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,360
i think broadly kim and listening to

809
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,120
what ellie said as well there are

810
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,719
discussions throughout the u.n and a

811
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,199
number of processes

812
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,559
in the general assembly that look at

813
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,880
what state-based

814
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,039
cyber norms may be but they are

815
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,600
exceptionally difficult there is so much

816
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,279
uh geopolitical split on that that

817
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,559
finding areas of consensus are really

818
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,320
quite challenging

819
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,678
um in terms of the terrorism space and

820
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,080
the broader crime space

821
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,600
um back to what we've already had the

822
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,439
sheer availability

823
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,120
of information out there that people

824
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,240
willingly upload

825
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,559
makes their job their role as criminals

826
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,480
or terrorists exceptionally easy to do

827
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,320
so it comes back again to how much data

828
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,760
we put out there how do we manage those

829
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,399
risks ourselves and i don't think we're

830
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,720
having

831
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,399
a great enough discussion on that

832
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,840
initial point of prevention

833
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,520
that we're trying to put a sticking

834
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,879
plaster on a broken leg

835
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,559
and actually considering why are we

836
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,720
putting so much data out there

837
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,918
there is also a great role on internet

838
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,480
service providers

839
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,600
uh globally and uh and communication

840
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,600
service providers

841
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,360
to be more involved in this and we are

842
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,000
through the the secretary general of the

843
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,240
un

844
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,520
his digital cooperation roadmap we are

845
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,440
trying to do that

846
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,120
but i wish there was an easy solution to

847
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,399
it i'm not sure there is yet i'm really

848
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,080
keen to hear the views of

849
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,719
of others and uh and those who are

850
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,279
listening to this as well

851
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,120
secretary chairtop it seems you know you

852
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,679
guys started the fight early on to try

853
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,799
to

854
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,320
find um the how terrorists were using

855
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,399
the internet

856
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,559
but it does seem from the outside

857
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,279
looking in that every time

858
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,158
you get facebook or twitter or you know

859
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,760
name the app

860
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,200
to police their network better

861
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,679
that the terrorists just migrate to

862
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,440
somewhere else

863
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,960
well that's true there's a whole dark

864
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,919
net that

865
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,880
creates platforms uh that people can use

866
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,320
to

867
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,720
uh you know plan and plot and instruct

868
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,879
people how to carry out terrorist acts

869
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,240
i i would say this though i would say

870
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,679
one of the

871
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,519
things that we ought to look at with the

872
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,200
social media platforms is the

873
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,399
use of algorithms that tend to drive

874
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,880
people deeper into uh

875
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,399
radicalization what what happens in many

876
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,679
cases

877
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,799
is people will go to a site or they may

878
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,720
search

879
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,399
looking for you know perfectly

880
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,840
reasonable answer to a question of

881
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,959
curiosity

882
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,918
about let's say you know islamic

883
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,240
religion or some political movement

884
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,320
but the algorithms which are designed

885
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,279
for commercial purposes

886
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,519
to increase the degree of engagement and

887
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,840
intensity by users

888
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,279
will then start to recommend

889
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,039
increasingly

890
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,760
extreme versions of the subject matter

891
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,480
that the person was looking at and for

892
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,200
some people that winds up luring them

893
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,760
into a level of engagement and

894
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,120
intensification

895
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,879
with extremist ideologies

896
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,719
and the value of these algorithms is

897
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,039
frankly purely commercial

898
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,919
it's designed to make you buy stuff so

899
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,000
that may be an

900
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,519
area that we need to work on regulating

901
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,519
uh particularly when it deals with

902
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,120
subject matter that is political i know

903
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,080
some of the platforms are talking about

904
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,760
that

905
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,678
on the other hand i would say this so

906
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,879
the commercial algorithms don't end up

907
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,159
helping um a someone who's on the fence

908
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,559
to find radicalization

909
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,799
well what it does is it kind of it

910
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,879
begins to feed them

911
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,559
you know potential opportunities to look

912
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,159
at things that are more and more radical

913
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,480
because the algorithm

914
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,760
is trying to get more engagement and

915
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,399
more intense

916
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,760
activity online the the reason the

917
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,600
algorithm is designed

918
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,039
is for commercial purposes but it winds

919
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,719
up being used for nefarious purposes

920
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,399
um the other thing i would say is i've

921
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,919
got to be a little careful

922
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,639
on regulating disinformation because

923
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,919
one person's disinformation is another

924
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,000
person's free speech

925
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,279
and given that we now have some people

926
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,080
in government

927
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,279
labeling anything critical as quote fake

928
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,039
news

929
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,120
giving the government the ability to

930
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,720
regulate quote fake news

931
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,639
could be something that would be

932
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,640
celebrated in beijing

933
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,039
but not necessarily good for liberal

934
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,200
democracies

935
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,560
and we're seeing that right now with the

936
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,520
thai group that's critical

937
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,239
of the monarchy that facebook has uh now

938
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,399
kicked off

939
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,520
of facebook at least the original group

940
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,879
has been um a question from the audience

941
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,879
for ali from

942
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,118
when talking about online jihadi

943
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,960
radicalization

944
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,159
there is usually also an added factor

945
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,000
from the physical world

946
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,839
the jihadi radicalization is seldom

947
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
totally an online process

948
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,119
so my question to ali but also for

949
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,159
anyone else

950
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,440
is this the same with the far-right

951
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,440
radicalization

952
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,359
in the case of aspiring jihadis the

953
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,879
added factor from the physical world is

954
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,879
usually an already radicalized

955
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,399
individual um

956
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,319
with the far right is that also how it

957
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,159
works

958
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,920
yeah absolutely we see that with the far

959
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,760
right as well

960
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,079
there is always a bridge from the

961
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,160
cybersphere to the physical sphere they

962
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,440
do events they go and celebrate hitler's

963
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,879
birthday from all

964
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,839
all across the the the western world

965
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,400
frankly

966
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,640
uh now many of these uh white

967
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,000
supremacist extremists from the united

968
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,480
states from canada from

969
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
australia from new zealand from every

970
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,400
european countries and grow back

971
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,839
volkswagen did a lot of research also on

972
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,079
these elements they go

973
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,359
to ukraine and they fight in ukraine so

974
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,280
ukraine is

975
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,078
the white supremacist version of what

976
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,599
afghanistan used to be for the jihadis

977
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,079
in in in the 90s so yes definitely there

978
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,960
is

979
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,520
there is a bridge and exactly like the

980
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,200
question

981
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,480
mentioned with the jihadis and the

982
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,240
physical world also we have uh verified

983
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,119
accounts and we have real

984
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,879
individuals who basically promote uh

985
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,640
these narratives and the conspiracy

986
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,359
theories that's happening

987
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,200
in the real world and they piggyback on

988
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,640
other conspiracy theories in order to

989
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,240
promote their narrative

990
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,920
so we're having that that narrative

991
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,598
as i mentioned in the case against me

992
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,720
with uh with the threat and the

993
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,599
disinformation

994
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,160
going from the cyber sphere to the

995
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,800
physical

996
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,200
sphere through media entities and

997
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,040
through

998
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,000
real individuals that are bringing it to

999
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,759
life uh yeah absolutely there's always

1000
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,119
there's always that bridge for any

1001
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,480
disinformation uh

1002
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,839
operation or any uh recruitment um

1003
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,800
to be to be realistic and to be uh to be

1004
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,799
effect effective

1005
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,599
neil or lisa did you have anything to

1006
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,599
add to that

1007
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,200
so we're going to the next question um

1008
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,119
this one is from carl cox how can

1009
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,680
artificial intelligence and machine

1010
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,400
learning

1011
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,399
actually help us to combat cyber attacks

1012
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,960
who can take a stab at that

1013
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,319
so the fundamental problem with machine

1014
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,200
learning and

1015
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,760
ai in any setting is that it's only as

1016
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,839
good as

1017
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,839
its training data

1018
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,040
so what does that mean

1019
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,359
if what goes into your

1020
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,839
machine learning system or into into

1021
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,119
your system that uses ai in a security

1022
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,240
setting

1023
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,680
if that the outcome can never be better

1024
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,040
than the quality of the

1025
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:37,040
input the training data so

1026
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,880
if what goes in includes

1027
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:45,200
it has human error in it you know we

1028
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,200
there's a lot of talk about using

1029
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,160
these sorts of systems in responding to

1030
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,320
cyber attacks

1031
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,160
and i'm cautious and i'm cautious

1032
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,599
because

1033
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:01,598
these systems are

1034
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,599
no they can only be trained on

1035
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,520
events of the past which means the

1036
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,839
response can't be any better than the

1037
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,880
human response of the past

1038
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:14,400
but there are a few things where i think

1039
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,320
uh there there's space for ai

1040
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,400
or machine learning and security the

1041
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,920
first of them is triage

1042
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,119
you know prioritizing events for

1043
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,839
before a human reviews them

1044
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,320
any complex system can easily have tens

1045
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,520
of thousands of vulnerabilities and can

1046
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,880
see now thousands of actions against

1047
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,720
them in a month

1048
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,760
most of them are just people passing by

1049
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,959
a global

1050
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,240
global sort of events

1051
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,800
but and it's really hard for a human

1052
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,680
to review these you know sometimes

1053
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,280
thousands sometimes

1054
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,799
tens of thousands of events and

1055
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,200
vulnerabilities

1056
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,160
and based on past human prioritization

1057
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,960
machines can speed up the triage process

1058
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,640
effect

1059
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,119
where i'm very hopeful and secondly

1060
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,078
in a similar way i'm very hopeful for

1061
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:15,839
that to happen in the information space

1062
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,839
because no in in nato

1063
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,680
languages and it's hard to

1064
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,320
rely on human researchers

1065
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,440
to sort of go through what might

1066
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,520
possibly

1067
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,720
be illegitimate external meddling

1068
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,640
in our information space

1069
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,078
and then compare it across national

1070
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,960
boundaries to see if it's a wider sort

1071
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,000
of campaign

1072
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,680
that will take even with very dedicated

1073
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,680
researchers

1074
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,720
months most likely years and by that

1075
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,399
time we moved on

1076
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,078
from being able to respond to a

1077
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,240
real-time event

1078
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:02,480
so sort of machine learning combined

1079
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:05,200
with uh no trend

1080
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,280
translation automatic translation i'm

1081
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,839
really hopeful will help us

1082
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,240
spot this sort of information operations

1083
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,240
that

1084
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,240
are global but because they happen

1085
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,040
across languages and cultures we don't

1086
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,479
get your spot

1087
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,480
until later otherwise

1088
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,520
so um in the three or minute three

1089
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,599
minutes or so that we have left i

1090
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,200
i'd like to ask you all for uh just a

1091
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,800
really quick

1092
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,839
um thought about again bringing it back

1093
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,640
to the audience

1094
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,480
everyone listening and making them a

1095
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,240
more of a united front

1096
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,599
in confronting uh cyber bad actors

1097
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,560
uh what is the one thing that each of

1098
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,200
you knows

1099
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,599
like friends of yours family members do

1100
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,078
that

1101
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,560
that drives you crazy that they should

1102
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,160
stop right now

1103
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:02,480
uh dale do you want to start yeah

1104
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,160
oh sorry um secure it it's a little

1105
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,760
less of an issue right now because we're

1106
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,640
all on lockdown

1107
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,560
but the two things that used to really

1108
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,359
bug me and still do are one

1109
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,000
people who use publicly available

1110
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,680
non-password protected wi-fi

1111
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to send sensitive information

1112
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,440
and second when someone sends you an

1113
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,040
encrypted

1114
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:31,280
document by email and then sends you the

1115
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,800
um encryption key in the next email

1116
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,480
that doesn't achieve anything from a

1117
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,119
security standpoint

1118
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,520
if you want to send the decryption key

1119
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:44,000
send it using a different medium

1120
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:47,599
or better yet use the telephone

1121
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
i i have um the bank and a few of

1122
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,160
different

1123
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,079
other offices that send me that uh

1124
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,799
sequence on a regular basis so thank you

1125
00:41:52,079 --> 00:42:02,400
for that

1126
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:06,480
um ali how about you

1127
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,640
well why don't we uh i'm not hearing ali

1128
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,000
can you hear me now there you are can

1129
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,640
you hear me

1130
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,119
yes okay so the secretary mentioned uh

1131
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,078
this

1132
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,280
uh what he did and it's it's really

1133
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,839
great and also

1134
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,800
what we heard at the beginning of the of

1135
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,480
the form

1136
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,920
uh some of the recommendations regarding

1137
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,079
passwords and all these things but one

1138
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,880
thing that really drives me crazy is

1139
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,319
and i have it in my family friends a lot

1140
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,400
of people who if

1141
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,640
if they read it on facebook that it has

1142
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,480
to be true and they uh

1143
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,720
you know they they repeat all false

1144
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,920
narratives and this is regarding

1145
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,480
uh whatever it's covet with 5g

1146
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,599
with the anti-vaxxer movement you go

1147
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,680
down the list of

1148
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,960
everything that has been now reported

1149
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,440
and everything that

1150
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,839
all these uh radical groups white

1151
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,160
supremacists or jihadis they repeat and

1152
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,078
they

1153
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,359
they amplify and it's all based on false

1154
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,000
information

1155
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,520
again uh think before you link um this

1156
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,200
is extremely important

1157
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,640
just because i think it does not mean

1158
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,799
yeah got it and uh neil

1159
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,680
and lisa in the 20 seconds you each have

1160
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,839
left uh neil go

1161
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,680
so really summing up what the others

1162
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,680
have said think before you do

1163
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,160
something online and just because

1164
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,200
someone is expecting you or trying to

1165
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,279
pressure you

1166
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,720
to do something online to click a link

1167
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,480
to download a document

1168
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,240
doesn't mean you have to you're in

1169
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,760
control

1170
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,160
got it and lisa so many of my

1171
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,680
so many of my pet peeves have been

1172
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,680
mentioned already

1173
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,680
here's another one from people spending

1174
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,040
a lot of time online whilst being

1175
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,279
at home in lockdown give your sensitive

1176
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,359
data that makes you vulnerable for free

1177
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,400
thinking it's entertainment you know

1178
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,400
these games where

1179
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,160
name your favorite childhood pet than

1180
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,240
the street you grew up on

1181
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,000
well those are actually password hint

1182
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,078
questions you've answered somewhere

1183
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,520
why do you give it away for free and

1184
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,839
similarly posting

1185
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,640
your childhood and current picture next

1186
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,839
to each other

1187
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,319
is just giving a free

1188
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:13,359
facial recognition training data

1189
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,599
specifically for aging algorithms for ai

1190
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,200
why do you do that to yourself you could

1191
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,960
just as well put the bullseye on your

1192
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,879
back

1193
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,640

behind it

1250

is to promote effective responses to

1251
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,118
terrorism financing

1252
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,359
in the western balkans by drawing on

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,240
globesec bratislava forum is the

1274
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,839
platform to tackle disruption

1275
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,399
and discuss solutions for better

1276
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,240
tomorrows

1277
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,520
basic theme of disruption is crucial

1278
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,118
because to me

1279
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,880
the issue is not whether it's climate

1280
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,160
change or whether it's the chinese or

1281
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,720
the russians or whatever

1282
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,598
it's actually the concatenation the mix

1283
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,839
of them all

1284
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,839
and that's
