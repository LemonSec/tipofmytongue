1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,480
one day a stranger came with an offer i

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
will give you blacksmith

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,639
a bag full of gold coins for a special

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,120
task

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,160
on one condition never talk to anyone

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,200
about it

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,880
the blacksmith agreed a stranger gave

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,520
him a huge slab of gold

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,038
and asked him to make a horseshoe with

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,359
that goat

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,359
then they went into high mountains and

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,359
deep into a cave

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,679
the blacksmith could not believe his

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,280
eyes there was an army of knights

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,079
sleeping in full armor who are they

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,520
the stranger replied those warriors had

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,920
been in deep sleep

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,879
for hundreds of years they will only

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
wake up

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,079
if it is time to fight a real great

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
battle

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,360
for the country the stranger told the

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,920
blacksmith to change the horseshoe

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
of one of the horses when the job was

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,680
done

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,440
he paid what was promised the blacksmith

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,920
went back to his shop

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,960
and of course he was not able to keep

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
his word

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,840
he told his wife and friends and then

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,880
his bag full of gold coins

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,080
turned into sand the blacksmith tried to

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,000
return to that cave

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,158
but he was never able to find it again

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,840
but simple and banal story has some

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,840
morals that i quite

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,560
that i find quite relevant for the

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,439
transatlantic alliance today

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
first military preparedness is not a

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,880
luxury

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,280
we can live without we need to be ready

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,560
for

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,720
any eventuality whether we talk about

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,119
military expenditure in european

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,840
countries or american soldiers

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,880
stationed in europe we need every single

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
euro cent

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,798
and every single pair of military boots

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,720
on the ground

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,000
even if the prospect of open military

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,880
conflict is distant

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
second in relations across the pond we

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,798
need to keep our

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
promises hold on to the goodwill

55
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,280
established between

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,719
allies after 1945 trade

57
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,320
non-proliferation regulation of a

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,878
digital sphere

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,919
relations with china and russia peace in

60
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,560
the middle east

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,440
we all need a common strategy for these

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
issues

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,560
for the whole transatlantic alliance

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,958
unless

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,480
we want to be outvoted and outpaced by

66
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,599
the outside world

67
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,519
it is as simple as that

68
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,679
the legend of a sleeping knights is just

69
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
a legend a fictitious account

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,959
do we really want the alliance of

71
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,679
liberal democracies

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,840
turn into a legend a fiction invented

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,840
story as well

74
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,610

hi i'm steve clemons i'm editor at large

79

81
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,599
discussions

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,519
key discussions about global security

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,200
and national security affairs

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,879
today our job is to talk about

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,000
strengthening transatlantic

86
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,760
cooperation in times of upheaval i

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,920
almost want to rebrand this as will

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,599
transatlantic relations survive the time

89
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,720
of upheaval but i will leave that

90
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,480
uh to my fantastic uh two speakers and

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,000
contributors to today's forum

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,319
we have with us of course foreign

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,599
minister of slovakia yvonne korchok i

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,359
was just telling him he was

95
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
the slovakia's former ambassador to

96
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,400
washington uh

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,159
uh and that everything kind of went to

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,599
hell after he left town so we'll

99
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,439
we'll allow him to talk about that in a

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,920
moment but also we're very pleased to

101
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,840

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,518

i've asked them both to start giving a

106
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,159
quick snapshot

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,920
of the strategic map as they see it

108
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,840
but i want to add one dimple to that i

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,000
want to ask them if they were doing this

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,319
same discussion one year ago

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,478
what has dramatically shifted so let me

112
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,079
start with foreign minister korchuk

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,959

114

117
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,560
i've been so intensively in touch with

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
you

119
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,960
while in washington just five or six

120
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,840
months ago where i had no idea that my

121
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,638
stay will

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,440
will be over so soon back then so i

123
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,759
didn't

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,719
didn't make it just to just to meet you

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,880
in person before i left actually

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,360
uh philip you might remember you were

127
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,280
the very very last person i spoke to on

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,560
on the u.s side before i boarded the

129
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,400
plane which

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,840
by which i was flown in in a

131
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,799
repatriation flight

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
uh in the middle of uh march so it's

133
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
it's not

134
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,120
only a pleasure but it's an emotional

135
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,360
moment for me and i know steve

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
for quite some time and he indeed is a

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,440
great supporter of slovakia

138
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,120
and globsec and i want to thank to

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,560
globsec also for

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,759
allowing us to get into conversation uh

141
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,960
over issues that are so important uh for

142
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,919
us it's very flattering steve when you

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,960
say that everything

144
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,880
went to hell after i left but i do not

145
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280
agree with you because everything

146
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,280
went to hell everywhere when i left not

147
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,119
only in slovakia in the united states in

148
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440
europe but but globally

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,479
but look we will get over it i'm

150
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,800
absolutely certain

151
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,520
if we if we believe in our strength

152
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,880
in our values and and i think what is at

153
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,639
stake at this moment is

154
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,800
is not only how we deal with covet

155
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,360
that's in the forefront of our effort

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,360
but

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,400
we have to once again defend and protect

158
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,479
values because they

159
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,359
they have been making a strong for for

160
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,800
so many decades you asked us

161
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,600
as well to to share sort of strategic

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,199
outlook with with our viewers and best

163
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,280
regards to them as well

164
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,479
to all of them who are joining us for

165
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,880
for the session

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,440
but before that could i very quickly

167
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,840
just say that what keeps me busy at this

168
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,479
very moment as we speak there are three

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,479
things basically or three important

170
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
issues number one belarus and i'd be

171
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,880
more than happy to share with our

172
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,960
uh audience uh how we view the recent

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,680
developments which basically is followed

174
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,719
by

175
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,919
my entire world i i think i will not uh

176
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,639
exaggerate when i say so number two

177
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,520
recovery from from covet and that's the

178
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
issue

179
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,680
which is number one on top of the list

180
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,039
within uh in slovakia and within

181
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,680
european union and then

182
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,840
covet covered itself so belarus

183
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,919
what is happening there right now in

184
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,359
slovak slovak's government has made the

185
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,400
point very very clear

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,680
is unacceptable because we've seen

187
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,840
basically uh the the

188
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,360
regime oppressing people who are not

189
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,520
asking for anything

190
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,520
but what is the very essence of

191
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,560
democracy that their

192
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,919
voice is heard and not ignored

193
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,000
we've seen in manipulated and falsified

194
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,159
elections and this is unacceptable and

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
therefore our position is clear

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,160
and strengthened by a unified position

197
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,319
of 27 member states

198
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,680
that we do not recognize the outcome of

199
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,960
these elections

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,120
number two a response has to come and we

201
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,840
in the european union

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
have made it clear we will introduce and

203
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,758
impose sanctions

204
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,039
uh individually i mean targeting

205
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
individuals on

206
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,639
the russian side individuals who are

207
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,000
responsible for

208
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,560
both manipulating and the elections

209
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and also for the violence against

210
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,599
protesters

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
and number three uh we want to mobilize

212
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,039
support

213
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
support for the civic society in in

214
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,000
belarus

215
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,000
so that we in slovakia decided uh

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,160
for example that we will invite students

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,400
that can complete or start their studies

218
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,800
in slovakia many of them have lost

219
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,080
basically their places in the in a

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,000
school so it's

221
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,520
it's a response it's a clear position

222
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,639
that we are having with

223
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,240
uh belarus and it's this uh this support

224
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,280
that we want to provide to

225
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,599
people uh in in in belarus

226
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,799
uh two and i will wrap up that that

227
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,800
point on belarus if

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,639
if there is an interest i can say more

229
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,680
slovakia is part of troika

230
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,360
of oece we had the chairmanship last

231
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,439
year now we are together

232
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,440
member of so-called troika together with

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,479
the current uh chairmanship which is

234
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
albania

235
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,519
and the incoming presidency which is

236
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,720
sweden

237
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,000
i do see a role for oece

238
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,720
basically with the view to do our utmost

239
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,560
through an inclusive organization which

240
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,440
is oece to stop

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,399
escalation in in belarus to protect

242
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,480
people

243
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,880
but about all to start a dialogue

244
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,560
between regime and the civic society

245
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,600
and and political representatives of

246
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,399
of belarusian so i i'm absolutely ready

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,920
to

248
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,720
actively be engaged in in that process

249
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,640
uh number two eu and recovery i don't

250
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,279
want to take in my intro too much

251
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,600
of of my time right this is the issue

252
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,640
number one in europe we need to recover

253
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,279
because the impact is severe on

254
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,360
all economies in in the world including

255
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,640
in in slovakia where we see it

256
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,200
in addition to you know to re to what we

257
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
want

258
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,440
achieve recovering economy also

259
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,399
modernize our society

260
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
and covet still keeps us busy in

261
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,959
slovakia

262
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,279
we've been doing extremely well compared

263
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,680
to

264
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,120
to other nations struggling with with

265
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,199
the virus

266
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,399
but now obviously we have entered a

267
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
second wave so

268
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,399
as i speak right now we are introducing

269
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,199
restrictive measures

270
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,240
to protect our people i don't know steve

271
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,920
whether

272
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,880
after those three points which as i said

273
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,560
keep us busy in slovakia but i'm certain

274
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,160
in the united states as well

275
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,640
should i immediately start with the

276
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,480
strategic outlook or should i pass on to

277
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,399
to phillips so that i don't why don't we

278
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,920
check in with ambassador rieker and

279
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,279
we'll come back and we can go back and

280
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
forth but that's okay with you

281
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,079
um uh phillip um what you know give us

282
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,399
your map and your priorities right now

283
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,560
what's um what's burning on your desk

284
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,519
well thanks uh stephen and uh yvonne

285
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,839
great to see you too

286
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,000
uh hello to everyone at globesec wish we

287
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,600
were together in uh in bratislava or

288
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
even better in the tatras

289
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,040
uh but it's terrific that we've all

290
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,279
learned to use these

291
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,719
these platforms and the technology to

292
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,079
maintain this kind of dialogue

293
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,800
particularly important

294
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,599
in the transatlantic relationship and of

295
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,800
course that's

296
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,519
what i focus on is our relationship with

297
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,719
50 countries that the bureau of european

298
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,519
affairs

299
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,399
focuses on our 79 diplomatic posts

300
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,279
abroad

301
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,240
uh our travel and engagement which is uh

302
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,439
starting up again

303
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,959
slowly uh but covet being the big focus

304
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,040
that's the biggest difference of course

305
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,199
uh between now and a year ago

306
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,000
we've all had to adjust to the pandemic

307
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,279
and we're looking at recovery the most

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,680
important part of that

309
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,399
is going to be doing that together with

310
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,239
a

311
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,440
transatlantic economic and investment

312
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
relationship

313
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
in the trillions of dollars that's going

314
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,279
to be key for all of us getting our

315
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,440
economies restarted again

316
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,439
and also focusing on on resilience what

317
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,560
do we learn from the pandemic what steps

318
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,480
do we need to take

319
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
to be able to uh to deal with this in

320
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,680
the future even as

321
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,959
uh the unfolding uh of the pandemic

322
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,638
spikes and and potential new waves are

323
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,959
things we've got to contend with

324
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,440
hoping to open up travel again but but

325
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,000
mindful of the epidemiology

326
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,279
the challenges we face there on a

327
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,680
consular

328
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,600
basis as we look at it taking care of

329
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,239
our citizens whether it was repatriating

330
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,000
them

331
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,519
by the tens of thousands and now

332
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,720
trying to get business and tourism and

333
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,320
educational travel up and going again

334
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,920

335
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,600

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,079
on

343
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,519
the problems in belarus and our support

344
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,479
for the belarusian people they just

345
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,120
celebrated

346
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
their independence day yesterday and it

347
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,639
reminds us

348
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,040
of our strong support uh which we share

349
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,839
across the atlantic for the sovereignty

350
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,519
uh and independence of belarus but also

351
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,959
for the people of belarus to have a

352
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,000
government that delivers

353
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,479
for them we of course are focused uh

354
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,160
still

355
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,880
on the challenges uh posed by russia

356
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,920
uh posed by china also in europe and

357
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,320
we've been having

358
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,360
increasing dialogue uh including in in

359
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,000
central europe

360
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,160
where i traveled with secretary pompeo

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,360
just a couple of weeks ago

362
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,880
a year ago in 2019 we were in uh

363
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,720
in slovakia in bratislava

364
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
then ambassador to the united states

365
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,200
korchok was able to join us

366
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,800
uh on that visit we reprised that a

367
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,399
little later than we'd hoped but

368
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:32,000
including this time prague slovenia

369
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
vienna and and poland uh reminding us

370
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,880
that our

371
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,719
dialogue with europe spreads from

372
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,079
traditional partners of course

373
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,279
paris berlin london but also to our our

374
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,120
colleagues and allies in

375
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,279
in central europe so a lot on on the

376
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,639
agenda and very pleased

377
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,839
to be doing so much with colleagues like

378
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,839
uh ivan

379
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,959
out of bratislava and groups like

380
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,399
glocsek which are supported

381
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,399
well thank you thank you very much for

382
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,320
that ambassador rieker and i know you

383
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
know recently you were in poland i know

384
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,480
uh that where us is adding a thousand

385
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,680
new forces to rotational forces there

386
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,199
so there are these elements and

387
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,719
ornaments if you will of american

388
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,519
engagement in the world but as

389
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,800
as foreign mr korchak comments about the

390
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,399
strategic outlook

391
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,319
one of the topics we've had in global

392
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,800
globe sec before is whether america was

393
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,360
sort of in a strategic contraction mode

394
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,479
when you see g7 leaders particularly

395
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,720
european leaders say

396
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,160
they'd rather not attend a g7 summit

397
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,760
they're sort of reflection of

398
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,959
you know some turbulence out there in

399
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,959
the relationship that i want to make

400
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,319
sure that we get in our conversation

401
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,800
so i'm going to just ask it on the front

402
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,440
end as you share your strategic outlook

403
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,000
um

404
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
for mr korchok i i'd also like to get a

405
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,639
sense of

406
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,119
whether you see america robustly engaged

407
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,560
sort of steady state or slipping back

408
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,920
foreign minister well i you would not uh

409
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,599
expect me to uh directly respond

410
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,160
with exactly your your words but

411
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,839
in in a 30 seconds i come back just for

412
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,000
a second in

413
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,320
back to belarus because i forgot to

414
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,560
mention one important thing

415
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,519
when talking about belarus of course

416
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,040
what matters

417
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,199
is what we see on the ground

418
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,880
that's decisive but at the same time we

419
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,959
cannot ignore

420
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:20,480
that a propaganda and disinformation

421
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,760
war is underway as well in parallel

422
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,560
and we in central europe realize it

423
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,480
maybe a bit more than our partners in

424
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,638
the west in europe

425
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,800
in the west of europe or in the united

426
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,320
states but we see

427
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,399
how much the conspiratory scene

428
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,000
and those who are spreading propaganda

429
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,880
and disinformation are active

430
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,560
right now and today i had a conference i

431
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,800
just wanted to tell you because

432
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,800
i i believe it is our duty to

433
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,758
communicate with the with the broad

434
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,800
audience

435
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,160
in slovakia and central europe to make

436
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,439
clear that you know those who are

437
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,959
who are spreading this information they

438
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,079
are using a very targeted

439
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,040
language and slogans in order to

440
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,479
really disorientate uh people and

441
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,639
question the

442
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
you know the the fundamental the

443
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,639
fundamental

444
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,519
uh pillars of of our foreign policies

445
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,360
and

446
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,360
there are five slogans that we in

447
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
slovakia have identified in that

448
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,720
propaganda

449
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,240
war number one modernization with a

450
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,399
clear reference to what

451
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,880
we've seen 2014 in in ukraine number two

452
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,839
uh it's lukashenko himself but others as

453
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,560
well joining him

454
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,880
in spreading basically the news that

455
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,359
nato was mobilizing troops and moving

456
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,120
them

457
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,079
throughout the baltic countries and in

458
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,720
in poland which we all know is not true

459
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,359
number three protesters are being pained

460
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,519
paid

461
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
from abroad and therefore basically

462
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,279
there is a third party involvement in

463
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,920
that bella russia

464
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,360
will turn into i quote what we are

465
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,120
hearing in slovakia

466
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,400
into a nato's or european union's colony

467
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,640
and number five the fifth slogan uh

468
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,640
with which the propaganda is working

469
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,000
that protesters are

470
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,199
are using fascist symbols because we see

471
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,240
uh really the wide red uh white

472
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,079
uh flag being used and we we should

473
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,559
speak to our people and say it is the

474
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,280
old flag and under this flag lukashenko

475
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,280
was sworn in back in 1994. so

476
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,639
once again i i wanted to make this point

477
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,240
as well we shouldn't forget

478
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,440
that while trying to help stabilize the

479
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,080
situation

480
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,559
help below russian people uh to express

481
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,280
their

482
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,960
their their wishes uh freely right there

483
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,960
is also this propaganda war

484
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,559
underway and now back to to your

485
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,919
questions um

486
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,399
steve the the this is the question that

487
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,559
i was

488
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,840
asking myself when i was still in the

489
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,120
united states

490
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,240
what can we do uh with our transatlantic

491
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,799
uh transatlantic uh relations

492
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,880
we no doubt that we've been in recent

493
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,360
years and i'm not referring only to

494
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,760
the four years under the uh president

495
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,520
trump uh administration we've been going

496
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,799
through a very difficult test of

497
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,080
resilience of

498
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,240
of our uh bonds but basically

499
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,720
when speaking on behalf of slovakia i

500
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,919
want to make one point clear

501
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,280
strong transatlantic relation

502
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,360
this bond is the very essence of a

503
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,799
foreign policy doctrine

504
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,840
in slovakia we see no alternative to it

505
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,559
because it is based on how we experience

506
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,320
transatlantic relationship and bond and

507
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,160
the role the united states has placed

508
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,520
since we regained freedom

509
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,280
in 1989 nor we see

510
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,120
any other alternative under these

511
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,080
circumstances where we see

512
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
uh how rapidly the world is changing i

513
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,240
believe we should

514
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,600
see completely different and contrary

515
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,080
movement uh to each other to get us

516
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,000
closer to each other when we really look

517
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,399
at the challenges that we are

518
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,960
facing uh globally so number one there

519
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,360
is no alternative number two

520
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,360
if we want to maintain it we have to

521
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,479
recognize that indeed

522
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,600
there are other diverging views

523
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,799
between united states and

524
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,320
europe or rather european union you can

525
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,720
see it

526
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,799
when it comes to how we deal with such

527
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,000
phenomenons like climate change you can

528
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,039
see it

529
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,919
uh when it took us a bit

530
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,760
more time in europe to recognize what

531
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,720
rise of china will mean

532
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,280
globally uh what kind of phenomenon

533
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,840
china

534
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,399
represents with its uh with with its

535
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,159
growing

536
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,240
uh power we too um

537
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,440
have recognized that russia is an

538
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,880
assertive

539
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,720
player on the one hand and we do

540
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,720
disagree with them on many issues on the

541
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,440
other hand we need to engage with russia

542
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,600
because it is a player when we need to

543
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
engage when we want to resolve

544
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,039
other important international

545
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,600
international issues

546
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,960
technological progress it took us a gain

547
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,039
a while in in europe i

548
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,520
recognize uh to to recognize what for

549
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,720
example introduction of 5g would mean

550
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,200
when it comes to

551
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,120
right you know the level of dependence

552
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,080
on this technology and how to make sure

553
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,199
that it will not

554
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,240
represent a threat to to our security a

555
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,880
conflict

556
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,760
uh the the protracted conflicts uh

557
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,159
globally

558
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,120
being middle east and elsewhere in the

559
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,520
southern uh periphery of european union

560
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,918
we have clear position on that but we

561
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,918
have to recognize that there are

562
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,520
countries like russia and others and we

563
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,919
have to engage

564
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,440
with them and last but not least when

565
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,240
talking about transatlantic

566
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,600
tensions i would put it directly in with

567
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,760
this work

568
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,320
the relationship between united states

569
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,559
and europe it is a subject of my concern

570
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,720
because when i was and that's i mean

571
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,039
it's it's obvious it's public

572
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,320
that my concern when i was still in the

573
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,120
united states was that

574
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,600
on the u.s side we very often have heard

575
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,639
that

576
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,240
the eu is not maybe its closest partner

577
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,039
but rather

578
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,240
its opponents sometimes we have heard

579
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,640
let's say

580
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,280
the description of european union that

581
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,480
we are

582
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,039
rival that that we are an enemy i want

583
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
to

584
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,320
make clear we transatlantic relationship

585
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,840
can

586
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,960
only be improved if we improve

587
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,240
substantially uh relationship between

588
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,880
united states and europe

589
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,360
what should happen in order to make sure

590
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,760
that

591
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,799
you know the relationship will will be

592
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,919
maintained

593
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:45,200
uh dear stephen and philip i believe we

594
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,640
are we are desperately lacking what i

595
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,120
call a strategic

596
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,080
dialogue uh being established between

597
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,239
european union

598
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,918
and the united states no doubt that this

599
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
strategic dialogue is

600
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,679
is taking place uh permanently and

601
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,200
constantly between

602
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,000
unite i mean within nato but there are

603
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,200
many many

604
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,600
issues that can only be dealt with and

605
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,080
an address between united states

606
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,439
and european union take for example

607
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,879
trade this was a

608
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,120
very very hot irritant in in our

609
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,440
uh relationship that can only be dealt

610
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,080
with when we sit down and discuss

611
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,120
this issue uh between the united states

612
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,799
and european union

613
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,719
two i believe phil and this is my

614
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,679
invitation why don't we establish

615
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,919
something like

616
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:35,280
a regular at least twice a year

617
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,559
a a meeting between a secretary of state

618
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,879
uh and us european ministers it should

619
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,039
be

620
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,400
you know just on ad hoc basis when

621
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,280
secretary of state

622
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,880
from time to time is uh is spending his

623
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,080
uh layover time

624
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,880
in um when he's flying somewhere uh

625
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,960
i believe i believe we should have the

626
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,520
framework that we are having at least

627
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,880
within nato i believe it would help

628
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,400
otherwise

629
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,760
otherwise i think a sort of strategic

630
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,480
decoupling

631
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,440
could could continue because i don't

632
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,919
think

633
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,880
i don't think when we discuss

634
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,240
intensively

635
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,480
at length in details in depth right

636
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,840
issues of strategic importance we will

637
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,679
better understand

638
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,320
each other we will better understand

639
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,520
what is the us position to iran we will

640
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,158
better understand

641
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,679
why the united states has taken position

642
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,120
on climate change

643
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,360
why unilateral decisions are sometimes

644
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,559
you know better option for the us than

645
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,479
multilateral

646
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,678
options that we are seeking so that's

647
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,840
why that's my point

648
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,320
well let me let me jump in and and as

649
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,520
ambassador rieker shares his strategic

650
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,399
map uh let me ask him if he wants to add

651
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,960
another

652
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,080
uh inbox and outbox on his desk and

653
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,440
would you

654
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,879
uh respond to the minister's call for

655
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,000
a more structured and more um

656
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,840
ever-present ongoing strategic dialogue

657
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,279
of the foreign ministers of europe with

658
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,520
with the united states so ambassador

659
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,200
rieker

660
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,799
you know it's steve it's a it's a

661
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,360
question that comes up a lot

662
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,600
as you know in discussions here in the

663
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,879
think tank community

664
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,719
we have a very active dialogue with

665
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,720
europe how do you define europe is

666
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,919
always a the challenge

667
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,320
uh the european union uh

668
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,520
you know the commission the council

669
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,799
right now the germans have the

670
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,158
presidency of that

671
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,840
we've been working with germany on a

672
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,799
number of issues that they've taken

673
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,799
great

674
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,158
leadership on from the eastern

675
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,200
mediterranean

676
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,279
to belarus and

677
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,039
we just have a very active agenda that's

678
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,600
been challenged by

679
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,279
uh by covid and yet we've continued to

680
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,240
to have that kind of engagement

681
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,080
secretary pompeo participated at a

682
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,039
meeting of the fac the foreign affairs

683
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,879
council with

684
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,559
all 27 eu foreign ministers virtually

685
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,080
we've been trying to schedule that in

686
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,918
person covet made that

687
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,678
and travel uh difficult but we did that

688
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,240
virtually we've talked about trying to

689
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,880
do that

690
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:11,840
uh again we've been pleased to accept uh

691
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,279
high representative burrell's invitation

692
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
to have a u.s eu

693
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,760
dialogue on china which i think will be

694
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,720
very important we're hoping we can kick

695
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,760
that off

696
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,679
after people get back sometime in

697
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,080
september

698
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,919
and that'll be an ongoing thing these

699
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,480
aren't one-offs these are things where

700
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,880
we have

701
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,240
lots of things to talk about we share so

702
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,279
much in terms of

703
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,000
the trade and investment agenda in terms

704
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,640
of

705
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,360
security obviously nato as ivan

706
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,000
mentioned

707
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,120
very robust for all of the neuralgia the

708
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,760
discussions the

709
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,479
the differences uh over the last few

710
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,240
years

711
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,880
nato is actually uh stronger uh

712
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,080
than than it has been uh it's got its

713
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,559
force posture

714
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,840
developing it's got command structures

715
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,039
it's taken on china

716
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,080
it's taken on the new threats like uh

717
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,559
hybrid and uh and cyber challenges

718
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,840
these are the kinds of things that ivan

719
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,279
alluded to when he talked about

720
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,199
disinformation one of the

721
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,480
things we have agreed with european

722
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,880
partners

723
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,720
is a real challenge whether it's russian

724
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,880
disinformation or efforts to

725
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,919
change the narrative to rewrite uh

726
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,760
history

727
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,200
uh and revise the end of world war ii

728
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,360
these are things that we've tried to

729
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,919
focus on in our travels as well

730
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,840
that's why it's important to go uh to

731
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,320
places why secretary pompeo

732
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,840
wanted to go to uh to pilsen and

733
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,720
commemorate

734
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,840
the allied liberation of czechoslovakia

735
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,799
why last year

736
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,158
we were in bratislava to commemorate

737
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,158
1989

738
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,440
30 years of course since the fall of the

739
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,600
wall

740
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,279
since the end of the cold war but also

741
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,760
look at the new challenges that we have

742
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,120
some of them brought about by technology

743
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,520
some of them brought about by

744
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,799
changes in the in the global structure

745
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,080
the eu has

746
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,320
enlarged and expanded we saw that uh

747
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,760
very much in the recent eu summit that

748
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,760
focused on the next seven years of

749
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,320
budget as well as the

750
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,879
funding for covid recovery the changing

751
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,600
roles

752
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,720
of uh countries within the eu brexit of

753
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,480
course is something

754
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,960
that we have had to uh all adjust to

755
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,480
we continue to support the eu and

756
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,840
enlargement for countries say in the

757
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,760
western balkans that have seen

758
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,039
euro-atlantic integration as

759
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,720
a key uh for their better future and we

760
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,679
continue to be very busy on that last

761
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,720
year we added

762
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,080
north macedonia the 30th ally to nato

763
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,320
and they are well on their way

764
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,120
with our support uh from the united

765
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,520
states but also so many countries

766
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,279
in the in the european union to uh to

767
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,520
moving toward membership

768
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,279
in the european union so i think there

769
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,520
is a great dialogue going on there we

770
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,799
can always look at new mechanisms

771
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,320
uh in which to do that uh but those who

772
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,440
sort of say well the transatlantic

773
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,279
relationship

774
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,399
uh is uh is you know fatally

775
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:09,919
uh challenged i think are are

776
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:12,479
wrong we can have

777
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,120
differences of opinion like any family

778
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,520
does

779
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,039
but those don't have to be divisions our

780
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,799
strategic competitors

781
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,120
love to try to divide us they love to

782
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,399
try to divide the european union itself

783
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,959
among its 27 member states which have

784
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,600
their own

785
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,919
differences obviously and tough debates

786
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,439
that's fine that's healthy but that

787
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,880
doesn't have to mean

788
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,799
that our differences uh or even disputes

789
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,960
turn into true divisions what we have is

790
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,320
something that certainly for 75 years

791
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,720
and in many ways

792
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,799
far longer than that based on a shared

793
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,919
set of fundamental values the concept of

794
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,480
the west

795
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,960
uh is is what we very much are focused

796
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,039
on

797
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,919
and we have to adjust and adapt that to

798
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,520
changing times changing challenges

799
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,039
i mean i mean let me just jump in here

800
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,879
and i should mention that we just have a

801
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,158
a a very few minutes left because we're

802
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,279
going to have a couple of questions come

803
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,120
in for both of you

804
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,440
um and then i know the minister has to

805
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,840
run but let me just ask what i heard

806
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,640
the foreign minister saying is we need a

807
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,039
little bit more

808
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,200
we need we need an opportunity to shave

809
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,720
and shape some of these challenges

810
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,159
on a more regular basis and philip what

811
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,679
i'm hearing from you is we're doing a

812
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,159
lot we're doing a lot already and

813
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,360
we're not we may not want to do more so

814
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,760
my question is if

815
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,240
if some if if right now we see a gap

816
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,360
between both of you and both of you

817
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,520
understand each other where they're

818
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,080
coming from why why not

819
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,559
add on uh another platform that might

820
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,520
give that opportunity to strengthen

821
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,200
um a more cohesive way with other voices

822
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,158
is is there some reason america doesn't

823
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,679
want to do that let me ask the

824
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,880
ambassador then jump back

825
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,520
to mr porcha no

826
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,200
absolutely very very precisely

827
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,918
formulated

828
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,120
i i've been making my notes while while

829
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,240
philip was

830
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,399
speaking number one i have to tell how

831
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,000
much i agree with him when he said that

832
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:06,239
nato has done a lot uh recently i

833
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,080
entirely agree that nato is now better

834
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,440
off than it was a few years ago

835
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,960
for example the this rebalancing which

836
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,679
is a very complex issue

837
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,080
but in europe i dare say and i can say

838
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,399
it

839
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,439
on the record and and publicly publicly

840
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,639
there is no

841
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,080
question no hesitation any more

842
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,600
present that we have to spend more money

843
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,600
uh if we want to still rely

844
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,799
on on collective defense which is

845
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,039
guaranteed through

846
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,200
article five it's not a controversial

847
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,120
issue anymore and that happened

848
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,640
in recent years and that happened also

849
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,678
because of the high pressure if you want

850
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,880
which we were exposed to from from

851
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,520
washington so

852
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,159
no doubt about it for sport uh uh forced

853
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,600
posture

854
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,200
within nato a clear us support which i

855
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,439
want to appreciate

856
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,720
for strengthening collective defense as

857
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,000
a response to

858
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,720
uh aggression by russia in in ukraine i

859
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,679
mean

860
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,919
no doubt about that so i agree uh

861
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,720
transatlantic relationship is challenged

862
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,480
but it's not

863
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,799
fatally uh so say uh damaged uh

864
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,799
not at all philip is also right by the

865
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,200
way because i've been serving in

866
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,399
the european union as ambassador for for

867
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,559
six years so

868
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,320
well i can i can tell you we are so

869
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,519
complicated and therefore philip is

870
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,200
right when he has but

871
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,960
to whom should we speak because you have

872
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,679
commission you have counsel you have

873
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,440
european

874
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,440
right european parliament what i'm

875
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,120
calling for uh phillip

876
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,440
is that we establish a really regular

877
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,678
and strategic dialogue on the on the

878
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,240
political level and here i mean

879
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,360
secretary of state of the united states

880
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,960
regularly

881
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,799
meeting uh with us ministers of foreign

882
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,440
affairs because i believe and

883
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,918
we've seen that recently two months ago

884
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,240
and

885
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,200
or when was it when we had a chance to

886
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,399
meet with uh with secretary pompeo

887
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,720
it makes sense uh really to engage in

888
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,678
that

889
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,279
open dialogue and i know that there is

890
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,000
readiness in in

891
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,360
in washington washington for that

892
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,480
otherwise

893
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,399
otherwise our we either stick together

894
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,159
or our strategic competitors will we

895
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:23,120
will be pleased and we must prevent that

896
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,200
with all means that we're having

897
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,559
let me ask ambassador rieker to jump in

898
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,640
and respond and then i think we're going

899
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,440
to bring a question in

900
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,600
ambassador weaker great no i think

901
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,000
yvonne is absolutely on the right track

902
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,879
the kinds of engagements and dialogues

903
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,880
we have

904
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,640
uh sometimes you do have to break things

905
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,360
down so a dialogue on china

906
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,399
i think is very well called for uh we're

907
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,918
moving ahead

908
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,080
with that as i said that's something

909
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,000
that is not a one-off iteration

910
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,840
uh there's a lot of things to talk about

911
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,399
there what what have we learned

912
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,840
in terms of the kovic crisis and

913
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,320
recovery from that

914
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,959
what about reciprocity uh things like

915
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
the 5g

916
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,399
issues and dealing with new technologies

917
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,720
those have gotten a lot of attention

918
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,559
the fundamental issue there is is simply

919
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,159
what we've learned and realized we were

920
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,519
late to the game in terms of some of the

921
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,320
threats and challenges

922
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,919
from china in in that sector and wanting

923
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,639
to share that with our friends and

924
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,799
allies

925
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,760
and help them understand uh what we all

926
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,639
need to bring

927
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,158
aware of in terms of uh chinese

928
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,039
activities

929
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,679
we have lots of avenues uh for that kind

930
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,399
of broad

931
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,960
broad dialogue we have in case nobody's

932
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,518
noticed

933
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,880
an election coming up in the united

934
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,240
states in a few weeks

935
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,880
uh and however that turns out we will

936
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,080
have uh after january either a second

937
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,960
trump administration

938
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,360
or biden administration uh and and those

939
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,039
are

940
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,479
then the next steps we'll have to take

941
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,399
in in moving with that

942
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,080
we have a full calendar of engagements

943
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,639
as i said the secretary was just in

944
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,799
in europe i expect he'll be there again

945
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,440
before long the deputy secretary

946
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,039

947

uh from the eu so we have the phone

949
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,679
number or phone numbers might be the

950
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,200
better way to put it lots of contacts

951
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,600
and and one of the ones i appreciate the

952

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,319

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,599
that we've been

992
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,839
engaged the secretary of state uh with

993
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,720
both our allies greece and turkey

994
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,720
when he was traveling in central europe

995
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,200
he met with the greek foreign minister

996
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,118
dendias in vienna a couple days later

997
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,839
with the turkish foreign minister

998
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,280
uh our ambassadors in both countries are

999
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,520
very engaged you mentioned

1000
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,720
the germans they have been playing an

1001
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,839
important role

1002
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,560
uh in their uh not only as as germany of

1003
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,160
course

1004
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,880
an ally in nato with both of those

1005
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,560
countries

1006
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,560
but also as president uh in their

1007
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,599
presidency of the european union

1008
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,119
uh this semester uh they need to have a

1009
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,880
dialogue they need to keep

1010
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,320
uh talking that's always been the

1011
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,560
solution richard holbrook would have

1012
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,720
said that too uh

1013
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,680
he knew well the importance of of

1014
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,319
diplomacy

1015
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,720
and uh and engagement i think a lot of

1016
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,200
that

1017
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,640
as we're learning like in forums like

1018
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,399
this can take place

1019
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,440
uh perhaps uh less uh in the

1020
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,640
public eye uh and with major

1021
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,920
trips or travel uh but the conversations

1022
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,118
and uh urging both sides to uh

1023
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,480
be careful in uh what they do what they

1024
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,240
say to remember the importance of uh

1025
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,760
our alliance and that they do have

1026
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,240
channels for communication

1027
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,440
i think both countries egypt and uh

1028
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,560
greece and turkey

1029
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,640
know that uh and the mediterranean uh

1030
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,240
is is a tough place it's got a long and

1031
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,520
complicated history

1032
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,959
uh but we're continuing to work on that

1033
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,400
thank you foreign minister korchak i'm

1034
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,839
going to give you the last word and i'd

1035
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,040
love to hear your thoughts on this as

1036
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,440
well but as you close

1037
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,119
i follow you on twitter and you had a

1038
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,920
powerful picture on twitter the other

1039
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,480
day

1040
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,839
of the bella russian uh ambassador to

1041
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,920
slovakia

1042
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,359
seeing you as he departed his post

1043
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,000
because he had resigned

1044
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,078
to align himself um with the the

1045
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
opposition with with the people um

1046
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,440
uh who are raising questions uh of

1047
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,400
course about leadership in the election

1048
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,240
in belarus

1049
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,920
um i'd like you to do this but just as

1050
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,680
we close i'd love to get your thoughts

1051
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,920
about that because that seemed to me

1052
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,598
a very brave thing he was doing but it's

1053
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,520
also you were holding that up

1054
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,640
as a moment of leadership that mattered

1055
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,160
to you so in

1056
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,078
in our final couple of minutes i'd love

1057
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,440
to get a snapshot of both turkey and

1058
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,960
that

1059
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,359
well on turkey of course we are

1060
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,839
absolutely concerned over what we've

1061
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,078
seen recently in the east mediterranean

1062
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,680
area the european union and slovakia as

1063
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,880
a part of it we've been dealing with

1064
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,759
that issue

1065
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,599
i mean within all recent foreign affairs

1066
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,200
councils that that we have had we will

1067
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,240
be dealing with that issue as well

1068
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,439
tomorrow in

1069
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,879
in berlin opposition is clear

1070
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,000
we been expressing our solidarity

1071
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,480
with uh with cyprus

1072
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,680
and greece their sovereignty has to be

1073
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,880
respected

1074
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,399
in view of continuing drilling in the

1075
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,000
exclusive economic

1076
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,560
zones and number two we too

1077
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,760
view turkey as an important partner and

1078
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,640
i want to

1079
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,920
i want to say it's an ally i mean turkey

1080
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,240
is not just a partner

1081
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,359
it's a lie of strategic importance it's

1082
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,000
an ally within

1083
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,078
within nato and therefore the only

1084
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,280
solution and that's the moment for

1085
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,560
diplomacy and therefore therefore i

1086
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,760
absolutely support

1087
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,440
all attempts and engagements as those

1088
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,920
for example that we've seen

1089
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,640
by by germany recently unfortunately it

1090
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,880
didn't work

1091
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,160
uh immediately but i know high commas

1092
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,800
was here in brazil

1093
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,359
last friday i think the other day he was

1094
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,480
also in

1095
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,440
in athens recently but i i'm absolutely

1096
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,400
certain that

1097
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,640
political responsibility and engagement

1098
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,920
in

1099
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,960
this combination i think will lead us to

1100
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,800
really scaling down the the escalation

1101
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,240
which is not a pleasant thing that we've

1102
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,960
seen recently right

1103
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,439
and and number two with the ambassador

1104
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,920
of

1105
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,000
belarus who have been has been serving

1106
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,040
in slovakia for four years

1107
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,720
well indeed this is extraordinary move

1108
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:37,520
we are diplomats both phil and me and

1109
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:41,040
i have my comment was uh basically that

1110
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,000
his own story confirms that even

1111
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,279
diplomats

1112
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,880
are from time to time reaching really

1113
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,520
red lines

1114
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,359
and they recognize that you know this

1115
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,680
red lion was crossed

1116
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,720
by in this case by his own government

1117
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,598
and it does not

1118
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,200
allow him anymore to serve his own

1119
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,359
country as a diplomat but is a

1120
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,319
right to the courageous move which has

1121
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,799
deserved

1122
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,680
a lot of respect in slovakia and belarus

1123
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,640
he left

1124
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,640
uh i think yesterday physically slovakia

1125
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,279
he's on his way to belarus

1126
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,240
and we told him whenever he believes he

1127
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,400
he wants to

1128
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,319
re-engage with us whatever he needs we

1129
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,960
will we will support him but that was

1130
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,359
something

1131
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,400
you know which only confirms how serious

1132
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,598
the situation

1133
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,040
is uh in in belarus and that's why

1134
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,319
it is so high on our agenda these days

1135
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,599
well listen we're going to have to end

1136
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,400

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,960
well i think that from what i have seen

1165
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,720
globetrot has convened a very

1166
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,359
impressive group of people that are

1167
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,839
subject matter experts on our most

1168
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,839
pressing
