my name is alina kutzko

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,040
and i'm director of the globsec policy

institute

7
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,279
the case for the enhancement of european

8
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,560
defense is resounding

9
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,200
however european defense needs nato

10
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,399
and will not be credible without nato at

11
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,880
its core

12
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,440
in light of the increasing rivalry

13
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,320
between

14
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,160
great and emerging powers and the change

15
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,279
in nature of security

16
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,800
neither europe nor the us can afford to

17
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,439
go it alone

18
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,399
the ultimate goal of european defense

19
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,680
should not be

20
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,120
the denaturization of europe but rather

21
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,959
a

22
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,959
europeanization of nato that strengthens

23
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,319
the atlantic alliance

24
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,959
the rationale for moving forward is

25
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,680
self-explanatory

26
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,079
prosperous democracies must be capable

27
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
of

28
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,120
adequately protecting themselves and

29
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,079
their citizens

30
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,680
from external threats security cannot be

31
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,880
fully subcontracted

32
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,120
even to a staunch and reliable ally the

33
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,480
more european defense in nato

34
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,279
the more nato will defend europeans

35
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,399
furthermore the transatlantic alliance

36
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,160
needs to engage

37
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,440
the broader and political and

38
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,079
technological west

39
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,600
from around the world including partners

40
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,319
in the asia-pacific region

41
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,199
and late in america european defense

42
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,680
will need to be linked to the world

43
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,359
globsic european security initiative is

44
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,680
our flagship initiative

45
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,920
that aims to critically analyze the

46
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,519
current state of development of european

47
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,680
defense capabilities

48
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,040
and put forward a strategic vision of

49
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,599
european defense

50
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,959
in light of this context what is a

51
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,360
feasible and desirable

52
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,560
level of ambition of european defense

53
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,480
integration

54
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,239
what measures can be taken to deliver

55
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,880
tangible results

56
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,839
we offer answers to these questions and

57
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,839
much more

58
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,920
within the initiative and are looking

59
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:13,660
forward to working with you on refining

60
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:22,339

with whom i will debate the issue of

73
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,079
resilience and to what extent we are

74
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
witnessing

75
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,279
a game-changing moment in how we

76
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,279
understand resilience

77
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,680
and whether or not resilience is

78
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,880
becoming a new premium feature or a new

79
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,000
kind of asset

80
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,480

well

95
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,880
and i would like to kick start this

96
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,839
conversation by asking my guests

97
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,240
what is resilience is it just a buzzword

98
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,440
that we have seen floating around in may

99
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,079
and april

100
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,279
is it a catch-all world or if not just

101
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,519
help me unpack it

102
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,639
how do we define it from where you

103
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,240
currently stand

104
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,839
and why should we care about it and

105
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,679
maybe we start with you phillip

106
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,918
hello everybody and thank you alex for

107
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,160
having me today um

108
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,880
tall order uh what we understand by

109
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
resilience when you reach out to me

110
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,319
on that issue of course i went straight

111
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,319
to my browser and searched for the word

112
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,319
to pick up you know the definition i

113
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,600
decided to pick up the definition that

114
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,599
was offered by the

115
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,918
merriam-webster dictionary an ability to

116
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,918
record to recover

117
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,559
or to adjust from this fortunate change

118
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,760
i would perhaps add that in my view

119
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,960
resilience is all about

120
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,240
preparedness to buttress your ability to

121
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,640
operate

122
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,080
despite challenges it's not something

123
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,840
you do just once

124
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,360
or definitely achieve i think it's uh

125
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,280
both a mindset

126
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,479
a way of looking at things and acting

127
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,520
accordingly

128
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,120
and as joshua who's on our panel rightly

129
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,240
recently pointed on our

130
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,239
linkedin post it's an ongoing process

131
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,799
of awareness self-criticism and action

132
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,400
it's about business continuity where i

133
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,679
stand from which is basically from the

134
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,880
corporate world

135
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,240
but not just it's should be seen really

136
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,559
as a basic part

137
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,679
of any business's competitive advantage

138
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,200
matrix

139
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,600
its ability to adapt to adjust

140
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
quickly and effectively to a major

141
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,240
change

142
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,840
of either circumstances or disruption

143
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:37,919
but it should also really uh be about

144
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,760
contingency planning preparedness again

145
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,280
which takes us nicely back to josh's

146
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,039
post and the permanent

147
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,280
thought process that it implies it is

148
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,120
of course about mitigating impact

149
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,918
supporting business continuity

150
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,479
but it's also about ensuring that a

151
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,200
business

152
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,559
is able to bounce back more easily after

153
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,039
a crisis because

154
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:03,600
it has options which have been prepared

155
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,039
because resilience should be business

156
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,559
critical in my view

157
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,640
for corporates it's something that

158
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,280
should be squarely sitting

159
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,240
at the top of uh any organization

160
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,360
whether it's a

161
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,799
ceo or a ceo uh when

162
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,240
today it's often the remit when i'm

163
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,120
looking at um you know the people i'm

164
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
talking to

165
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,840
of the the cso the chief security

166
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,240
officer

167
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,799
and while there's clearly a security or

168
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,799
a process dimension to having um a

169
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,639
resilience policy in place

170
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,960
i would argue that uh resilience is much

171
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,240
more holistic um as a concept

172
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
than just security and therefore

173
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,039
requires a much more general approach

174
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,320
looking at an entire business and its

175
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,240
processes

176
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,600
you've asked briefly about some of the

177
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,039
key challenges

178
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,719
and i think this is exactly where we

179
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,879
often hit the wall

180
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
resilience is usually seen as something

181
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,440
within the realm of

182
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,039
the css function well it is all about

183
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,720
preparing for something that may never

184
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,440
happen

185
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,400
it takes time you need to focus on

186
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,200
foresight

187
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,159
risk assessment strategies it also takes

188
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
money

189
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,440
both um often in short supply uh for

190
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,120
something that may never happen right

191
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,320
so uh the approach that often followed

192
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,760
uh today um is uh often

193
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,439
focus on you know disaster preparedness

194
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,240
rather than a way of thinking an

195
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,840
approach

196
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
to have the tool and the processes in

197
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,039
place to face something which is

198
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,360
unpredicted but not unpredictable

199
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,679
thank you i will get back on the funding

200
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,000
and on the money that needs to to get

201
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,799
into it but i want to i want to go to to

202
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
my trade and

203
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,679
metro you have worked both with the

204
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,399
corporate sector but also with the

205
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,039
government

206
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,559
also the former culture of most uh

207
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,039
powerful women summit

208
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,280
um did you discuss the issue of

209
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,679
resilience uh with your counterparts

210
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,639
uh you're also based out of uk um and

211
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,559
there are quite some

212
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,080
some some concerns with regards to the

213
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,120
bouncing back of the country

214
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,280
um amid um copy 19. so

215
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,678
um i would be happy to to hear your

216
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,799
thoughts in that regard

217
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,640
i think it's interesting right

218
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,039
resilience the first time i ever heard

219
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,960
of it

220
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,440
of the word in terms of a business

221
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,520
context was back 109

222
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,799
pretty much around the time when the

223
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,600
world was trying to grapple with the

224
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,080
after

225
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,959
aftermath of lehman collapse um and it

226
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,120
was in a very

227
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,960
small it was in a smaller context and

228
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,239
philip was absolutely right that it was

229
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,320
in the context of

230
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,919
how do you tackle a crisis that may come

231
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,240
the next time around and people used to

232
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,559
talk about the new normal in those days

233
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,440
i think the the concept of what we're

234
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,559
seeing today

235
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,840
is a concept that a handful of companies

236
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,200
that i've been speaking with over the

237
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,600
last 10 years

238
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,559
have brought about the concept of the

239
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,039
next normal

240
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,240
everyone is concerned not about a new

241
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,919
normal but the fact that

242
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,240
every year there's going to be a new

243
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,360
crisis it's going to be unpredictable we

244
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,280
just don't know what it's going to be

245
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,240
this time around we've been hit by

246
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,360
two it's a health crisis and it's an

247
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,200
economic crisis

248
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,760
how do you deal with that it's global in

249
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,320
its nature and the speed of it is huge

250
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,799
and it's impacting disproportionately

251
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,879
people

252
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,158
um who would be vulnerable that we

253
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,400
thought we were helping

254
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,159
and they've been forgotten and a lot of

255
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
the points that resilience that philip

256
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,679
brings about

257
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,159
in certain companies and certain

258
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,440
organizations and in certain governments

259
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,880
has been that of being siloed being with

260
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,120
the chief security officer

261
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,320
but the successful companies uh over the

262
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,000
last 10 years and the ones that are

263
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,080
actually doing rather well

264
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,120
um through this crisis have been

265
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,199
companies where

266
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,158
the entire c-suite has bricked up on

267
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,559
resilience

268
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,840
and made it a core part of strategy and

269
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,280
it's really about

270
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,760
openness and the ability to change um

271
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,559
and the ability to change culture have a

272
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,919
war chest

273
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,600
um have a diversified um portfolio that

274
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,320
in terms of both customers and supply

275
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,959
chains

276
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,320
all of that built into just the psyche

277
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,000
of the organization

278
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,520
to say hey ho we don't know what's

279
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,760
coming up next

280
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,039
so we're going to try to be resilient no

281
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,000
matter what the next

282
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,720
normal is the one thing i will say is

283
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,400
that

284
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,640
looking at it from a perspective of the

285
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,240
most vulnerable or the the communities

286
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,200
that get affected the most

287
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,320
it would be women and we've heard a lot

288
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,159
of talk about

289
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
resilience when it comes to both

290
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,559
organizations being companies

291
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,840
or governments where women are going to

292
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,080
get left behind and you've got to

293
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,399
remember with the 400 million

294
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,039
full-time job losses we're expecting to

295
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,600
see this year alone across the world

296
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,960
you've got a disproportionate number of

297
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
women that are going to get

298
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,880
impacted because a number of governments

299
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,399
number of companies

300
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,480
have not thought about resilience

301
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,600
they're not thinking in the long term

302
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,440
about how those big gaps and also the

303
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,918
gender inequality increases

304
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,559
is going to actually have a long-term

305
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,640
effect

306
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,000
now the ones that are doing it know that

307
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,720
turbulent times

308
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,559
means scenario planning means resilience

309
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,080
means the ability to bounce back no

310
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,120
matter what happens next

311
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,840
so the context of resilience for me

312
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,678
is forward planning no matter what

313
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,480
scenario arises

314
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,200
does that make sense that makes a lot of

315
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,520
sense and

316
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,480
uh i will follow up also on on the issue

317
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,799
of

318
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,640
most vulnerable groups and who has the

319
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,279
responsibility for for it at the end of

320
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,360
the day

321
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,000
and i want to move to you josh because

322
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,399
from where you stand in paris the ostd

323
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,159
is looking at resilience and also the

324
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,880
other financial institutions

325
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,000
consider resilience as an indicator for

326
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,559
giving loans for giving

327
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
aid uh for how the countries are are

328
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,000
ranked

329
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,479
and uh contrasted against each other so

330
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,200
uh

331
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,799
what's what's new at the oecd when it

332
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,440
comes to resilience these days and how

333
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,320
do you guys

334
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,320
look at it uh in the convict 19 world

335
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,039
yeah thank you so much for the question

336
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,679
and uh i would just

337
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,080
preface it by saying that my role is in

338
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,360
the strategic foresight unit so i come

339
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,320
to the discipline of resilience from

340
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,479
a slightly different angle but i should

341
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,399
say there is extensive work underway

342
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,960
at the oecd on the topic of systemic

343
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,480
threats and systemic resilience with a

344
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,760
number of leading partners and

345
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,000
directorates

346
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,919
and a lot of that takes place under the

347
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,200
umbrella of the new approaches to

348
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,000
economic challenges

349
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,600
programme which in 2019 published a

350
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,480
paper on systemic risk and the

351
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,360
importance of resilience as a concept

352
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,640
in recovery adaptation in the event of

353
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,120
serious adverse

354
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,679
events and this year has also published

355
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,760
a paper on systemic risk in the light of

356
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,360
the coronavirus crisis

357
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,360
so a lot of this work actually

358
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,840
foreshadowed the situation

359
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:50,479
that we're in and that's available on

360
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:53,279
the oecd website and coronavirus hub

361
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,799
so our practice in strategic foresight

362
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,120
is a little bit different

363
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,240
um so the reason we do strategic

364
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,639
foresight is to make

365
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,440
better strategy and resilience is not

366
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,000
necessarily

367
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,480
a strategy in itself but it can be part

368
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
of

369
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,919
the overall strategy um

370
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,360
but if we take the definition of

371
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,200
resilience put forward

372
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,199
in the new approaches to economic

373
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,279
challenges papers that it's the system's

374
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,120
ability to prepare

375
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:23,440
absorb recover and adapt

376
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,799
in the event of a disruption then

377
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,919
strategic foresight

378
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,400
is indispensable to resilience so

379
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,919
think of a very well-known camera maker

380
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,200
that failed to adapt

381
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,440
in the face of big disruptions in its in

382
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
its industry

383
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,120
i think you all know i'm talking about

384
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,000
our ability to

385
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,959
absorb and adapt to new realities

386
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,360
depends on

387
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,600
our ability to understand what's going

388
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,039
on and to make sense of what

389
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,080
is emerging all around us and it's

390
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,039
often the case that organizations fail

391
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,399
to demonstrate

392
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:03,679
resilience because they are

393
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,400
blindsided or caught unaware of

394
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,240
what's really going on around them and

395
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,279
foresight allows us to

396
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,679
make sense of what's going on around us

397
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,760
today and the futures that are emerging

398
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,919
and therefore hopefully see the

399
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,120
weaknesses in our resilience that we

400
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,200
might otherwise have missed

401
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,360
thank you that's a that's a very very

402
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,159
important point that you brought up that

403
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,600
resilience is connected to to the

404
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,720
capacity to

405
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,760
foresee what will come next um

406
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,240
be that a black swan uh or something

407
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,240
that

408
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,440
we know is right around the corner like

409
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,399
climate change

410
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,799
um and um it's it's very important to

411
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,120
have

412
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,158
the the uh overall understanding and

413
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,879
awareness

414
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,679
uh when we are looking at the the

415
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,960
resilience

416
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,399
and capabilities building um dave you

417
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,840
have heard the definition

418
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,199
from the oscd uh they prepar prepare

419
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,240
absorb recover and

420
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,799
and adapt and uh maitreya also mentioned

421
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,799
that

422
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,639
um it needs to be a business culture

423
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,000
around uh resilience and

424
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,840
the sector you are in has been kind of

425
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,559
at the forefront of what has happened

426
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,678
since since

427
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,480
the outbreak of covet 19. so

428
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,200
how are things uh in your sector and in

429
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,799
your uh

430
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,200
company for example how do you look at

431
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,399
resilience and how do you prepare

432
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,760
for uh what's coming next

433
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,600
yeah it's a it's a very interesting

434
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,000
discussion i actually i

435
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,678
started looking at this uh i didn't look

436
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,679
at the dictionary first but i started

437
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
thinking about the covered era that

438
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,399
we're living in and i'm quite

439
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,520
pessimistic about the corbid era

440
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:46,559
and following mertra's idea of the next

441
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,720
normal i i do tend to think

442
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,000
that we're going to live with covid for

443
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,399
a good many years

444
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,440
regardless of how quickly a vaccine is

445
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,199
produced

446
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,799
it's not going to be about developing a

447
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,039
vaccine it's also going to be about

448
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,600
manufacturing it and delivering it to

449
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,158
8 billion people and if you look at the

450
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,480
news

451
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,360
of this week about the eradication of

452
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,760
polio in

453
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,199
africa how long have we had a polio

454
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,158
vaccine

455
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,720
30 years 40 years 50 years and only this

456
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,120
week

457
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,480
have we eradicated polio from from the

458
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,559
continent of africa

459
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,880
so i think we're we're in this next

460
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,879
normal for a good many years

461
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,520
and if not decades and i know that's a

462
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,600
very pessimistic place to start

463
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,720
but associated with that we're obviously

464
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,080
living therefore

465
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,480
in an era in an age of tremendous

466
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
uncertainty uh the schools are going

467
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,559
back next week

468
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,439
some of the schools have already gone

469
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,320
back in parts of europe will the schools

470
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,039
all be will the pupils still be at

471
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,559
school

472
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,240
across europe by december who knows

473
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,678
uh what would be the situation of

474
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,480
employment in

475
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,559
in the leading economies of the oecd

476
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,760
countries by christmas how many people

477
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,760
will be unemployed

478
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,520
in germany france the united kingdom the

479
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,320
united states by christmas

480
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,639
what is the future of curse our bite and

481
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,200
foot

482
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,960
and furloughing in in the uk all of

483
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,000
these are questions that we don't know

484
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,399
the answer to

485
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,919
so in that kind of an era i think

486
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,479
resilience takes on

487
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,679
a whole new set of definitions and

488
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,399
meanings

489
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,679
if we look at um the differences in

490
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,559
mortality

491
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,159
um in in the last six months i think

492
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,879
something stands out

493
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,520
which is that those countries which

494
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,520
tested

495
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:34,639
early did lockdowns quickly

496
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,039
uh had lockdowns which were compliant

497
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,399
which were not chaotic which were not

498
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,120
politicized

499
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,479
all of those issues led to all of those

500
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,279
that that

501
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,880
capacity of management led to lower

502
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,880
mortality

503
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,880
similarly government communications the

504
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,919
quality of communications

505
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,240
led to better mortality figures so

506
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,720
against that background

507
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,799
resilience becomes something about the

508
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,480
capacity of governments and the capacity

509
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,039
of organizations

510
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,000
to develop coherent policy and to

511
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,440
implement it

512
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,159
quickly so very very simply muddling

513
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,120
through

514
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,799
is is not gonna work um it's about the

515
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,879
quality of planning

516
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,639
it's about the quality of forward

517
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,880
planning and implementation

518
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,000
and i think that's what what resilience

519
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,799
is going to mean

520
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,880
in the in this era of uncertainty the

521
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,120
ability of organizations

522
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,279
to identify where they need to be i

523
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,279
think metro called it forward planning

524
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,600
to do the forward planning and then to

525
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,440
implement it in a coherent way

526
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,360
um and i mean in in the united kingdom

527
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,240
at the moment there's lots of examples

528
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,279
of where this is not happening uh if if

529
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,240
i may say

530
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,760
um whereas in other countries in in

531
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,480
europe perhaps germany would be an

532
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,120
example

533
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,080
of of a much better management of the

534
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,000
uncertainty

535
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,279
that we're currently living living

536
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,600
through so i would

537
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,799
i'd say that resilience is about that

538
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,158
kind of concept

539
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,240
it's about the planning and the

540
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,760
implementation and the coherence

541
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,360
of policy thanks david

542
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:14,080
that's uh that's a very uh indeed a

543
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,639
comprehensive way of looking at it but

544
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,918
you

545
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,960
did bring up the two examples um

546
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,679
that are rather opposite if i may say

547
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,880
the uk

548
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,799
and and germany and to to have forward

549
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,840
planning but also coherence

550
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,158
and quick implementation um requires

551
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,760
a lot and of course there are challenges

552
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,480
so if you could go back to

553
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,760
what philip already uh started bringing

554
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,679
the challenges

555
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,320
of um having this uh all planned out and

556
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,399
and ready to go what would be your out

557
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,760
of your your head now brainstorming with

558
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,559
us what would be the top three

559
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,919
challenges

560
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,760
for example for governments and

561
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,360
companies to to

562
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,158
have proper planning quick

563
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,719
implementation and of course a 360

564
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,720
degree view

565
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,440
so is that to me it is to you

566
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,399
so the challenges in the implementation

567
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,679
yeah well i mean yeah it's a big

568
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,799
question alex

569
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,159
um where shall we start well i think

570
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,080
one of the things that i think has also

571
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,039
become very apparent this week and if we

572
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,279
look at the example of uh again maybe

573
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,640
it's a bad example but but our world is

574
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,600
full of bad examples at the moment

575
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,760
rather than good ones

576
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,719
if we look at the case of phil hogan i

577
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,960
think one of the

578
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,640
one of the factors is going to be that's

579
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,480
going to be important

580
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,039
is what i call the elite public equality

581
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,159
um maybe we've called it solidarity

582
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,200
until now

583
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,600
but um i think elite public equality is

584
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,360
a better way of of looking at it

585
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,080
in the era of covid our political elites

586
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,120
and our corporate elites need to change

587
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,080
their behavior

588
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,039
or at least have a kind of behavior

589
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,879
which is

590
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:03,039
um more and more equal with the behavior

591
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,039
which is required of everyone

592
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,440
so there's going to be much more focus

593
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,199
on equality i think

594
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,040
and if we look at if you look at

595
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,158
president van der lyon's

596
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,279
terse announcement when phil hogan

597
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,000
resigned um it was a very short

598
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,440
simple thank you very much and goodbye

599
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,320
which sort of indicates

600
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,760
that we're all in this together and so

601
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,399
the big question

602
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,200
following from that the the really big

603
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,918
question

604
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,719
is the extent to which that demand for

605
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,399
elite

606
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:39,759
public equality is going to lead

607
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:42,399
to a reconstitution of equality

608
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,280
and inequality in our society more

609
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,879
broadly

610
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,520
and i really think this is one of the

611
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,040
interesting aspects of the covered era

612
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,000
and of course working in the healthcare

613
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,679
sector access to healthcare in europe

614
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,320
generally speaking is more or less equal

615
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,560
um and we as a society in europe we

616
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,720
believe we support the values of

617
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,599
equality of access to healthcare in

618
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,520
general and

619
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,720
and i know there are lots of discussions

620
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,759
we could have about that

621
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,680
but generally speaking our continent is

622
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,040
is a content that believes in inequality

623
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,040
of access to healthcare

624
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,599
but will that kind of thinking about

625
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,200
equality become much more prevalent

626
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,400
in other parts of the of society

627
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,240
there's a tremendous amount of

628
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,200
discussion for example about the

629
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,439
the page-shaped recovery the caged

630
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,200
recovery is a frightening prospect where

631
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,560
simply the rich get richer and the poor

632
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,839
get poorer and

633
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,400
and are far less resilient because of it

634
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,759
because of

635
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,040
their status their income and

636
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,079
access to commodities and and

637
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,320
um food and supplies etc

638
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,839
so if we're going down the route of a

639
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,920
k-state recovery

640
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,040
what does that mean for for our

641
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,680
societies

642
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,160
and i think uh addressing that issue is

643
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,680
going to be extremely important uh

644
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,200
going forward thank you

645
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,960
thank you dave i'll go back to you

646
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,720
maitreya because you brought up the

647
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,320
the gender inequality and the most

648
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,279
vulnerable groups and that's

649
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,599
uh connecting to to what they've said on

650
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,640
on the issue of inequality and how we

651
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,200
will look at it

652
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,879
from now on moving forward do you agree

653
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,000
that this is one of the greatest

654
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,920
challenges or

655
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
how do you see how do we increase

656
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,599
resilience um

657
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,359
what do we need what are the secret

658
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,240
ingredients

659
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,640
so i was talking about scenario planning

660
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,959
which

661
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,640
a number of very successful companies

662
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,240
who seem to be showing really good

663
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,400
earnings without having

664
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,359
you know laid off gazillion staff

665
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,359
members are

666
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,279
are showing you're absolutely right when

667
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,640
it comes to the inequality bit because

668
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,359
this is a number that the un

669
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,000
women put out literally a couple of days

670
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,520
ago

671
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,440
it said 527 million women um

672
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,280
across the four hardest-hit sectors

673
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,079
which is accommodation and foods real

674
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,920
estate

675
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,480
uh business administrative services

676
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,000
manufacturing and wholesale and retail

677
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,160
are going to be adversely impacted 70

678
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,599
of healthcare workers which david would

679
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,000
back me up on

680
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,839
our women they're going to be adversely

681
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,839
impacted they contribute about 37

682
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,920
percent of the global gdp

683
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,960
um and let's not even count the unpaid

684
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,280
work that they do

685
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,720
now think about what everyone's talking

686
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,400
about we don't know what's happening

687
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,879
with the schools even if kids go back to

688
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,240
school

689
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,599
when are they coming back home what's

690
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,319
going to happen with child care these

691
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,000
women

692
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,000
are getting laid off because they can't

693
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,480
work they can't go into work because

694
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,400
while

695
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,880
some countries will tell you go into

696
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,320
work if you need to

697
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,119
for example here um there is a pressure

698
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,079
from

699
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,520
companies that are not resilient who are

700
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,359
worried about their future who are

701
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,200
pushing their workers to come back

702
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,200
because they don't see any other

703
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,560
option because they didn't invest in

704
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,680
digital transformation

705
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,480
in time for example those companies will

706
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,879
have

707
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,800
issues with their workforce and a lot of

708
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,640
those workforces are going to be women

709
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,960
who are going to land up back

710
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,160
in their homes not able to get a job

711
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,200
because they're trying to balance

712
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,040
everything

713
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,640
um when you when you think about the

714
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,119
k-shaped recovery that david talked

715
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,319
about

716
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,520
a lot of the a lot of the bottom rung

717
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,480
of that cave are going to be women or

718
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,280
are going to be

719
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,200
people without the digital skills to

720
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,680
transition because we didn't invest

721
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,839
enough

722
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,078
in those digital spills in the last 10

723
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,320
years when we had the last recession

724
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,200
so we worked a lot about it but we

725
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,440
didn't do it

726
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,118
in a speed that it should have been done

727
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
when you look at the company i'm going

728
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,440
to

729
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,839
give you a great example of someone i

730
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,480
look up to in terms of as a company that

731
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,200
have done it

732
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,200
right which would be a sales force they

733
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,680
have their earnings they've had a pretty

734
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,680
good

735
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,720
run rate when it comes to keeping staff

736
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,480
uh on board

737
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,118
and they came up with a three uh

738
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,960
scenario situation they planned for it

739
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,720
um which was the most optimistic

740
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,320
scenario that everything goes right we

741
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,919
can do social distancing and every

742
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,800
everyone goes back to work

743
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,320
somewhere around the fall then you have

744
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,760
the second scenario that you get a

745
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,760
smaller second wave

746
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,560
uh requires another smaller look down

747
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,280
and then vaccines available by 2021

748
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,000
and everyone goes back towards the next

749
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,760
normal

750
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,079
and the third scenario that they planned

751
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,640
for is the most pessimistic scenario

752
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,560
that the second wave is huge that

753
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,480
everyone goes into lockdown and it goes

754
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,680
on indefinitely and there's no vaccine

755
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,320
in 2021

756
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,000
and everything goes to hell but this is

757
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,839
the company that's planned for it and

758
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,920
then planned its teams

759
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,520
they've done a lot of work internally

760
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,800
for their teams to make sure that they

761
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,480
can work remotely

762
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,400
they're doing that for their for their

763
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,960
customers now can you do that as a

764
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,640
government

765
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,640
i'm not so sure because governments

766
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,240
unlike companies are not thinking long

767
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,598
term at least in western democracies

768
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,160
you're thinking about the next election

769
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,720
cycle look at the u.s right look at

770
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,759
what's going on in the uk you have

771
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,919
issues where

772
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,599
if you want to be brave that next

773
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,320
election cycle is never going to let you

774
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,760
be brave

775
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,440
which means somebody's going to fall

776
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,800
behind and go into the bottom rung of

777
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,200
that care recovery if it happens

778
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,359
thank you and thank you for uh making it

779
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,960
so easy for me to segue towards source

780
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,680
josh because we heard

781
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
the we saw examples of the companies on

782
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,520
the spectrum from

783
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,400
no preparedness to a very uh good way of

784
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,480
looking forward

785
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,880
and indeed on the governmental side

786
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,520
things are running slightly different

787
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,240
and in addition we also seem to have a

788
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,680
tendency

789
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:31,040
on looking at what has already occurred

790
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,640
and prepare for that instead of looking

791
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,240
forward and prepare for the uncertainty

792
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,078
and for everything that might be around

793
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,439
the corner and we have no idea about

794
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,240
so how how do we uh merge those

795
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,599
uh two elements and how do we make sure

796
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,319
that the governments are

797
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,520
able actually to to look at the

798
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,240
resilience issue

799
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,400
more from the foresight um perspective

800
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,399
rather than what has already occurred

801
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,599
yeah i think this is a really good point

802
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,920
that reliance on the past as a guide to

803
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,359
how we're going to navigate the future

804
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,079
is a very limited way of

805
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,520
making policy and making strategy and

806
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,319
instead we should

807
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,200
be always finding ways to learn from the

808
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,599
future

809
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,359
which sounds a strange thing because the

810
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,560
future doesn't exist yet

811
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,480
it is still forming all around us so the

812
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,799
only way we can experience

813
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,359
and learn from the future is to imagine

814
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,440
it and that's what strategic foresight

815
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,960
is all about and when we talk about

816
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,359
scenario planning

817
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,200
the scenarios that we create are by

818
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,160
definition imaginary

819
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,799
and we create them in order to learn

820
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,520
from them

821
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,160
not necessarily to correctly predict the

822
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,200
future

823
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,799
and get it right but it's not just

824
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,000
enough to

825
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,560
do some scenario planning and as i

826
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,640
mentioned

827
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,200
in in the tweet that was quoted earlier

828
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,400
um it strategic foresight and resilience

829
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,520
are not something you just

830
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,920
do or ever definitively achieve

831
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,200
they they're a constant process and they

832
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,240
require

833
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,118
embedding in an organization's culture

834
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,279
whether that's a government or a private

835
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,880
sector organization or indeed any other

836
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,520
organization that has

837
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,800
a vision of success and a strategy to

838
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,680
achieve it

839
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,240
and uh i i pick up in that sense on my

840
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,200
trace

841
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,040
uh comment about organizational culture

842
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,960
that if you're just delegating

843
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,079
futures thinking or just delegating

844
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,839
resilience

845
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,760
and hoping that someone else will take

846
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,920
care of it then

847
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,680
the chances are that the people who are

848
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,400
really making the decisions

849
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,560
that affect the direction that an

850
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,960
organization is heading in

851
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,400
may not be privy to that information or

852
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,839
may not be able to take it into

853
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,599
consideration

854
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,640
um and likewise uh philippe also talked

855
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,720
about having

856
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,000
resilience and foresight at the top of

857
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,680
an organization

858
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,119
or what has been referred to and have a

859
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,078
business review as having an

860
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,880
authorizing environment for strategic

861
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,240
fights

862
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,319
um to take place so uh i really agree

863
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,118
with the with my fellow panelists

864
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,160
that foresight and resilience are a

865
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,560
capacity

866
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,640
that has to be constantly developed

867
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,680
whether that's in a government or in

868
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,440
any other organization

869
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,759
philippe i'm getting back to you because

870
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,960
you have worked with both the private

871
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,160
and the public sector

872
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,079
for for a good amount of time and

873
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,279
from your experience and from your

874
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,680
interactions

875
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,960
uh what is the private sector expecting

876
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,440
from the government

877
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,560
from from the government if i could put

878
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,000
it that way

879
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,920
um moving forward or even now in in

880
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,200
times of corona as they do their own

881
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,560
scenario planning

882
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,960
when we witness a complete um

883
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,680
stop and and blockage of our supply

884
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,480
chains

885
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,879
when we were not able to deliver good a

886
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,040
uh

887
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,000
from place a a goods from place a to to

888
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,040
place b

889
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,560
so what are the expectations currently

890
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,200
moving forward to help also the

891
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,400
companies

892
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,879
um get better prepared for for the risks

893
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,640
of tomorrow

894
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,040
alex can i take a david intro on that

895
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,078
one that's a really big question

896
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,640
um we're driving let me try the world

897
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,720
here now

898
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,480
let me try and uh take a a couple of

899
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,078
stab at it from from different

900
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,760
point of views i think if you're a

901
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,280
business and this is particularly

902
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,880
difficult in a crisis

903
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,319
but what you want to try and have is

904
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,200
actually consistency

905
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,960
um you know what's really difficult is

906
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,078
governments changing positions every

907
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,000
week

908
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,319
or every other week and we've seen this

909
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,680
really consistently across the board

910
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,560
uh in europe in the us and that goes

911
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,879
back to

912
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,839
um the various points made about the

913
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,839
forward planning

914
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,000
um being you know having prepared for

915
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,400
things we're very clearly seeing today

916
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,800
that

917
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,599
um whether businesses or governments

918
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,880
have done

919
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,079
little planning um or have disregarded

920
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,440
the planning i seem to remember there

921
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,640
was a 2006

922
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,880
um report by michel barnier

923
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,560
which uh was all about uh you know

924
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,280
pandemic preparedness and of course that

925
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,440
has

926
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,880
lived in a in a drawer for you know what

927
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,440
13 14 years

928
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,160
and suddenly everything was rediscovered

929
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,640
so

930
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,839
you know consistency um and probably

931
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,200
being able to

932
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:26,000
um work uh very closely together

933
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,960
as partners which um sounds sometimes

934
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,359
like a big a bit of a pie in the sky

935
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,480
but um it's about both the forward

936
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,400
planning we talked about

937
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,520
and the ability to communicate and

938
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,400
exchange

939
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,839
um let me take a a a simple example

940
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,319
which is more corporate

941
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,279
but uh where governance would have could

942
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,240
have um

943
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,640
a really big role look at the entire 5g

944
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,839
uh

945
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,839
discussion right now if um

946
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,960
if you were a

947
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,960
forward-looking business with resilience

948
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,759
at the heart of uh what the company is

949
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,040
doing

950
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,520
um being a c-suite issue

951
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,160
and of course being linked um as josh

952
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,400
mentioned to

953
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,560
you know forward planning you could uh

954
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,119
already six to nine months ago have uh

955
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,119
started

956
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,160
gaming the the possibilities and where

957
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,240
we are right now

958
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,440
both on you know the way the us has

959
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,680
moved um

960
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,480
the various stages of those moves and

961
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,680
what it means

962
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,280
um for europe if you're a business it's

963
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,440
incredibly complicated

964
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,960
if you're a european business having

965
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,800
some sort of

966
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,960
clarity and longer-term vision

967
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,319
from your own government or from

968
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,760
european governments

969
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,520
and that may be a bit of wishful

970
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,280
thinking nonetheless

971
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,280
uh long pollutant way of getting back to

972
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,079
you um it's both about

973
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,200
it's both consistency and uh open

974
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,079
communication channels

975
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,799
partnership if you will so that uh there

976
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,480
can be

977
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,119
some sort of preparedness and again

978
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,640
foresight planning

979
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,839
done around those issues

980
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,920
yes uh consistency i don't know i

981
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,520
might mentioned we're running against

982
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,000
the electoral clock usually so

983
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,280
consistency is not necessarily always

984
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,839
the the driving force behind the the

985
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,319
uh the public policy let's put it that

986
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,839
way

987
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,759
we have a a question from the audience

988
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:28,319
uh from andre matichak

989
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,319
who asks what does resilience mean for

990
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,000
for an ordinary citizen

991
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,079
what should they ask from their

992
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,680
governments but also from businesses and

993
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,160
how can they contribute and i think that

994
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,440
that's

995
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,279
the third element which is

996
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,040
extraordinarily important

997
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,640
to to bring into the equation is not

998
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,520
just about the governments it's not just

999
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,160
about the companies

1000
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,520
but it's also about our own citizens and

1001
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,480
what's their role and their

1002
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,920
participation

1003
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,359
in anticipating what will happen

1004
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,640
tomorrow and be ready

1005
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,119
to to uh absorb the shock and bounce

1006
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,078
back

1007
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:03,760
to a new type of normal and uh whoever

1008
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,760
one of you wants to pick this one up

1009
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,640
well let me be provocative let me just

1010
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,720
make the conversation even more provoked

1011
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,680
um and perhaps part of the answer to

1012
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,640
that that

1013
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,200
problem that's been raised is that the

1014
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:20,400
limits of the european nation state

1015
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:23,359
have been demonstrated yet again that

1016
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,040
this the crisis has demonstrated but we

1017
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,160
can't address these kind of

1018
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,279
issues um by definition a pandemic is

1019
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,000
way beyond

1020
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,800
a single individual country and as

1021
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,559
europeans

1022
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,640
i think it's very clear that we need to

1023
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,720
address this issue together

1024
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,319
and so it needs european capacity and

1025
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,640
european problem solving

1026
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,680
the first couple of months of the crisis

1027
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,118
demonstrated

1028
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,879
that europe was very poor at addressing

1029
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,640
the problem i think since since may june

1030
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,640
uh the european union has got much

1031
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,558
better at it and i think it's quite

1032
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,799
it's quite significant just what the

1033
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,280
european union has achieved

1034
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,240
since june july in terms of addressing

1035
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,640
the crisis

1036
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,919
however a lot more needs to be done and

1037
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,279
so that would be the first thing but the

1038
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,000
second thing to add to that

1039
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,000
is also the need to get beyond europe

1040
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,720
and thinking of europe as 27 member

1041
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,599
states

1042
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,000
if i look at the at my own sector what

1043
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,280
would be

1044
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,079
really important to know is sub-national

1045
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,880
data what is happening in individual

1046
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,839
countries in

1047
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,040
individual hospitals without relying on

1048
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,160
national governments

1049
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,680
as gatekeepers national governments of

1050
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,279
course have got an interest

1051
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,558
in addressing the needs of their

1052
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,599
citizens and the needs of their

1053
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,200
populations

1054
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,599
but if you look at it at a european

1055
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,640
level when individual governments

1056
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,440
start making particular policy decisions

1057
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,040
such as stockpiling or closing frontiers

1058
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,640
they're actually making the problem

1059
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,960
worse potentially

1060
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,799
so for example all of the vast majority

1061
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,200
of healthcare workers in luxembourg

1062
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,240
live in france or belgium so by closing

1063
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,919
the borders

1064
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,359
you're actually making it terribly

1065
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,920
difficult for luxembourg

1066
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,960
to manage its healthcare system so those

1067
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,319
kind of things

1068
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:09,280
need both a european scale of of of

1069
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:13,440
policy but also a significant focus on a

1070
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,440
stub national level as well

1071
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,359
my tray i get back to you because you

1072
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,760
also have a

1073
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,839
food somehow in the united states one

1074
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,400
also in in south asia and

1075
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:26,078
is what dave just said about the need

1076
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,480
for some national level

1077
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,280
also representative of other parts of

1078
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,160
the world not just

1079
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,559
europe and also is it actually possible

1080
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,598
uh

1081
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,599
to acquire the type of data needed for

1082
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,119
for this type of uh policy making and

1083
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,440
policy thinking

1084
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,760
we know that threats have no boundaries

1085
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,240
any longer they have no nationalities

1086
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,200
but at the end of the day they impact us

1087
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,799
um in a

1088
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,598
different way as we we we saw so far so

1089
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,240
what's your take on also the the

1090
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,079
citizens

1091
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,799
role in in the resilience or in

1092
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,200
increasing resilience process

1093
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,920
yeah i am what i think teresa may called

1094
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,640
the uh

1095
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,640
the citizen of nowhere uh the global

1096
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,160
citizen that belongs pretty much nowhere

1097
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,000
but to everywhere right

1098
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:14,480
um it's interesting when you look at

1099
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,319
pandemics that's one issue you also have

1100
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,040
climate change that's going to be

1101
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,800
part and parcel of every single crisis

1102
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,480
that's going to come in the next

1103
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,160
couple of years not even decades right

1104
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,040
but if you look at what's going on

1105
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,399
across the world there's only so much

1106
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,720
that individuals can do if governments

1107
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,240
and businesses are not talking to each

1108
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,078
other you can take personal

1109
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,479
responsibility for yourself

1110
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,720
um you can train yourself you can

1111
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,319
retrain reskill and constantly be

1112
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,279
skilling yourself to make sure that you

1113
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,240
can adapt

1114
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,240
to a changing work scenario but as an

1115
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,919
individual what else can you do

1116
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,078
you can be responsible with your

1117
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,280
community you can be participatory in

1118
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,359
your community

1119
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,760
um beyond that there's limited amounts

1120
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,598
that

1121
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,119
individuals can do whether they're

1122
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,720
dealing with climate change whether

1123
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,680
they're dealing with pandemics

1124
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,598
or economic downturns it really does

1125
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,558
come back down to communication

1126
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,160
all the way through from the absolute

1127
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,640
grassroots level

1128
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,640
all the way to the very very top of

1129
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,160
whoever is leading the country

1130
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,359
and that conversation i find especially

1131
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,359
in a crisis

1132
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,440
falls down and forth by the worldwide

1133
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:30,000
because everyone is

1134
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,720
kind of reacting in a knee-jerk way to

1135
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,800
the crisis

1136
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,919
at the present and not really thinking

1137
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,200
about the future

1138
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,480
so if you remember there was a very

1139
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,000
famous thing that was going around

1140
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,280
brussels um

1141
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,880
between uh 0809 and all the way up until

1142
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,480
probably 2015 where

1143
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,160
you know fix your roof when the sun is

1144
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,800
shining fix your roof when the sun is

1145
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,200
shining

1146
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,200
it's more than fixing the roof it's

1147
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,839
about making sure that that roof

1148
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,200
is so secure that it never breaks now

1149
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,359
the question is how much can an

1150
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,040
individual do to contribute to that

1151
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,960
there's a limited amount you've got to

1152
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,839
take personal responsibility

1153
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,000
but beyond that it really does come back

1154
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:09,359
down to communication between leadership

1155
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,559
it is about leadership leadership

1156
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,558
leadership at the end of the day

1157
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,839
thank you for that i want to to follow

1158
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,760
up um

1159
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,359
on your anecdote on fixing the roof and

1160
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,160
go to to josh

1161
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,440
because one of the probably most

1162
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,319
accelerated

1163
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,359
uh trend if i could say is this whole

1164
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,558
narrative of

1165
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:33,040
the globalization that covet lead us

1166
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,280
to deglobalize because we are too

1167
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:37,440
interconnected to interdependent our

1168
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,240
global supply chains are too fragile

1169
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,720
so we need to reshore desure whatever

1170
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,680
else

1171
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,160
to make sure that we are more resilient

1172
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,319
um

1173
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,680
how are you guys at the oscd looking at

1174
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,558
it is this something that you were

1175
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,160
worried about

1176
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:54,880
how are we able are we able to

1177
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:58,160
deglobalize while on the other hand

1178
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,160
increase our resilience

1179
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,480
i think the first thing to to come back

1180
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:06,000
to is um

1181
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,079
talking about uh defending against uh

1182
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,680
threats and disasters it's worth noting

1183
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,079
from a strategic foresight perspective

1184
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,520
that

1185
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,760
the future isn't just full of

1186
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,480
apocalyptic disasters that threaten

1187
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,079
the existence of humanity and it's also

1188
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,960
full of opportunities to

1189
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,440
learn and grow and uh you know the oecd

1190
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,119
is

1191
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,440
founded on principles of multilateralism

1192
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,800
and

1193
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,200
collaboration which have enabled

1194
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,079
an enormous amount of of growth and

1195
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,879
prosperity

1196
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,319
over over recent decades and so those

1197
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,000
are not changes that need to be

1198
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:41,440
safeguarded against their

1199
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,240
their opportunities to take advantage of

1200
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,280
um but just to come back to andre's

1201
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,359
question which is

1202
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,880
uh which is about what all of this means

1203
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,319
for ordinary citizens and

1204
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,319
what they should demand from their

1205
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,720
governments i think it's an interesting

1206
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,200
way

1207
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,240
to frame it and just coming back to what

1208
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,319
my trade was

1209
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,919
talking about in terms of individuals

1210
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:02,480
limited capacity

1211
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,760
to bring about change and the importance

1212
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,280
of leadership

1213
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:10,160
i absolutely agree and of course we

1214
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,960
do believe in the absolute paramount

1215
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,160
importance of

1216
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:17,440
experts and knowledge in in

1217
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,558
dealing with threats and turbulent

1218
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,559
circumstances

1219
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,880
and of course we believe in the power of

1220
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,520
policy to help humans come together and

1221
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,480
solve collective challenges

1222
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,160
that said leaders are humans too they

1223
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,520
they are just individuals

1224
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,598
and they they are

1225
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,799
always limited in the amount of

1226
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,319
knowledge that they

1227
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:43,119
can handle at any one time and experts

1228
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:45,359
are also just humans who may specialize

1229
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:47,119
in a particular field

1230
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,960
so when we talk about what we demand

1231
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,839
from our governments i think it's also

1232
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,359
important to

1233
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,558
recognize that governments always have

1234
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:57,920
imperfect knowledge

1235
00:55:54,559 --> 00:56:00,960
and are navigating turbulent times

1236
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,559
just as all of us are strategic

1237
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,200
foresight offers

1238
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,680
some ways in which governments can maybe

1239
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:11,839
hope to navigate turbulent times

1240
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:14,240
in um in a more adept and effective way

1241
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:16,078
um but i'd like to quote real miller

1242
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,959
who's the head of futures literacy at

1243
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,839
unesco

1244
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,520
who during this covid crisis has been

1245
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:25,440
drawing our attention to the fact

1246
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:28,559
that we need to let go of our delusions

1247
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,599
of being masters of the universe and

1248
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,799
capable of safeguarding against

1249
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,839
and preventing every disruption and

1250
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,640
threat that may

1251
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,839
come our way and a very important part

1252
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,799
of strategy is

1253
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:44,400
recognizing what you cannot change and

1254
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,960
finding other ways to

1255
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,559
face it and scenario planning

1256
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,240
particularly as a discipline of

1257
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,880
strategic foresight

1258
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,839
allows us to separate ourselves from

1259
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,440
what we cannot

1260
00:56:53,839 --> 00:57:00,000
change and control thank you josh

1261
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,400
it seems that we are really at the end

1262
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,040
of this uh fascinating discussion

1263
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,680
um and i would like to invite each one

1264
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,880
of you

1265
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:11,520
in 30 seconds uh to

1266
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,000
tell me whether or not resilience is a

1267
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,799
new type

1268
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,440
of asset moving forward in terms of how

1269
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,480
we look

1270
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,400
at future investments and where our

1271
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,599
political and economic capital will go

1272
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,680
on one hand

1273
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,599
and secondly imagine yourself in a

1274
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,240
position of advisor of someone very

1275
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,720
important

1276
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,759
with decision-making capabilities what

1277
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,598
would be the top

1278
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,440
three things that you would advise them

1279
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,520
to to take into account

1280
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,040
to make sure that they are prepared for

1281
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,680
the the risks of

1282
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,079
tomorrow maybe i start with you phillip

1283
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,960
because you

1284
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,960
started so

1285
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:50,799
good let me um

1286
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,000
you know 30 seconds three three points

1287
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,520
um

1288
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,359
i'd like to go back to where you talk

1289
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,359
about de-globalization um

1290
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:59,279
i think that uh globalization has

1291
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:02,558
brought uh the world

1292
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,400
uh incredible uh wealth um and

1293
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,599
let people out of poverty lifted people

1294
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,200
out of poverty

1295
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,599
and i don't think that you will see a

1296
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,839
massive trend necessarily back

1297
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,960
from the globalization on the other hand

1298
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,680
and these are things you need to be

1299
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,359
thinking about

1300
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,680
the environmental pressure and concern

1301
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:20,240
that we are seeing means that

1302
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,279
circular economy is going to take a much

1303
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,879
more prominent role

1304
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,640
and there will be a balance between both

1305
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,400
of them

1306
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,480
what does it mean if you're a business

1307
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,720
some things will need to be reshored

1308
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,559
not everything and even what needs to be

1309
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,520
reassured they will only be

1310
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,000
up to a certain level so it will go back

1311
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,680
to

1312
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,119
um again the planning and the

1313
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,000
preparedness what

1314
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,720
do we need to have where what makes

1315
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,760
sense

1316
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:48,000
uh in terms of being close to your

1317
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,760
customer to your consumers uh to your

1318
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,920
producer your production sites

1319
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,880
which will help you meet the societal

1320
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,240
expectations

1321
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,839
on the environment but also being more

1322
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,839
resilient because you have

1323
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,880
uh diversified i think that's the word i

1324
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:04,319
would use

1325
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:07,520
your supply chains and your

1326
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:10,480
um the roots that

1327
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,799
feed into the various markets you have

1328
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,680
uh and i will just finish by saying that

1329
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,720
um you know covet is an accelerator but

1330
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,720
a lot of those trends

1331
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,759
were here way before you can't

1332
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,160
understand

1333
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,119
europe's uh drive for uh digital

1334
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,000
sovereignty

1335
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:27,520
if you don't look at being more

1336
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,119
resilient and being more

1337
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:33,839
uh empowered thank you phillip my trade

1338
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,839
30 seconds

1339
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,680
well think of it this way no matter

1340
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,640
where you have your foot on the planet

1341
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,759
you've got to do

1342
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,720
a couple of things invest in digital

1343
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,799
transformation

1344
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,640
and reduce your debt make sure you have

1345
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:50,000
the money when the sun

1346
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:53,200
is shining you have to have to do that

1347
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,520
you have to be open to changing the way

1348
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,680
you

1349
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,640
look at uncertainty and how you deal

1350
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,759
with them and

1351
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,000
invest in your people when the sun

1352
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,000
is shining so that you don't have to get

1353
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,599
rid of them and lose their trust

1354
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,359
no matter whether you're a government or

1355
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,359
a company you need to keep the trust of

1356
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:11,598
the people so you have to change the way

1357
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,880
you look at uncertainty and the most

1358
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,760
important thing

1359
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,000
is communicate honestly with your

1360
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,160
stakeholders whoever they may be

1361
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,200
your customers whether they're your

1362
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,920
voters

1363
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,439
whether they are your shareholders

1364
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,000
communicate honestly about

1365
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,079
where you are what you plan to do and

1366
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,319
take on board what they think as well

1367
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:35,520
because that honest communication

1368
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:40,720
changes everything thank you

1369
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:43,759
josh i would say resilience

1370
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:46,879
foresights and leadership

1371
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,119
depend on strong values and

1372
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,480
often we talk about system performance

1373
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,240
and efficiency

1374
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:58,000
and the delivery of our policies

1375
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:00,160
whilst leaving implicit how do we know

1376
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,240
that we've got good performance and how

1377
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,879
do we know when we've achieved it

1378
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,879
how do we know what to prepare for in

1379
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,599
terms of the risks of tomorrow

1380
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,480
in other words why does it all matter so

1381
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,599
my

1382
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:15,280
final comment would be use the future to

1383
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,760
figure out what you value

1384
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,960
what matters to you as an organization

1385
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,839
or as a government

1386
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:26,400
and be guided by that thank you

1387
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:28,319
dave um i think equality is going to be

1388
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,000
extremely important going forward and i

1389
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:32,000
think not only equality but addressing

1390
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,680
the needs of the vulnerable

1391
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,559
so diversity inclusion the whole black

1392
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,399
lives matter

1393
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:41,200
movement and everything associated with

1394
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:44,640
that these are the themes of the future

1395
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,399
second um i think we all need

1396
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,558
to pay very much greater attention to

1397
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,200
what's happening in other environments

1398
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,079
in other

1399
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:54,319
countries as well as our own so

1400
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:57,119
interdependence and openness

1401
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:59,119
is going to become extremely important

1402
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,799
and finally and it may well be that i

1403
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,880
would say this wouldn't die but

1404
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:04,160
investment in health money and nobody's

1405
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,400
talked about money yet

1406
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,520
but money is going to be important and

1407
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,079
in particular

1408
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,038
investment bent on healthcare and in

1409
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,160
particular

1410
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:16,720
making sure that healthcare spending in

1411
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,640
in parts of the world where healthcare

1412
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,879
spending has been low in the past

1413
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,480
should be much higher in the future so

1414
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,640
an investment in health and a much

1415
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:28,319
greater equality in spending

1416
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:30,480
across europe for example thank you all

1417
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,319
for your valuable contributions and i

1418
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,720
would like to inform our audience that

1419
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:36,960
our next session will start momentarily

1420
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,399
and stay tuned as sim judah of the

1421
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,319
economist will lead our next

1422
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,039
conversation on the trend

1423
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:44,960
a more geopolitical eu amid growing

1424
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:48,040
instability in the neighborhood

1425
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:54,409
thank you so much for watching us

1426
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:54,409
[Music]

1427
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,079
globesec bratislava forum is the

1428
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,759
platform to tackle disruption

1429
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,240
and discuss solutions for better

1430
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,079
tomorrows

1431
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,359
basic theme of disruption is crucial

1432
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,960
because to me

1433
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,720
the issue is not whether it's climate

1434
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,000
change or whether it's the chinese or

1435
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,558
the russians or whatever

1436
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,440
it's actually the concatenation the mix

1437
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,720
of them all

1438
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,240
and that's what i think is so valuable

1439
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,200
about this because it is a generalized

1440
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,038
conference

1441
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,919
it allows us to see how all these

1442
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,920
problems combine

1443
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,839
in washington we don't have enough

1444
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,839
exposure to what's happening
