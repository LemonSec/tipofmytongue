including partners in the asia-pacific

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,640
region and late in america

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,160
european defense will need to be linked

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,639
to the world

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,320
globsic european security initiative is

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,639
our flagship initiative

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,160
that aims to critically analyze the

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,960
current state of development

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,119
of european defense capabilities and put

10

defense

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,840
in light of this context what is a

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,240
feasible and desirable

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,439
level of ambition of european defense

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,359
integration

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,120
what measures can be taken to deliver

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
tangible results

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,718
we offer answers to these questions and

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,719
much more

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,800

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,560

greater european strategic autonomy as

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,000
the panel is called since we only have

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,400
45 minutes for a

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,880
highly important and interesting topic

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,040
and really a high class panel let's

34
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,960
zoom right into it i'll do a quick round

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,240
of introduction my name is kai kustner

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,880

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,079
afghanistan from south asia and also

40

spent five years for aid in brussels

41
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,399
where i

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,320
first hand experienced the eu effort to

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
come to terms with the russian

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,158

trump election

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,039
all of which were probably the main

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,920
triggers for a push for

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,680
greater european strategic autonomy

51
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,119

means

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,599
you're presiding over the chiefs of

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,360

which has an opt-out on eu defense who

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,319
does not participate in pesco so that

84
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,000
should be an interesting topic i think

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,000
and last but not least

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,920

among many other things as your twitter

91
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,679
account

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,519
tells us carl bild used to be the prime

93
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,720
minister of sweden from

94
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,879

95
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,879
years until 2014

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,560
so thank you all for joining us

97
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,319
from my side let me start with the

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,040
question i would like

99
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,958
to ask to all of you so we have a little

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,239
bit of a solid base for our discussion

101
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,720
there seems to be

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,519
a lot of confusion what strategic

103
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,079
autonomy

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,918
for europe actually means is it about

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,199
common defense projects

106
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,359
is it about a standing eu army

107
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,360
is it about protecting eastern europe

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,000
against possible threats from russia one

109
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,199
day

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,320
which has been a nato domain so far um

111
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,639
why don't you define the term for us

112
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,639
and maybe let me start with mr build

113
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,000
well strategic economy is one of these

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,400
the buzzwords in

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
in in brussels that i think is to some

116
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,080
extent

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,240
best left not defined um

118
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,680
we have strategic economy uh there are

119
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,120
things that we can do on our own there

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,639
are no questions about that there are

121
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,759
quite a number of things that

122
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,520
we don't have the ability to do notably

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,520
sort of territorial defense in the east

124
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,120
nucleations

125
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,599
large-scale high-end kinetic war

126
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
that is beyond our capabilities but

127
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
there are quite a number of other

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,039
contingencies where we do have the

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,919
capability in different respects

130
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,919
where but in my opinion we are somewhat

131
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,719
reluctant to use the possibilities

132
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,719
we have and then there is of course the

133
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,000
intention to

134
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,639
gradually broaden the area of questions

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and continuously where we have the

136
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,639
ability to operate

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
european without american support that

138
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
is

139
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,400
thank you mr bill mr graziano would you

140
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,479
like to

141
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,479
go

142
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,840
thank you and i salute the other

143
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,560
panelists

144
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,638
and uh i am just backed by berlin anyway

145
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,639
when i was attending the

146
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
ministerial defense ministerial

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,759
yesterday and this morning

148
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,440
and we discussed also this issue

149
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,400
now strategic autonomy it's

150
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,400
i would say is something very important

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,758
very strategic for the

152
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,520
european uh defense construction

153
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,720
it's a critical element is a fundamental

154
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,680
element

155
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,960
some time has generated some

156
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,039
misconfusion or misperception

157
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:31,359
but is something really really important

158
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,318
image the ability to act the operational

159
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
part

160
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
and of course also the development of

161
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,080
the

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
any european defense we saw an

163
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,318
industrial part

164
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,039
but i would have i would like to say at

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,240
the beginning that strategic autonomy

166
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,440
means the ability

167
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:56,000
not to act alone or

168
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:59,280
without something but to do something

169
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,319
with partners when it's possible

170
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,359
or alone when when it is necessary or

171
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,360
required

172
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,639
or appropriate if you want uh

173
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,880
if the others nato

174
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,160
the other organization are not

175
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,080
interested or

176
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,240
not appropriate to operate in this

177
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,479
context and in this moment

178
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,800
is absolutely mandatory to

179
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,758
to reach this kind of level of strategic

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,880
autonomy

181
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,280
if europe doesn't want to fail

182
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,479
in the construction of this global

183
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,880
strategy

184
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,400
and in becoming in the security global

185
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,599
security provider

186
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,599
and be more proactive in this world with

187
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,120
all the challenges that we had

188
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,639
even before the kobe 19 it was already

189
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,199
putting us take the security of europe

190
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,360
and also because one thing that the

191
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,599
european union has realized

192
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,280
i have also been a net officer yesterday

193
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,199
before becoming the chairman of european

194
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,239
union so i know very well

195
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,479
also the nato environment but one thing

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,919
that europe has understood

197
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,719
and that there is probably no military

198
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,680
solution

199
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,520
to the crisis but there are no solutions

200
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,120
without the military

201
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,240
so the military component even as a

202
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
deterrence

203
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
is a key element for the solution of all

204
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,639
the crisis

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,240
and the ability to use also the hard

206
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,840
power it's

207
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,880
an element of the policy as an element

208
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,478
of cldp missions and operation and the

209
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,279
strategic autonomy

210
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,880
in the moment doesn't mean that we are

211
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,799
reaching the full autonomy to do

212
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,559
everything but to do what is

213
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,399
in the level ambition of the european

214
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,560
union and to create and to make stronger

215
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,200
the european defense at the industrial

216
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,839
base is also something is reinforcing

217
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,320
nato

218
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,080
and the other elements because that

219
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,680
makes that mean that we are also more

220
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,160
credible with partners

221
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,399
and we make when we make cooperation

222
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,480
it's a credible cooperation

223
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,480
uh the element the important element the

224
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,480
definition of terrible ambition and so

225
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,640
the will of the member states

226
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
to act to break down from us and one of

227
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,560
my

228
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,720
duties that i feel the most important

229
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,920
system the highest ranking but also the

230
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,640
oldest

231
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,079
in european union is to mobilize the

232
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,720
sense of urgency

233
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,640
of european country to fulfill the

234
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
larger political level ambition that has

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,680
been decided with concrete action

236
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,959
in the two different parts of the

237
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,040
strategic autonomies

238
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,319
the dark operations csdp operation and

239
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,199
on the other side

240
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,040
in the building of the industrial

241
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,080
capability and the

242
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,199
um outdoor reduced autonomy that

243
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,120
is the capability part that if you want

244
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,080
the part that makes european unions a

245
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,080
pillar for nato

246
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,480
i think you raised a very important

247
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,480
topic with the industrial base let me

248
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,360
first ask madame luazu

249
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,839
how do you define strategic autonomy for

250
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,480
europe

251
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,600
i think that strategic autonomy is the

252
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,360
way for europe

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,800
to be a relevant geopolitical actor

254
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,399
uh we have praised ourselves from being

255
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,920
the ultimate soft power

256
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,880
for decades but the world has not become

257
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,319
a safer place in recent times and what

258
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,439
we have been through with

259
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,959
uh the pandemic is

260
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,440
measuring the level of our dependency

261
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,800
not only a military dependency but

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,399
dependency towards

263
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,319
others on a number of key issues for the

264
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,720
european union

265
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
general graziano referred to the

266
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
definition of the

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,760
strategic autonomy which is included in

268
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,200
the global strategy of 2016

269
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,160
that is to act with our partners and

270
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,360
allies

271
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,959
every time we can but to be able to

272
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,160
decide and act on our own

273
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,439
every time we have to we might have

274
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,000
different uh strategic priorities with

275
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,600
other members of nato for instance which

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,320
doesn't mean that we want to

277
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,920
weaken nato but some of us are not

278
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,399
members of nato

279
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,279
and sometimes nato is not either

280
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,800
interested

281
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,480
or well equipped to address

282
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,359
or strategic priorities so strategic

283
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,560
astronomy is something that we have to

284
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,200
develop and you may remember that uh

285
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,160
the last time the european parliament

286
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,079
voted the

287
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,319
csdp report in the plenary

288
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,199
the notion of strategic autonomy was

289
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
mentioned

290
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,399
not less than 15 times in the report

291
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,600
which doesn't mean it's easy to define

292
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
it in details

293
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,440
and it is probably part of the work that

294
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,920
will be done

295
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,360
through the strategic compass that we

296
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,399
are going through right now

297
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,000
but there is no doubt that we are facing

298
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,160
a number of challenges

299
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,560
threats uh which are more uh

300
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
diverse than what they used to be in

301
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,119
which we have to be

302
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,800
relevant even being a relevant

303
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,800
european partner in nato

304
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,760
okay and last but not least mr battles

305
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,680
oh i'll try to uh highlight the

306
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,000
highlighting by by raising two questions

307
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,040
whose uh strategic autonomy are we

308
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
talking about

309
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,319
the european union but then let's call

310
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
it the european union

311
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,639
strategic autonomy and let's not call it

312
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,279
the european strategic autonomy for the

313
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,920
very simple reasons as was mentioned by

314
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,040
madonna uh there are a number of nations

315
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
which are not members of the european

316
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,480
union

317
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,000
and vice versa when we talk about nato

318
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
and the key player here is of course

319
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,240
united kingdom as one of the two

320
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,600
european nuclear nations

321
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,200
uh nuclear powers um so

322
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,399
i think the first step is to find out

323
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,680
who are we talking about

324
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,160
the second step is with what there is of

325
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,839
course

326
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,920
the difference between the political

327
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,519
level and the military level

328
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,519
and i would like to concentrate on the

329
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,880
military level the military level is

330
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,839
very simple

331
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,279
if we do not have a common military

332
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,399
strategy

333
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,800
if we do not have a command structure

334
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,519
either borrowing it from nato or having

335
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,199
our own

336
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,920
or using expanded national capabilities

337
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,399
on that and if we do not have the troops

338
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,719
which

339
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,720
are capable of working together and have

340
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,040
a minimum of standardization from an

341
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,079
industrial and logistic perspective

342
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,680
it would be very difficult and i would

343
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,719
like to warn a bit

344
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,519
as mr carl built alluded to

345
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,959
maybe not with the same purpose as me i

346
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,120
would like to warn a bit

347
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,040
against the rhetoric and look at the

348
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,040
nuts and bolts of the realities

349
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,399
okay thank you you you also um

350
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,480
raised the issue is uh great britain

351
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,440
going to be part of a

352
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,360
security agenda or not uh let's also i

353
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,160
think we can't leave out the us

354
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,480
out of the picture here in the end it

355
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,760
was

356
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,600
doubts about u.s reliability which was

357
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,319
one of the main reasons for calls for

358
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,720
strategic autonomy and

359
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,040
president trump is actually i would say

360
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,120
in the process of tearing apart the

361
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,199
security architecture the u.s built

362
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,720
after 1945. so

363
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:40,560
my question to you all of you would be

364
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,680
is europe capable of filling the void

365
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,079
militarily at all if the u.s withdraws

366
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
and how

367
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,680
much should the u.s withdraw i know that

368
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,199
germany

369
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:55,599
always says we can only

370
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:58,880
be in well european

371
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,519
sovereignty can only be an add-on to

372
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,839
u.s alignment we can't leave the us out

373
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,399
of the picture other european countries

374
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,079
are little more straight forward so how

375
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,240
would you

376
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,760
define it on that term and how should we

377
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,639
deal with the u.s in this respect

378
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,160
well i guess thought i mean there are

379
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,320
clearly contingencies that we can't

380
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,639
handle without the us

381
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,480
if we take sort of high-end territorial

382
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
defense in the east of europe versus a

383
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,279
large-scale russian aggression

384
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,079
which i think is somewhat unlikely

385
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,480
but if you go to lithuanian poland it's

386
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,399
uppermost in their mind can't be done

387
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,480
without the us can we

388
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,320
we are in order to be able to do it

389
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,000
together well there have been a couple

390
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,920
of studies done in the last few years

391
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,600
and and and it's doable but we are

392
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,319
talking about decades

393
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,320
and uh very very substantial increases

394
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,680
in defense spending all across

395
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,000
likely well less likely i would say

396
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,239
and that still leaves out the big

397
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,600
nuclear component with due respect

398
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,600
to uh the french but there are quite a

399
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,399
number of other things that that

400
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,240
that we can do but i remember from my

401
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
time when i was attending the concert

402
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,000
there was always a reluctance

403
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,079
by the the governments to use military

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,560
power

405
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,399
i think the last operation on land that

406
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,920
we did as an eu

407
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,480
was in charred in 2007. uh since then

408
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,040
every

409
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,399
proposal to you sort of more that that's

410
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,199
that's been the largest

411
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,440
one we've done uh everything else has

412
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,639
been smaller and trading

413
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,880
and uh when confronted with uh for

414
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,240
example the situation in sahel

415
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,639
uh we rely on sort of ad-hoc coalitions

416
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,720
and we rely on the u.n and others

417
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,160
but there's been a distinct reluctance

418
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,519
in brussels

419
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,959
to actually use military power uh we got

420
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,399
the battle groups uh

421
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,000
paris even have the european

422
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,360
intervention initiative which includes

423
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
the uk which is a quarter of the

424
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,160
military force in europe

425
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,480
uh but that hasn't been used either

426
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,918
so i i think it's fine that the european

427
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,880
parliament speaks about strategic

428
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,520
autonomy

429
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,679
but we still have a situation where the

430
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,000
governments in the council

431
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,280
are extremely reluctant even in

432
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,319
contingencies where it should be

433
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,399
possible

434
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,399
uh to use military power

435
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,360
would anyone want to answer that yeah

436
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,840
i i share a number of things that carl

437
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,960
bill just said

438
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,360
um there are obviously uh issues on

439
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
which we depend on the united states and

440
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,840
there is no

441
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,480
uh will and no way to replace the united

442
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,799
states

443
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,160
but the question mark is whether the

444
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,879
united states

445
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,400
remains as interested as it was in the

446
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,679
in the past

447
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,640
in the security of europe and it is not

448
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,000
completely related to one specific

449
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:05,840
president of the united states

450
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,520
with president obama already

451
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:13,120
the notion of privating to asia

452
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,000
was a key of the way the united states

453
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,120
was viewing its

454
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,480
own strategic priorities and in

455
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,159
a conflict like syria we vividly

456
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,919
remembered

457
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,880
that at the end of the day in 2013

458
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,559
when a red line was crossed uh the

459
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,600
united states decided

460
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,240
not to act and we were not able to act

461
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
on

462
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,760
on our own uh and the european union and

463
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,918
europe as a whole

464
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,600
lives with the consequences of the

465
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,799
syrian conflict

466
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,760
without having uh the capacity to act

467
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,039
kalbit is is right in mentioning the

468
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,440
reluctance

469
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,559
of member states uh sometimes they

470
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,679
decide on

471
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,879
a military operations and missions on

472
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,960
paper

473
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
and they turn them back at the moment

474
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,039
where they have to provide

475
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,880
staffing and equipment for this

476
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,559
operations and missions

477
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,200
and we are more timid more shy than what

478
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,360
we were

479
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:19,039
uh in the early uh uh 27

480
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,760
2007 as you mentioned uh we have become

481
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,520
more reluctant at the moment where the

482
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,200
our neighborhood

483
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,840
is less stable we will probably discuss

484
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,160
the

485
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,840
situation in the mediterranean and i'm

486
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,200
not talking only about eastern

487
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,559
mediterranean

488
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,280
but the situation if you see syria

489
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,960
lebanon

490
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,240
libya is a situation where our security

491
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,640
is at stake

492
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,320
and there is very little interest from

493
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,080
the united states

494
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,280
to uh get into this situation

495
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,159
uh and to uh provide with military

496
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,440
support

497
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,320
so what do we do do we blame the us

498
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,039
do we complain about the situation or uh

499
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,158
do we

500
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,600
realize that we have to be uh able to

501
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,720
act autonomously

502
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,158
you also mentioned sahel and thank you

503
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,559
for mentioning it because

504
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,440
my home country is of course very much

505
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,080
involved

506
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,240
in the security of sahel with some

507
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,039
difficulties and some

508
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,360
successful there are european missions

509
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,960
but there are uh

510
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,600
light footprint missions uh there is the

511
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,320
u.n

512
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,760
uh but we know that we still depend on

513
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,678
the united states

514
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,120
and we still have question marks whether

515
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,720
the united states will

516
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,879
continue helping us in the sahel and

517
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,880
i can understand why seen from

518
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,960
washington this is not a priority

519
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,840
but seen from europe this is obviously a

520
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,440
security

521
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,678
challenge yes

522
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,000
now yeah since you if i may just

523
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,000
mentioned

524
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,640
yeah please go ahead i'll give you the

525
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,080
floor directly

526
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,200
yes thank you and also taking uh

527
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,600
not what general barter said

528
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,520
uh we have to be clear that uh

529
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,120
absolutely there is no competition

530
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,240
between the european union

531
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,520
and net of course collective defense it

532
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,000
belongs to nato and in all the meeting

533
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,200
we make is always about

534
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,120
increasing cooperation with nato but in

535
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,400
this moment we have to be concrete that

536
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,199
it was said

537
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,919
and sometimes this cooperation this

538
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,120
tactical and operational cooperation

539
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,159
uh is a little bit more difficult than

540
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,000
in the past for many reasons and there

541
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,200
are new challenges that are coming from

542
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,760
the south i'm just

543
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,240
speaking about libya to make an example

544
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,879
on this mediterranean

545
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,600
in which nato in this moment is not in

546
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,360
condition

547
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,600
or in the will to uh to act

548
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,520
and of course we are not thinking about

549
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,559
the european defense without united

550
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,960
states because

551
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,240
as you also it was said yesterday during

552
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,679
the meeting

553
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,799
of course if we go in operation in sahel

554
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,960
and we hope to be able to be more

555
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,679
proactive and to have an increasing

556
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,679
level ambition it will be much better

557
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,760
with the american eye star at disposal

558
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,159
it depends it's available or not

559
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,080
available so if it is not available

560
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,679
there are a level ambition or a number

561
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
of mission operations

562
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,120
which we must have this autonomous

563
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,879
ability

564
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,360
or go out of the game and i am going to

565
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,120
i am referring again to the main what is

566
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,479
the one of the main effort or main

567
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:44,000
theater that is the central media

568
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,080
and libya in which there are

569
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,840
european operations and net operation at

570
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,039
this moment there is

571
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,559
not cooperation between the two because

572
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,480
lack of agreement but this one is an

573
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,080
operation that is vital

574
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,280
for european union to enforce the

575
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,320
european united national resolution

576
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,799
and the decision taken in berlin

577
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,600
it of course it become a matter of wheel

578
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,320
of donation

579
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,399
you need a military strategy yes uh

580
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,720
since 2016 a lot

581
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,640
have been done and now there is a

582
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,320
strategic compass

583
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,480
that is going to set the threats and

584
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,879
try to have a better coordination

585
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,080
between pesco and the edf

586
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,080
is this a military structure uh yes

587
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,918
in the past when we had the possibility

588
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,720
to use belly plus

589
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,600
it was possible to make use of the nato

590
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,159
common

591
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,480
the nato command structure to run a

592
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,640
european operation this moment

593
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,200
for different reasons is not possible so

594
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,559
there is no alternative to build

595
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,440
a an european

596
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,080
ability to run operations that is also

597
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,360
be

598
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:01,760
a true leading nation

599
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,080
like ataranta that is an entire quarter

600
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,520
spanish headquarters it's an italian

601
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,000
quarter and

602
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,639
for example in bordeaux the golovina is

603
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
still nato because it's under belly plus

604
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,400
but an a a planning and conduct

605
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,039
capability is needed

606
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,799
of course in the best world we could do

607
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,720
much better in cooperation with that

608
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,240
organization but that's the reality in

609
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,200
this moment if we have to face the

610
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,520
reality

611
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,120
we have to face that the geostrategic

612
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,520
situation in

613
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,760
mediterranea for example exchange a lot

614
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,440
there are many

615
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,320
crisis arrow crises along different

616
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,320
place in the world and along the sea and

617
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,600
in some ways the world is much closer to

618
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,080
european union

619
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,120
after that clearly is a difficult moment

620
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,158
because in this moment

621
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,639
it's difficult to have any uh

622
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,360
agreement also in the security council

623
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,240
of

624
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:00,799
the united nations and in this moment

625
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,360
nato is withdrawing from other places

626
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,960
and is

627
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,479
more concentrated on the collective

628
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,320
defense and

629
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,200
a building of a better european union

630
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,879
more autonomous capabilities and the

631
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,520
building with the edf

632
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,480
and the other means of better european

633
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,720
forces means

634
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,720
helping nato because there is as a

635
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,159
matter of fact

636
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,159
your nato is the most important

637
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,880
military alliance in the world united

638
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,880
nations the european union is a

639
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,720
international organization that has also

640
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,159
the ability to put funds

641
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,400
and to finance the the development so we

642
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,200
have

643
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,840
european defense fund we have european

644
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,279
peace facility we have recovery found

645
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,039
that our with the way to support

646
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,240
these initiatives of course the

647
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,240
cooperation will be united

648
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,559
mr graziano sorry um we'll come to the

649
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,080
defense fund as well

650
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,240
but since you all mentioned the

651
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,439
mediterranean let me ask a provocative

652
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,440
question

653
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,360
there is the this current escalation

654
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,240
between greece and turkey

655
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,199
for the moment so you have one eu and

656
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,559
nato country

657
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,200
greece doing maneuvers with france

658
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,360
your country madame luazu and another

659
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,360
nato country turkey doing a maneuver

660
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,399
with the u.s well a third

661
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,520
eu nation germany is trying to negotiate

662
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,360
peace

663
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,600
to be a bit provocative isn't that

664
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,840
working exactly in the wrong

665
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,439
direction doesn't that show that it's

666
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,720
very difficult with

667
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,840
strategic autonomy in europe mr butler's

668
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,799
i think you wanted to

669
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,000
yes um even though you have asked a

670
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,520
question i will very

671
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,440
quickly i will also come to that

672
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,840
question but i will start by saying

673
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,799
mr carl bill talked about uh the

674
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,120
probability

675
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,720
of high or law of a potential russian

676
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,239
aggression against baltic states and

677
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,559
poland and so on

678
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,679
and we could have an interesting

679
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,720
discussion about that

680
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,799
issue but what i would like to say

681
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,240
is that the world is full of strategic

682
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,760
surprises

683
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,600
if we look at what's going on in the

684
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,799
aegean sea and other places for the time

685
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,918
being i don't think many of us would

686
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,080
have foreseen that

687
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,679
a number of months ago even though there

688
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,000
might be signs of it

689
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,919
the issue of strategic surprises are

690
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,720
seldom the lack of information there are

691
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,960
whether

692
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,760
the minds are open to see what is going

693
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,520
to happen

694
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,320
or not and unfortunately military

695
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,279
history

696
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,559
and also ground strategy is full of

697
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,679
surprises

698
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,799
so i would be careful in discounting

699
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,520
what is called full spectrum threats uh

700
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,639
when we talk

701
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,120
about europe but otherwise

702
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,840
uh i i fully take the point of what has

703
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,639
has been said

704
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,520
and let me just say to reinforce madame

705
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,840
resource view

706
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,520
on president obama president trump is

707
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,000
not responsible for what's going on this

708
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,679
has been going on for some time

709
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,279
and may i just say that one of the

710
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,799
reasons why it's going on is because the

711
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,720
europeans do not want to carry

712
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,158
the responsibilities for their own

713
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,960
defense

714
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,120
we have limited budgets and let me say a

715
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,200
few words about the budgets

716
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,199
i would say we use a substantive

717
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,320
percentage in all the big nations in the

718
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,080
european union

719
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,279
to fund national military industries

720
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,399
at the expense of maybe at least

721
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,840
as good and cheaper common equipment so

722
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,479
we could probably make better use of

723
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,600
what we have

724
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,520
as uh funds for the time being

725
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,760
if there was a bit more rigorous

726
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,600
approach to that issue

727
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:37,279
as to the question you raised

728
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:41,439
just raised as to greece and turkey

729
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:44,559
well turkey is where turkey is

730
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,000
partly because turkey now whether

731
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,600
turkey member of the european union

732
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,440
would have made any changes

733
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,678
we do not know for evident reasons

734
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,760
whether turkey really wanted to become

735
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,120
a member of the european nation european

736
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,399
uh union

737
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,959
i do not know but what i know today is

738
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,559
that the turks feel that they have been

739
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,039
looked

740
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,000
we have been looking down at them this i

741
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,879
have experienced

742
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,240
through a number of years now and we

743
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,640
shouldn't be surprised they are where

744
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
they are

745
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,439
i think that the nations which can make

746
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,640
a difference i think the european union

747
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,440
has to play a role

748
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,640
but it has to be extraordinarily careful

749
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,360
and paris

750
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,559
berlin and athens will have to be very

751
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,879
careful and also nicosia

752
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,000
and maybe the outsider which can really

753
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,000
makes a difference

754
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,520
that's washington but probably you can

755
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,760
forget everything about that on this

756
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,440
side of three november

757
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,200
so we are facing a very difficult

758
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,760
situation and whether the chancellor

759
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,799
would be able to fill the gap

760
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,640
i don't know but this might be

761
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,000
a very bad repetition of what took place

762
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,760
in 1974

763
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
which led to the turkish intervention in

764
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,080
cyprus not that i think that anything

765
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,760
along those lines will take place

766
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,039
but it might lead to an unnecessary

767
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,399
conflict

768
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,760
between two nato allies and thereby

769
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,439
indirectly

770
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,919
a very difficult situation between the

771
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,960
european union and nato

772
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,960
and there'll be no winners

773
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,679
yes directly on that issue

774
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,520
yes i agree on the fact that the

775
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,960
situation is very tense

776
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,600
and dangerous uh i would not agree uh by

777
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,320
saying

778
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,000
that we were looking down at turkey and

779
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,039
that that's the reason for what's

780
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,919
happening

781
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:36,320
what's happening is due to a an

782
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,600
authoritarian regime

783
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,760
in ankara which distances

784
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,840
itself from our strategic priorities but

785
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,240
also often

786
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,120
the mental value and the european union

787
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,399
there is no responsibility on that

788
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,760
on the contrary the problem with turkey

789
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,039
now is that what's happening in eastern

790
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,240
mediterranean

791
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,799
is just one more episode of turkey

792
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,600
acting against the interests uh the

793
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,279
security and

794
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:12,080
rest of europe uh you could uh mention

795
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,799
uh the operation the military operation

796
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,840
of turkey

797
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,559
in eastern syria which uh

798
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,678
put obstacles to our own fight against

799
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,760
isis

800
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,760
uh you could mention what's taking place

801
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,440
in central mediterranean

802
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,480
where uh turkey does not respect the

803
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,200
arms embargo decided by the

804
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,799
united nations security council

805
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,600
regarding libya

806
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,440
there are a number of issues in which

807
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,719
our security interests

808
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,320
don't match was the security interests

809
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,200
of a member of nato and i would not go

810
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,080
back to

811
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,840
some very uh famous comments made by

812
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,240
president macron about nato

813
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,879
but i think that there is a need for

814
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,559
strategic

815
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,200
discussions within nato about what are

816
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:05,279
common threats what are

817
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,919
common attitudes pushing for peace

818
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,880
and preventing tensions and military

819
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,240
risks

820
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,120
and my position is that if we want to

821
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,720
avoid

822
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,439
more tensions and more risks we have

823
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
to uh

824
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,720
to to to to show or resolve and to

825
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,678
uh show that our sovereignty or borders

826
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,880
are something that

827
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,120
someone cannot play with otherwise

828
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,240
if you remember what president erdogan

829
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,000
said

830
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,120
yesterday he said um

831
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,600
if if you if the europeans want uh

832
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,639
to be serious they have to be ready to

833
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,840
pay a price

834
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,720
otherwise they have to let us go at some

835
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,840
point

836
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,320
we have to say this is enough

837
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,320
uh if we want a dialogue if we want

838
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,320
diplomacy to prevail

839
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,320
we have to show some strength and some

840
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:10,639
resolve

841
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:13,439
for a quick answer

842
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,279
yes very very very fast at the beginning

843
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,600
of the year also they represent they

844
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,200
said that uh

845
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,760
with the intervention of turkey in libya

846
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,840
and the activity of russia the

847
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,039
geostrategic situation is changing

848
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,720
mediterranean

849
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,720
so what's happening in the central

850
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,320
mediterranean and what is happening in

851
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,760
libya is connected

852
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,240
with raptoring in east mediterranean and

853
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,919
there is no doubt that we go back to the

854
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,120
to the need to have

855
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,480
a hard power uh to the to the need to

856
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,879
have our power even

857
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:51,919
to run negotiation and as a deterrence

858
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,480
and but we need also of course the the

859
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,679
will

860
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,320
to use sometimes even foreign

861
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,440
uh this military this military power if

862
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,399
we were able

863
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,840
to implement correctly irini uh that was

864
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,559
established in order to

865
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,960
support the berliner process and so to

866
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,000
apply the embargo decided by united

867
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,320
nations that the step

868
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,679
force is higher that would be already a

869
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,119
strong message

870
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,159
uh for european union korean defense

871
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,960
after that

872
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,280
it's a matter of uh reaching an

873
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,480
agreement and to have a european union

874
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,560
to act

875
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,480
more in a more unified way and to

876
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,159
mobilize this sense of urgency

877
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,240
and sometimes within the european

878
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,040
country of course there is disagreement

879
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,879
uh as it is difficult now in nato

880
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,079
because again there are many

881
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,319
european countries there are

882
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,240
disagreements and as i said

883
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,079
uh we would love to have a better

884
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,078
cooperation at sea for example between

885
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,040
nato european union at this moment

886
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,000
is practically impossible to address but

887
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,239
that means that there are more

888
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,520
responsibility for european union

889
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:57,839
security and defense activity to operate

890
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,720
and to become more credible because the

891
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,599
alternative

892
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,000
is the failure but that is not possible

893
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,280
because

894
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,560
the failure will be a step back over 20

895
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,320
or 30 years

896
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,599
so i am convinced i'm optimistic but

897
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,760
we have really to be more serious

898
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,680
to transform what is the political level

899
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,680
ambition that was expressed

900
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,839
by all the countries because also in the

901
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,480
crisis between uh

902
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,560
turkey and the russian cyprus the

903
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,280
eastern dorian the declaration of europe

904
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,799
is clear

905
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,560
as it is for belarus as it is for

906
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,400
libya but after that after the

907
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,440
definition of the level ambition

908
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,560
were to uh run for the activity the

909
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,200
connected uh

910
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,040
activity and that sometimes is a little

911
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,319
bit more difficult but of course rome

912
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,839
was not built

913
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,640
in few years from 2016 a lot has been

914
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,119
done

915
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,000
we have also to remember that the

916
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,720
operation

917
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,880
that we had the greatest operation

918
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,160
against terrorism in iraq were run by a

919
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,400
coalition of willing

920
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,160
probably 10 or 15 years ago would have

921
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,960
been run by nato

922
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,720
but i mean this one is a timing which

923
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,480
the international organization probably

924
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,240
has to readjust

925
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,599
to a new world what we haven't

926
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,160
talked about yet is uh let me just bring

927
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,320
in

928
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,560
bring in the audience at this point mr

929
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,119
bill i will give you a chance to

930
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,320
uh answer then as well what we haven't

931
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,359
talked about yet is

932
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,599
pesco the so-called sleeping beauty of

933
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,160
eu defense and the european defense fund

934
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,680
which i think is very important but

935
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,720
right now i would

936
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,118
try to bring in other participants maybe

937
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,399
their questions will focus on that also

938
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,880
so i would like

939
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,560
to raise questions from from the

940
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,560
audience please for this moment

941
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,319
here it comes yes hello my name is tony

942
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,880
von the tour from the

943
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,880
klingon doll institute in the hague uh i

944
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,160
have indeed a question about

945
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,520
the defense fund um i have noticed the

946
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,399
european ambition uh on in the field of

947
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
strategic

948
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,440
econ autonomy uh

949
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,119
the commission presenting itself as a

950
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,640
geopolitical commission

951
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,640
but when you look at the budget

952
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,720
negotiations on the multi-annual

953
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,720
financial framework you see that the

954
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,680
budget for defense has

955
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,439
been decreased enormously when you

956
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,879
compare it to the

957
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,040
original figures so how credible is this

958
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,200
european defense still

959
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,480
if we look at the the threats and

960
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,680
challenges which

961
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,680
which we are facing uh not only in in

962
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:46,720
the south but also in the east of

963
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:48,960
europe yeah

964
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,160
if i want i can say my my opinion of

965
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,040
course at the beginning

966
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,520
european defense funds were 13 billion

967
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,040
now is seven billion in seven years

968
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,359
uh it's the first time we have seven

969
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,800
billion so you can see the the glass

970
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,440
uh half empty of our full i would love

971
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,760
to go back

972
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,599
at least to 13 billion i want also to

973
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,640
remember that european defense funds

974
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,079
are only for resulting the development

975
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,560
up to the acquisition of the fourth

976
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,240
prototype so it's in order to

977
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:21,119
build a stronger uh european industry

978
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,399
and to support this capability that is

979
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,000
extremely important

980
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,800
now the the the real priority for us

981
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,040
is that the pandemic the the coping is

982
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,480
not going to affect

983
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,960
the defense budget that would amper

984
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,680
development that that can be done only

985
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,079
if the

986
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,960
european union learn how to act better

987
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,040
together

988
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,880
and to make projects that are also

989
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,759
european projects that could

990
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,520
protect this one that doesn't mean to

991
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,640
make it alone because many things will

992
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,880
remain will

993
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,879
will be done with united states with

994
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,400
others and i know united states is also

995
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,599
very interested in pesco

996
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,960
and edf in the other cities through the

997
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,160
strategies the

998
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,480
the the new strategic complex

999
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,759
we hope to put together all these kind

1000
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,240
of things to make

1001
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,320
it more effective for the first time we

1002
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,520
also have epf european peace

1003
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,280
facility uh towards the operation

1004
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,640
the real problem that this one is a

1005
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,920
crucial here

1006
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,560
but for all these uh new

1007
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,240
uh procedures and for the operation is

1008
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,560
also the year in which we are fighting

1009
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,439
with the combat 19 so it's

1010
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,520
really a challenging time but compared

1011
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,240
to the past we did a lot i also remember

1012
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,880
that

1013
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,520
through the recovery found there are

1014
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,920
also

1015
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,720
initiatives that are eligible in the

1016
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,359
arena of

1017
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,640
security and defense like cyber

1018
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,880
visualization and

1019
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,160
resilience so it again is also the

1020
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,800
matter of the

1021
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,759
of the will of the member states is not

1022
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,960
a lot

1023
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,079
but is the largest things ever done by

1024
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,760
international organizations

1025
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,760
to support the defense and security

1026
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,160
could i just come in and say that the

1027
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,440
edf and peskov was good things

1028
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,680
but we will only know sort of 10 years

1029
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,760
down the road

1030
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,680
what capability increases they have

1031
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,480
resulted in that we would not have had

1032
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,118
otherwise so it's going to take quite

1033
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,040
some time

1034
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,319
i hope maximum effort is going to go

1035
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,520
into them uh

1036
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,279
they are going to be sort of

1037
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,200
supplementary funding to the funding

1038
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,079
that is going to be in the respective

1039
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,839
national defense budgets but then we

1040
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,040
come back to the question of

1041
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,880
building the capabilities over the years

1042
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,040
and then the political willingness

1043
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,319
actually used these capabilities in a

1044
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,279
credible way

1045
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,079
in the concrete contingencies and and i

1046
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,319
think

1047
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,240
far too much of the discussion is about

1048
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,400
sort of more theoretical concepts

1049
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,439
and bureaucratic mechanisms for money in

1050
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,079
brussels

1051
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,839
and far too little on actually

1052
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,400
operational contingencies

1053
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,240
and willingness to use also hard power

1054
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,640
to support the strategic ambitions that

1055
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,640
we have

1056
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,319
i would like to support what mr carl

1057
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,319
bill has just been saying

1058
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,319
on this issue because

1059
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,160
we are wasting money in europe on our

1060
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,439
defenses as

1061
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,560
i mentioned earlier on as to equipment

1062
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,440
the only two real future programs which

1063
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,240
i was

1064
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,880
really concentrating on are the future

1065
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,359
french

1066
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,000
german combat aircraft and the future

1067
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,119
german

1068
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,599
french main battle time if that can

1069
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,240
become

1070
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,880
a european solution to some of the big

1071
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,359
investments

1072
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,960
in various armed forces we will have a

1073
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,759
real way ahead

1074
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,560
until further notice we are using a lot

1075
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,680
of money

1076
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,520
on nationalizing our own equipment and

1077
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,040
making it impossible for small nations

1078
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,280
such as the one i come from

1079
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,960
to have any influence or any hope to get

1080
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,640
anything at a decent price

1081
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,400
why do you think the f-35 has been

1082
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,160
bought by a number of european nations

1083
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,240
because the europeans the big nations

1084
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,799
have not delivered it's as simple as

1085
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
that

1086
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,480
and we should not forget the nuts and

1087
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,399
bolts there is too much rhetoric

1088
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,760
and not enough facts sorry just

1089
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,480
to make a specification for edf

1090
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,160
you need at least three countries with

1091
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,040
three different entities

1092
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,200
so two counts are not enough and the two

1093
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,400
project for sure the main battle tank at

1094
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,480
the future

1095
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,839
uh iron combat system is going to be

1096
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,800
part of edf

1097
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,759
but i don't know in which one of the in

1098
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,000
which

1099
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,520
in which forum in which combination

1100
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,160
there is also big difference between

1101
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,359
pesco

1102
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,560
and df edf is only the results and

1103
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,119
development

1104
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,359
uh pesco is capability the development

1105
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,839
so it's for immediate operation

1106
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,839
and can be done uh in a different manner

1107
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,040
is financed by the member state

1108
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,078
can be financed by european union if

1109
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,440
they are also

1110
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:06,240
edf projects so everything is pushing on

1111
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,000
the possibility to have edf supporting

1112
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,078
another important thing is i don't want

1113
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,839
to run the job back for your

1114
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,960
commission breton the fact that

1115
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,359
one of the specific point edf is that

1116
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,400
the all the counter be have to be

1117
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,839
involved

1118
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,560
so there is to be uh this spread your

1119
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,599
change and

1120
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,759
a large part is dedicated for medium

1121
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,720
and small enterprise the idea is to

1122
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,839
change the way of

1123
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,919
the run the project actually nobody can

1124
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,040
make the the project and being the

1125
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,440
leading nation

1126
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,319
and having the european fund the idea

1127
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,240
that

1128
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,560
all the countries to participate with

1129
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,799
the project and to find this agreement

1130
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,160
and this support is probably difficult a

1131
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,680
required time

1132
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:56,240
sometimes it's easier to go outside

1133
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,799
to make a expenses but again

1134
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,078
europe was able to put 750 million in

1135
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,560
the recovery fund nobody

1136
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,440
else can do something like that and also

1137
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,680
with ddf

1138
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,720
is the first that makes this tentative

1139
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,520
at least

1140
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,279
it's an advantage we have to take

1141
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,880
possibility of disadvantage after that

1142
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,599
against the usual is up to the member

1143
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,200
state

1144
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:20,800
but as a military my uh

1145
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,759
my duty is to provide an unfettered and

1146
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,280
honest advice and with my rank i'm a

1147
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,599
hedge i must do it

1148
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,319
and to say don't waste this opportunity

1149
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,440
because

1150
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,800
our nation may be with kobe are a little

1151
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,640
bit more fragile

1152
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,880
with the support of europe they can be

1153
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,240
much stronger and commits could be

1154
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,480
something that help to build the future

1155
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,359
this is the first time i heard the word

1156
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,160
comet

1157
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:48,960
just very quickly madame luazu to sum it

1158
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,440
up because we are running out of time

1159
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,800
i would simply mention that as a general

1160
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,839
graziano i would see

1161
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,880
the uh the glass half full on edf it's

1162
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,279
the first

1163
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,440
uh maybe we would like to have more

1164
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,599
money on edf but it's a first it's a

1165
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,520
start and it's a good start

1166
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,040
i'm more concerned about national

1167
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,800
defense budget

1168
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,720
we were lagging behind a number of

1169
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,160
member states were lagging behind

1170
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,279
even before the pandemic and now i've

1171
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,480
i'm even more concerned about two

1172
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,440
narrow defense budgets uh and for once i

1173
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,839
would agree with

1174
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,480
donald trump that we are not doing

1175
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,599
enough

1176
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,599
for our national defense efforts and i'm

1177
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,000
somewhat concerned with pasco i have to

1178
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,640
say i'm concerned that it becomes

1179
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,920
bureaucracy and processes as brussels is

1180
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,319
so good at

1181
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,839
more than something ambitious uh at the

1182
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,759
beginning we wanted to have something

1183
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,160
ambitious and inclusive

1184
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,400
it became extremely inclusive i'm not

1185
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,879
sure it's sufficiently ambitious

1186
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,319
and we have to have a clear oversight

1187
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,000
about what's taking place

1188
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,000
and i do regret that the european

1189
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,079
parliament

1190
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,720
doesn't offer a say in what's taking

1191
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,560
place on pesco
