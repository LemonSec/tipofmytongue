1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
blacksmith shop one day a stranger came

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,720
with an offer

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,839
i will give you blacksmith a bag full of

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,200
gold coins

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,599
for a special task on one condition

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,518
never talk to anyone about it the

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,759
blacksmith agreed

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,279
the stranger gave him a huge slab of

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
gold and asked him

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,640
to make a horseshoe with that gold

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,640
then they went into high mountains and

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
deep into a cave

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,960
the blacksmith could not believe his

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,640
eyes there was an army of knights

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,360
sleeping in full armor who are they

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,680
the stranger replied those warriors had

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,640
been

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,160
in deep sleep for hundreds of years they

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,800
will only wake up

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
if it is time to fight a real great

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,718
battle

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,640
for the country the stranger told the

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
blacksmith to change the horseshoe

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,920
of one of the horses when the job was

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,039
done

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,719
he paid what was promised the blacksmith

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,280
went back to his shop

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,320
and of course he was not able to keep

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,280
his word

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,200
he told his wife and friends and then

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,240
his bag full of gold coins

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,159
turned into sand the blacksmith tried to

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,280
return to that cave but he was never

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,439
able to find it again

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,119
but simple and banal story has some

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,199
morals that i quite

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,840
that i find quite relevant for the

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,799
transatlantic alliance today

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,119
first military preparedness is not a

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,799
luxury we can live without

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,400
we need to be ready for any eventuality

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,880
whether we talk about military

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,680
expenditure in european countries

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,240
or american soldiers stationed in europe

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,119
we need

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
every single euro cent and every single

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,479
pair

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,720
of military boots on the ground even if

49
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,240
the prospect of open military conflict

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,720
is distant second

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,560
in relations across the pond we need to

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,798
keep our promises

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,000
hold on to the goodwill established

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,560
between allies

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
after 1945. trade

relations with china and russia peace in

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
the middle east

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,799
we all need a common strategy for these

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,280
issues

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,920
for the whole transatlantic alliance

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,239
unless

64
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,200
we want to be outvoted and outpaced by

65
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,400
the outside world it is as simple

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,440
as that the legend of a sleeping knights

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,840
is just a legend

68
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,720
a fictitious account do we really want

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
the alliance

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
of liberal democracies turn into a

71
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,839
legend a fiction

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,840
invented story as well

minutes we're going to cover some of the

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,520
key issues that concern what is going on

112
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,960
in belarus because the entire world is

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,520
watching that right now

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,080
you've described belarus as being in the

115
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,758
midst

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,599
of a revolution reluctantly perhaps

117
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,040
you've become the de facto leader of

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,560
that revolution

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
millions of people are looking to you

120
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,880
for guidance tens of thousands

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,639
are marching in the streets striking a

122
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,719
great personal risk

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
first of all how do you feel about that

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,199
uh you know on the one hand

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,800
i'm really worried about what's going on

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,240
in belarus because

127
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,960
uh you know our authorities

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,960
as usual

129
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,080
threaten and intimidate our people

130
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,679
and they put people in jail just for

131
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,800
they desire to express

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,720
their opinion but on the other hand

133
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,000
i'm really proud of my people

134
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,440
who at last woke up and they

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,600
stepped over all the fears they had for

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,120
26 years and found a strength to

137
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,039
fight for their rights

138
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,639
now you let's get straight into the

139
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,560
heart of this you reject

140
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,000
the results of your country's

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,360
presidential election

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,400
and you're demanding a new election

143
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
uh one that's free and fair how

144
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,239
realistic

145
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,240
do you think that is

146
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:06,240
it is realistic because it's a will

147
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,758
and desire of the whole nation uh

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,960
the previous elections were not fair uh

149
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,160
no transparent

150
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,880
so we will have never

151
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,600
uh know the real results of it but

152
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,000
what we have seen after the elections we

153
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,039
have seen the wheel of people who went

154
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,039
out to defend

155
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:34,800
their voices so and all those people

156
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:38,080
all the nation uh want to

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,720
have this new and transparent election

158
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,560
during after which they uh during which

159
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,319
they will be able to choose

160
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,720
a new president for our country

161
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,560
well you certainly have a large number

162
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,840
of people out on the streets who are

163
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,639
asking for that but so far mr

164
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
lukashenko has given no indication that

165
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,160
he's willing to

166
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,719
step back and clear the way for

167
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,800
independently monitor elections that

168
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
adhere to any international standards do

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,960
you believe the protests

170
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,280
will be enough to make him change his

171
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
mind

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,880
i have to admit that there is no

173
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,560
indication

174
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,599
that belarus and people will step away

175
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,720
as well

176
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,319
so just

177
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,599
you know oblivious and people have

178
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,080
changed and

179
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,919
they will know they will not step away

180
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,440
in any case because they will not be

181
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,639
able to live with this

182
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,080
president anymore they will not be

183
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,240
able to obey him anymore and trust him

184
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
anymore and moreover they will not be

185
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,800
able to

186
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:52,479
forgive and forget all the violence that

187
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,560
our authorities has have committed

188
00:07:52,479 --> 00:08:00,080
after the elections so this is the view

189
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,680
of our nation to have new elections and

190
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,719
they will stand until the victory

191
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,319
okay that's the the will of

192
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,440
the nation as you see it but again

193
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,280
right now there's a standoff between

194
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,240
the people who are out on the streets

195
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,799
and president lukashenko who is refusing

196
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,319
to budge uh let me put it another way

197
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,039
what do you see as the

198
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,680
as the prerequisites for you to achieve

199
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,360
your goal

200
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
of free and fair elections in battle

201
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
routes

202
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,880
so the first demand of of the nation is

203
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,240
that mr lukashenka had to step away

204
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,320
one more demand is that all their

205
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,920
political prisoners have to be

206
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,360
released from the jails just they

207
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,439
are there just because they wanted to

208
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,880
to say what they think openly and

209
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
the next step is a new election

210
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,320
themselves

211
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,839
itself where we are going to choose new

212
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
president for our country

213
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,279
now okay so you you're you're demanding

214
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,120
the release of all political prisoners

215
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,560
you're demanding fresh elections uh

216
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,320
right now we're at it

217
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,800
at an impasse and many people are

218
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,360
looking to other

219
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,920
to places outside of belarus and to see

220
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,320
what role

221
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,000
they're playing in it you've said that

222
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,080
what's happening in your country is not

223
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,959
a geopolitical revolution that it's

224
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
neither

225
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,040
pro eu it's nor pro

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
russian but belarus does not exist in a

227
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,480
political

228
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,920
vacuum both russia and the eu have a

229
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
massive interest in your country's

230
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,719
future don't they

231
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:56,160
of course they are interested but you

232
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:59,599
know what's important now in belarus is

233
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,120
our people and they will to

234
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,440
build new country for ourselves and

235
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,920
i'm sure that and so we are asking for

236
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,600
we are asking for respecting of the

237
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,319
serenity of our country

238
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,839
and uh just let our people to

239
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,360
determine their future the way to uh

240
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,360
to move by themselves

241
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,600
belarus is considered by some to be part

242
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,959
of europe but it also has very

243
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,839
deep close ties to russia of course

244
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,560
uh do you have equal confidence in

245
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,680
russia

246
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:47,680
and the eu to respect belarus's right

247
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:50,800
to self-determination

248
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,719
uh you know i

249
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,839
on this question i just can

250
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,600
repeat what i have already said

251
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,959
we just call for respecting

252
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,360
of our sovereignty and we understand

253
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,000
that

254
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,800
the political crisis that we have in

255
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,200
belarus it's only our internal affair

256
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,599
and let the belarusian people um

257
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,200
choose their way by themselves and to

258
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
solve this problem by themselves

259
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,440
you're calling for dialogue with the

260
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,120
belarusian authorities and you've

261
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,959
established what you're calling the

262
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,880
national coordination council to

263
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,000
facilitate that

264
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
how do you see that working

265
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:44,240
you know we are at the beginning of

266
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,399
uh of this job i'd say yeah

267
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,399
and of course we are sure that

268
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,000
our this coordinative coordination

269
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,839
council will play its role

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200
because there should be like a bridge

271
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,320
between authorities

272
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,639
and uh our people and

273
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
uh so as our people will have to be

274
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,160
heard

275
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,040
because we are not our people are not

276
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
going to stop

277
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,120
in in fighting for their rights so

278
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,120
there should be a body

279
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,200
authorities should talk with and

280
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,680
we are sure in our people and

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,720
coordinate coordination center will play

282
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,680
its role very soon

283
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,800
well dialogue requires at least two

284
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,319
partners right

285
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,479
uh have you gotten any indication from

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,600
mr lukashenko that his side is willing

287
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,320
to engage

288
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,639
with with your national coordination

289
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,639
council

290
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,480
you know they will have to once we don't

291
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,680
know how long

292
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,560
it will take but it will happen sooner

293
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,040
or later and

294
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:03,760
it's better for the country

295
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,760
for it happen as soon as possible

296
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,000
you said you're willing you said you're

297
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,680
willing to consider mediation from

298
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,120
international organizations to

299
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,120
facilitate dialogue

300
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,720
um what organization do you think would

301
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,639
be best suited

302
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,760
for that role do you think it would be

303
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,639
the os

304
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,800
is the osce the organizations for

305
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,120
security and cooperation in europe which

306
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,439
reiterated its offer to mediate again

307
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440

our internal uh affair

312
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,839
and we are ready to solve

313
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,560
it by ourselves but in the case

314
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,760
uh we will need a mediation of

315
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,569
international

316
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,040

no okay um

327
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,639
president lukashek or mr gilkeshenko has

328
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,279
adopted a military siege

329
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,959
posture right now claiming without

330
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,120
evidence that nato

331
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,518
is massing at the borders nato forces

332
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,519
are massing at the borders of belarus

333
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,680
lukashenko has signaled his confidence

334
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,120
in getting russia's military support we

335
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
got a signal from

336
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,880
moscow indicating that that support

337
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,239
would be forthcoming

338
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,959
if needed if necessary how concerned

339
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
are you that this confrontation is

340
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,479
becoming

341
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,479
militarized

342
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,479
you know we are rather concerned about

343
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,279
this situation

344
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,279
but uh

345
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,680
you know i have to admit that our

346
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,079
protests

347
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,680
are peaceful and

348
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:21,040
i think that uh uh

349
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:24,479
we would accept any uh integration in um

350
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,599
in our country as uh you know as in

351
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,279
as external interfering into in a

352
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,000
political affair of

353
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,240
our country so we are concerned but we

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,399
are sure that

355
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,399
all the countries will respect the

356
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,079
sovereignty of our country

357
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,920
this week uh

359
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
many people were following that i'm sure

360
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,880
people in moscow

361

362
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,399
tried reaching out

363
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,839
to the authorities in russia in a

364
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839
similar way

365
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,120
you know i have to admit that i

366
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,920
i talk to the leaders of

367
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,839
many countries by their initiative

368
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,959
and i'm really grateful to all

369
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,399
those leaders who expressed their

370
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,399
support to

371
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,399
belarus and people who are right who are

fighting for their rights

373
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,279
and have to admit that we are open for

374
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,920
dialogue with any country and for

375
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,639
applying for any countries for uh

376
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,639
talking to us

377
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,199
you uh said in your speech to the

378
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,120
european parliament this week that your

379
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,800
husband has been jailed you pointed that

380
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,279
out uh that you said he's been

381
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,719
jailed on trumped up charges you noted

382
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,120
there have been deaths beatings

383
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,040
disappearances and you pointed out

384
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,880
that some people have had to flee under

385
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,000
persecution you yourself

386
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,720
have fled to neighboring lithuania how

387
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,199
much

388
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,199
personal risk are you taking in your

389
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,839
role as leader of this

390
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,240
revolution if that's what you consider

391
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,240
yourself

392
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:17,039
i know maybe i wouldn't

393
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,760
like to talk about me because

394
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,079
i'm rather safe now here in lithuania

395
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,199
but

396
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:26,319
all my people uh are in belarus

397
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:30,799
and uh they are uh threatened

398
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:35,280
there and they are under the risk of

399
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,280
i know of repressions and

400
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,000
i'm aware of all the people who are

401
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,559
fighting on

402
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,559
for the rights there in belarus and

403
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,400
the more i have desire to uh

404
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,159
have desire you know to

405
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,120
win uh this so-called battle as soon as

406
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,480
possible for

407
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,600
all the belarusians feel safe and free

408
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,600
in our own country

409
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,760
you are in lithuania the people are

410
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,360
marching on the streets

411
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,240
in belarus mainly in minsk you have to

412
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,199
communicate

413
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,480
with them and this the the

414
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,960
demonstrations are

415
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,600
have to be coordinated somehow how

416
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,880
important

417
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,840
for your cause is access to digital

418
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,480
communications

419
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,879
networks and and also along with that

420
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,720
how

421
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,720
important is access to free press

422
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,080
you know it's a pity that

423
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,520
all our mass media in belarus obey to

424
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,120
uh you know to authorities

425
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,160
so people uh a lot of people around

426
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,239
our country they can't see

427
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,200
the reality what's going on belarus in

428
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,880
reality

429
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,799
uh they only can see what is on tv and

430
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,960
it's really very important for

431
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,120
belarusians to have alternative mass

432
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,160
media uh

433
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,239
so that's why internet is uh uh

434
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
extremely important in our situation

435
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,080
because uh

436
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
on the dates when internet was switched

437
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,439
off

438
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,080
uh for a couple of days after the

439
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,799
elections

440
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,240
it was very hard to communicate and

441
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,080
people

442
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,919
you know couldn't realize what's going

443
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,559
on in reality

444
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:39,039
so be grateful to all

445
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,360
mass media of all the countries who

446
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,559
who show what's going on in belarus who

447
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,479
show the truth

448
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,760
for our belarusian people and of course

449
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,720
to all the alternative mass media that

450
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,840
we have

451
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
in belarus

452
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,919
do you think because we're nearing the

453
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,400
end of our time unfortunately

454
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,159
as we get to the end i want to ask you

455
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,799
do you believe

456
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,360
that it's within belarus's current

457
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,720
capacity to resolve this crisis

458
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,719
peacefully by itself

459
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,879
you know i believe in belarus and people

460
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,320
i believe in the

461
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:28,480
desire to build new country

462
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,678
without dictator and i'm sure

463
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,679
that we will succeed

464
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,799
what do you fear most in this situation

465
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:46,640
even if i feel fear

466
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,880
