1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,640
said to us passengers i'm really sorry

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,399
but i made a wrong turn

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,559
you all need to get out and i call the

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,040
headquarters so that they can throw me

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,719
back

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,678
on the correct route this funny incident

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,198
set me thinking about the covet 19. if

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,600
only the world leaders

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,880
governments international organizations

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,800
were honest

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,519
as honest as the bratislava trump driver

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,720
the mistakes were made own up to them we

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,320
were not prepared

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,280
we failed where do we go from here

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,399
the to-do list is rather long find the

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
vaccine

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,680
put the world economy right on track

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,800
restore

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,920
jobs enroll welfare for the needy

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,559
deal with public debt and last but not

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,960
least

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,599
be prepared for the next black swan

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
one more anecdote do you remember men in

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,360
black

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,239
the blockbuster comedy from 1997.

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,239
it is about secret agents monitoring

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,479
alien activity on earth

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,600
there is one memorable line from the

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,000
film

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,640
the agent k with the face of tommy lee

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,760
jones

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,119
says imagine a giant cockroach with

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,000
unlimited strength

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,200
a massive inferiority complex and a real

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920
short temper

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,000
is tear-assing around manhattan island

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,960
in brand new edgar suit

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,040
that sounds like fun no ma'am we at the

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,119
fbi do not have a sense of humor

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,920
we are aware of end of quote

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,960
giant cockroaches are not on top of my

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,759
list of threats

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,880
but similarly respiratory viruses were

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,479
rarely mentioned

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,360
in reports before january this year

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,960
we as civil society government officials

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,280
business community

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,360
need to be prepared for the black swans

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,079
it may not be aliens but it can be

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,320
terrorists

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,520
or hackers it can be enormous

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,679
opportunities

53
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,360
but the fourth industrial revolution

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
brings

55
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,159
everybody who watched men in black knows

56
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,040
that there is a happy end to the story

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,479
the earth is protected from the scum of

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,039
the universe

59
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,440
if only real life solutions were that

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,440
simple

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,800
well i think that uh from what i have

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,238
seen uh globesec has

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,319
convened a very uh impressive group of

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,599
people that are subject matter experts

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,238
on our most

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,679
pressing global challenges and i've

67
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
really enjoyed the depth of the

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
conversations and i've learned a lot on

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,679
the topics and also

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,920
the energy and the ambition to do

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,840
something about these challenges

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,839
is something that i have felt so i think

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,920
if anyone is serious about

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,519
learning more and doing something about

75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:03:05,510
the challenges that we face

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:03:11,770
globally this is a great place to be

77
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,769
[Music]

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,159
well hello and uh welcome to the next

79
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
session

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,359
we're going to be talking about a more

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,599
geopolitical eu

82
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,560
amid growing instability in the

83
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,159
neighborhood

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,640
and i would like to introduce my

85
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,000
distinguished uh panel we've got uh

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,958
katarina matanova deputy

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,879
director general of dg neighborhood and

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,159
enlargement negotiations at the european

89
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,399
commission uh

90
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,079
roland freudenstein policy director at

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
the wilfred martin center

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,319
on european studies which is in brussels

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,080
jakob visniewski vice president

94
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,640
for strategy at globsec and malinda

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
bregu

96
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,559
the secretary general of the regional

97
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,599
cooperation council

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,120
in sarajevo

99
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,280
there's been a lot of talk recently

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,640
about european sovereignty

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,480
and a geopolitical commission

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,238
which i suppose is to distinguish it

103
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,358
from a political commission

104
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,000
uh of the last time round uh mr burrell

105
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,880
uh has talked about the language of

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,120
power

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,639
but how realistic is this is this just

108
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,160
this kind of nice slogan

109
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,759
or does it mean something

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,360
we're talking about growing instability

111
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
in the neighborhood but

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
which i mean our neighborhood is pretty

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,080
big and it stretches for all the way

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,440
from

115
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,719
uh belarus to libya uh

116
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,840
so the question is no

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,360
one what can the eu do and can it live

118
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,039
up to these ambitions

119
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,400
of being a geopolitical actor

120
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,360
or uh perhaps this is something that

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,320
we're going to

122
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,840
uh live to regret using this um

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,880
expression

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,000
well i'm going to ask first of all uh

125
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,280
jacob jacob visniewski um from globsec

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,440
um so to to to to start us off

127
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,359
you know jakub is this it would be great

128
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,719
if there was a geopolitical

129
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,560
uh if the eu had geopolitical clout 27

130
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,639
countries all acting together

131
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,680
uh to do good for europe

132
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,320
for our region and for the world

133
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,320
but is it realistic what do you think

134
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:39,280
uh hello greetings from sunny bratislava

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and my view of the geopolitical europe

136
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,039
is less

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,039
sunny and mind you it's not a criticism

138
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,919
of european institutions i think that

139
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,719
the fault

140
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,359
lies with the member states and the

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,639
mandate

142
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,840
that we have or not have given

143
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,759
to them it is very common for conference

144
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,479
panels like ours today

145
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,080
to conclude that it is time for europe

146
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,800
to become geopolitical

147
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,400
to be a superpower at the global stage

148
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,360
and i think this is a very

149
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,080
funny statement to make imagine that

150
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,120
this evening

151
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,159
i i come back home and i announce

152
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,160
to my wife and children

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,759
in case you haven't noticed that today i

154
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,479
will become a super dad

155
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,960
demanding even more respect or reverence

156
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,680
i i think it does not happen like this

157
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,120
you become a super god or a superpower

158
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,000
when you are useful and

159
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,000
or even indispensable for others and

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,800
objectively speaking for europe these

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
days it's very difficult to assume a

162
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,720
more effective

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
role at the global stage why first of

164
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,199
all europe is more

165
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,560
divided than it used to be many

166
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,599
countries want to cherry

167
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,560
big elements from global europe agenda

168
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,360
for example say poland and hungary a

169
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,240
second

170
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,160
reason why it is not so easy is that

171
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,800
europe of course is struggling

172
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,639
economically and socially ever since the

173
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,759
crisis of 2008

174
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,720
but also covet will definitely not

175
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
help italy is a good example of a

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,639
country

177
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,280
which is a shadow of of its former self

178
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
the third reason is that the eu is being

179
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,960
cash

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
strapped and it no longer can export the

181
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,960
stability

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,759
into neighborhood through enlargement or

183
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,120
any other

184
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,400
instrument neighbor neighbors simply

185
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,319
cannot be

186
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,880
that easily nudged into proper behavior

187
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,680
like democratic standards or integrating

188
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,719
their markets

189
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,360
with that of the eu the fourth reason

190
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,479
is that the world environment has

191
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,800
changed

192
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,719
where traditional european strengths

193
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,520
have decreased in importance

194
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,280
simply speaking the world is

195
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,039
transactional these days

196
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,400
europe has fewer friends and protons

197
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,120
turkey is a good illustration and china

198
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,520
and russia

199
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
have chosen to be rather fierce

200
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,919
competitors

201
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,240
than their partners and last reason

202
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,440
is that institutional reforms of the

203
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,720
last 10 years

204
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,360
have brought a mixed results i'm talking

205
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,879
about

206
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,599
external action service or or any other

207
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,319
institutional matters and it's very

208
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,560
difficult

209
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,840
for for the european commission to

210
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,759
conduct its role

211
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:32,880
when the real power

212
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:35,120
is increasingly shifting to the capitals

213
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,958
let me stop here and maybe in some other

214
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,000
intervention i could focus on the

215
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,919
constructive constructive agenda what

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,399
needs to be done and what can be

217
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,880
salvaged from this entire

218
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,080
situation right well that's a sort of

219
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,600
rather gloomy

220
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,600
but um straightforward um introduction

221
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,720
um melinda let's let's go to you uh

222
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,880
in recent discussions about

223
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,480
neighborhood and about foreign policy

224
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,080
there's been a lot of talk about

225
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,320
belarus the foreign ministers are

226
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,959
talking about that today in berlin

227
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,399
um then that will be no doubt linked to

228
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,839
the eastern mediterranean

229
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,560
and there's been a lot of talk about

230
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,880
libya but there's been much less talk

231
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,880
about the actual enlargement countries

232
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,800
uh to the south i mean namely

233
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,519
the western balkan uh six um

234
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,599
do you wish that the eu was acting more

235
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,200
geopolitically or how do you feel

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,600
this uh uh this geopolitical europe or

237
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,720
does it or does it really not mean much

238
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,839
much from

239
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,839
from where you sit

240
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,800
uh hello to everybody and thank you jean

241
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,000
so uh hello from from tirana this time

242
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,760
so my office uh

243
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
is in sarajevo but i'm actually in

244
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
tirana uh

245
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,880
well i've been thinking while reading

246
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,000
the question uh a lot and it's

247
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,720
not the first time that we hear about uh

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,080
the geopolitical eu or the role of the

249
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,120
geopolitics in na

250
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,640
in the region i know that some things

251
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,440
lead to other things

252
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,880
and time after time different crises

253
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,160
shift the attention

254
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,720
from the western balkans but we should

255
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,920
not

256
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,320
forget as well that before the pandemic

257
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
hit

258
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,000
everything and even during the first

259
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,399
months of the pandemic uh

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
we had the situation that we was even

261
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
more more

262
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,880
awkward and bizarre regarding the

263
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,760
western balkans

264
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,079
and i'm referring uh to the postponement

265
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,560
of

266
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,160
the decision on on the enlargement

267
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,319
package last year

268
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,279
and then the new methodology that was

269
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,839
introduced

270
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
and now i think that from that from that

271
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,760
time

272
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,040
uh everybody has welcomed uh the new

273
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,760
developments uh

274
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,279
as kind of let's say with the wishful

275
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,959
thinking that they will really

276
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,399
really push forward the process of

277
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,199
enlargement in the region

278
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,040
which has really taken a long a long

279
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
level so i will just give you two

280
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,240
examples

281
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,399
all the countries in the regions uh have

282
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,839
a contractual relationship

283
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,399
with the eu and that contractual

284
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,040
relationship or that contract is called

285
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,800
stabilization and association agreement

286
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,640
that stabilization and association

287
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,199
agreement was signed for example in

288
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:20,079
albania on 2006

289
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,720
and it has to expire in 10 years so 2016

290
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,719
the date was that time uh decided

291
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,079
thinking that after 10 years of beniya

292
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,519
would be a member state

293
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,239
the same goes for north macedonia but uh

294
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,240
again uh we cannot pick and choose uh

295
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,480
which problems the world will face

296
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,040
and and uh and definitely you has to be

297
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,920
a global a global player on that

298
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,000
but uh i would really pose the question

299
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,199
what do western balkans are still

300
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,680
waiting around from uh from the from you

301
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,320
uh and i think that that's uh that's

302
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,359
quite uh

303
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,680
quite important uh eu has still

304
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,639
a lot of role to play in the western

305
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,319
balkans

306
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,560
what western balkans i think would

307
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,839
expect is to have in front of them

308
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,160
a more silent and and assertive uh

309
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,120
eu member states i'm not referring to

310
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,120
the new commission

311
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,200
or the two eu institutions who are our

312
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,600
main partners in this journey

313
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,000
i'm referring to the member states to

314
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
their decision making to sometimes their

315
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,240
local policies

316
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,800
and and national agendas that do not

317
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,760
really leave room to think that western

318
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,800
balkans

319
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,279
outside eu it will not really benefit

320
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,399
the eu

321
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,040
it will only harm eu so uh

322
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,639
western balkans do expect a more a more

323
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,079
uh competitive eu

324
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,880
both on political and economic

325
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,560
perspective we do expect to break down

326
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,680
the barriers that can help western

327
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,000
balkans to move on and not stagnate

328
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,719
uh cooperation in the region has become

329
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,839
a reality

330
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,160
59 percent of the citizens support the

331
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,639
eu membership of their countries

332
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,319
eu has a lot of majority in the region

333
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,440
it's the main trading partner

334
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,800
for 72.8 percent uh

335
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,639
it's uh let's say the main the main uh

336
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,639
contributor in terms of fdi's it's uh

337
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,399
the main contributor in helping the

338
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,399
countries to face to face challenges

339
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,360
such as that of covet 19

340
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,200
with the recovery package of of 3.3

341
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,800
billion that was approved in uh

342
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,920
in springtime so there are a lot

343
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,120
of there is a lot of room uh for eu to

344
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,319
play its high

345
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,000
role in the region uh and i

346
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,320
i hope as well that some of the agendas

347
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,639
that

348
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,440
uh that started even during the pandemic

349
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,200
among

350
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,120
among the region and among the countries

351
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,959
in the region and i will go back and

352
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
mention that green lanes initiative that

353
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,959
was

354
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,240
too much appreciated this might be

355
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,680
a starting point to bring the region

356
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,760
closer to the eu to bring the region and

357
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,839
make it and make it be part of the

358
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,240
european supply chains

359
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,160
it will help the business uh to to

360
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,000
develop business and to improve

361
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,519
with each other it will help the real

362
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,760
connectivity in the region

363
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,839
it will help the transfer of know-how

364
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,800
and technology in the region

365
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,600
so that it will mean that will be less

366
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,839
threats

367
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,000
on the economic situation in the balkans

368
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,880
which is a big problem

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,839
less threats on people living massively

370
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,760
the balkans

371
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,040
and you know that that almost one in

372
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,439
four people

373
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,959
young people are eager to leave to leave

374
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,040
their home countries

375
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,959
this will mean that the region's

376
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,360
security i mean western balkans

377
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,638
will always be safer so there is there

378
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,839
is still a lot that i think

379
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,440
can can happen great well that thank you

380
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,240
very much i'm i'm going to to come back

381
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
to you because

382
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
uh but i i'm going to go on to roller

383
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,760
now but i

384
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,639
i have to say that uh if i have to think

385
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,000
of uh

386
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,199
one thing uh about the eu and

387
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,440
um uh western balkans over this pandaria

388
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,959
you know what i remember is um the the

389
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,240
president of serbia

390
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,719
uh saying that the eu was uh was useless

391
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,920
and that

392
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,279
uh serbia's real friend was china and

393
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,319
posters in belgrade

394
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,000
saying uh thank you brother xi so uh it

395
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,680
may be that the eu is it's

396
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,120
the the biggest contributor but the

397
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,760
question is perhaps people don't

398
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,760
realize that

399
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,240
do you want me to answer

400
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
go

401
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,920
roland maybe before you take over just

402
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,959
to quickly react on this last point of

403
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,000
tim

404
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,560
so he doesn't leave us stay hanging

405
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,199
about

406
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:04,719
uh president uh uh praising president xi

407
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,719
for the greatest okay

408
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,920
very quickly i'll very quickly react to

409
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,920
it that

410
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,319
uh indeed at the beginning at the

411
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,040
beginning europe had uh had a sneeze or

412
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,199
a or

413
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,719
or a little bit on yawn at the beginning

414
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,279
where where

415
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,399
borders were closing et cetera and i

416
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,240
think that

417
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,120
uh fairly rapidly uh we actually got our

418
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
act together and

419
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,680
realized that not only europe needs to

420
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,000
help each other among the member states

421
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,120
but

422
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,160
needs to offer a helping hand uh

423
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,839
to our friends in the balkans in the

424
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,800
neighborhood whether southern or western

425
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,000
neighborhood uh

426
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,599
eastern neighborhood and and also beyond

427
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,480
and under in europe uh branding

428
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,279
actually by mid-april we we we put

429
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,279
together

430
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,880
together with member states eu

431
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,000
institutions and eu financial

432
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,360
institutions

433
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,360
uh 25 billion euro package of support

434
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,720
but i'm not mentioning it for the for

435
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
the money but uh

436
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,839
to to address the point team that you

437
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,679
raised

438
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,918
with malinda uh really for the first

439
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,839
time in a very systematic way we

440
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,480
realized it's not only about the money

441
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,480
we put

442
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,400
but the communication that needs to go

443
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,599
with it because the amount of

444
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,240
disinformation

445
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,958
that there was at the beginning coming

446
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,439
from china

447
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,000
coming from russia coming from all sorts

448
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,960
of

449
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,600
places was necessary to address very

450
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,039
very

451
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,199
uh head-on and this is

452
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,320
what we started communicating and if you

453
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,919
post a question

454
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,480
now in serbia or anywhere else

455
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,640
and we have the data to support that

456
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,039
everybody would say that the eu was the

457
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,280
one

458
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,280
quickest to respond and and actually

459
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,799
deliver the goods

460
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,879
great okay we'll come back to you but uh

461
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,000
roland back to my

462
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,200
my question is a geopolitical europe uh

463
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,400
a useful expression i mean are we going

464
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,919
to see a sort of a

465
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,320
more muscular europe um which is going

466
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,600
to

467
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,520
impose its will in the eastern

468
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,520
mediterranean and belarus and

469
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,120
libya and so forth or or could that be

470
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,960
a problematic expression what do you

471
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,959
think yes

472
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,000
yes it could well first of all hello tim

473
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,640
hello everyone

474
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,760
thanks for having me and uh you know

475
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,320
hello from uh

476
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,160
kind of sunny and rainy brussels at the

477
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,000
same time which kind of reflects

478
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,760
probably the uh the situation of europe

479
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,960
that we're talking about here

480
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,720
so to your question tim uh i mean i have

481
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,080
a huge problem with the term

482
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,280
geopolitics in geopolitical

483
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,559
very often it's used basically as

484
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,960
code for power politics and yes

485
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,760
of course we have to build some more

486
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,080
muscles

487
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,559
and um we have to work on our

488
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,280
willingness to use the muscles

489
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,080
so language won't be enough but the

490
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,360
other implication of geopolitical

491
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,399
we are now seeing in belarus where

492
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,479
the self-appointed realists claim that

493
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,200
there are some

494
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,960
geopolitical like laws of gravity

495
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,480
that uh seem to indicate um

496
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,400
that neighbors of russia cannot

497
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,760
determine their own future you know as

498
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
far as their political system is

499
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,760
concerned

500
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,799
as far as uh you know sending uh

501
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,480
authoritarian kleptocrats to hell uh

502
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,080
and of course also as far as their

503
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,880
international allegiance and

504
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,760
and their alliances are concerned so so

505
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,000
you know i'd be

506
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,600
really really careful with using the

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,799
word geopolitics

508
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,199
because it somehow indicates that

509
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,918
some nations cannot choose their own

510
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,760
fate cannot choose their own future

511
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,440
because they happen to be neighbors of

512
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,200
this or that other nation

513
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,120
and uh those are usually china and

514
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,080
russia recently of course

515
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,280
uh so so so this is my objection to the

516
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,480
word geopolitical

517
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,120
but if it's just meant as a code word

518
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,080
for

519
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,120
the eu needs to be needs to work on its

520
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,000
capabilities

521
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,439
and its willingness to use force as one

522
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,880
component

523
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,760
of achieving its goals then i'm all in

524
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,280
favor but i

525
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:20,559
totally share jakub's skepticism

526
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:24,480
when he uh when he talked about the

527
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:27,440
limits uh to europe europe's uh

528
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,559
declared intention in the last 10 years

529
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,200
to become

530
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,678
uh a bigger global player and to become

531
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,200
uh

532
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,559
more geopolitical in that sense so

533
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,200
i think in order to achieve our goals uh

534
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,280
we also need allies and that's a that's

535
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,320
a key aspect i would like to throw into

536
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,399
this debate

537
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,799
europe will never be able alone to

538
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,799
become a global player we can only do so

539
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,440
with allies and that means other

540
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,600
democracies around the globe

541
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,200
and of course that's countries like like

542
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,559
canada australia but all

543
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
yeah japan and i think we have very good

544
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,918
chances

545
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,919
that after third of november in the

546
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,960
united states europe will

547
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,000
actually be able to remake to

548
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,400
renew the transatlantic alliance which

549
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,440
is

550
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,799
and remains key to everything europe

551
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,799
wants to achieve globally

552
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,678
okay well thank you thank you very much

553
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,639
uh we're going to come back to you uh

554
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,919
katarina

555
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,280
um you've heard

556
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,960
a lot of skepticism there um

557
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,559
there's been this uh clear

558
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,679
transactional element when it comes to

559
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,760
sort of belarus and the eastern

560
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,480
mediterranean with the greeks and the

561
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,840
the cypriots uh being kind of unwilling

562
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,600
uh

563
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,039
to to to to to to back uh tougher action

564
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,399
on belarus at what they want in the

565
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,440
eastern mediterranean

566
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,039
uh surely that's just going to sort of

567
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,360
think he's just going to um uh

568
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,559
the lowest common denominator which will

569
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,559
mean not much

570
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,879
well first of all thanks a lot for uh

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,880
inviting me

572
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:14,320
it's uh great to be uh virtually even

573
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,640
with globsec again and in my hometown of

574
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,158
bratislava which is indeed sunny

575
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:24,159
um few few reflections

576
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:27,600
uh first of all i i uh

577
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,320
very much understand the skepticism with

578
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,760
which uh

579
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,200
jakub started and and roland echoed

580
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,600
about the the uh the ability of the eu

581
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,000
of

582
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,360
acting uh uh together i mean there is

583
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
the perpetual

584
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,360
question there how much power the member

585
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,559
states are willing to

586
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,280
feed in the foreign policy arena

587
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,520
for the eu to have a more efficient and

588
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,200
faster decision-making process

589
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,760
and this uh this uh question is with us

590
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,039
in the in in in reaching our

591
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,440
geopolitical

592
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,080
ambitions and this is also a response to

593
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,919
you uh

594
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:09,120
tim uh the i would not

595
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,840
write off today at this hour

596
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,120
uh what is going to happen with belarus

597
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,520
what is going to happen

598
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,399
with the eastern mediterranean because

599
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,000
the one thing

600
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,520
to understand about europe is that

601
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,760
it is a process driven process-based

602
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,679
decision-making

603
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,480
consensus-making uh entity

604
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,520
so this is something that needs to gel

605
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,039
it needs to

606
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,240
it needs to grow and and eventually

607
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,200
in many cases maybe uh there are

608
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,840
exceptions

609
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,640
we reach the the right decisions but

610
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,480
it's a

611
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,919
it's not something that happens with the

612
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,960
snap of fingers

613
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,919
because it's uh it's a multi-stakeholder

614
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,480
a multi-stakeholder decision making so

615
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,919
uh

616
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,520
i think that it's important to see

617
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,840
what is happening now in the

618
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,400
international arena compared to

619
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,439
what was doable or what was happening on

620
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,080
the eu side

621
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,520
some time ago uh you look at the pesco

622
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,960
discussions and you look at the

623
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,240
discussions on

624
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,039
on cooperation in the in the defense

625
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,120
arena

626
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,400
and things that were unimaginable some

627
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,279
years ago

628
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,960
are are happening now it it's very much

629
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,640
the same thing with the economic

630
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,760
uh issues the fact that the eu is now

631
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,279
looking through

632
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,919
national budgets before they are

633
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,600
submitted to national parliament was

634
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,559
unimaginable before the

635
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,918
before the crisis i think that there is

636
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,399
always sort of

637
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,400
uh a push factor through various crises

638
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,279
that makes the integration

639
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,320
uh uh more deeper and more more

640
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,039
efficient

641
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,158
and the two big push factors right now

642
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,200
is the

643
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,400
loss of the eu sorry loss of the u.s

644
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,760
security

645
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,240
umbrella you know i'm sure that there

646
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,440
would be changes as roland mentioned in

647
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,840
a few months but

648
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,000
whether we would go to status quo it's

649
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,678
not it's not quite clear so the

650
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,240
the fact that we are on the left alone

651
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,720
or left with with fewer allies in

652
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,799
defending the multilateral order

653
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:20,320
is something that is is is giving the

654
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,080
eu the push to be more cohesive in the

655
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,678
in the international arena and the

656
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,960
second one is the uh

657
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,520
the assertive nationalism of of china

658
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,720
and and so trying to figure out how to

659
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,480
navigate that

660
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,799
and the third one perhaps not as

661
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,799
important as these two but the third one

662
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,000
when we talk about the neighborhood is

663
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,600
very important

664
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,559
is is is russia and the behavior of

665
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,039
of russia so i think that these are the

666
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,480
the

667
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:51,760
push factors that are

668
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,600
making europe more cohesive

669
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,000
uh uh also on the on the international

670
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
stage

671
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,480
but we are not there yet so i i mean i

672
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,039
share the skepticism but i see

673
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,720
i see uh developments and and

674
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,158
possibilities and i will use two

675
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,559
examples to

676
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,279
demonstrate that one we already

677
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,320
discussed

678
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,679
uh enlargement i mean after the

679
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,639
the pause and the

680
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,320
really sort of a major slowdown that

681
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,600
happened in the previous

682
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,879
election eu election cycle i think that

683
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,799
the recommitment to enlargement as a

684
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,520
realistic prospect

685
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,360
is now making uh its impact on the

686
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,400
region as malinda was also

687
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,600
also mentioning so i think that this is

688
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,760
one of the

689
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,439
key uh success policies of the eu is

690
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,080
back on the agenda

691
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,760
uh i think it was actually a very

692
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,320
instructive

693
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,520
very instructive hiccup on the way which

694
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,320
was

695
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,440
the pause on on albania north macedonia

696
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,559
at first and

697
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,840
what was important was the really strong

698
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,918
reaction

699
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,918
of the other member states pushing the

700
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,159
ones that did not want to

701
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,760
go through with it into accepting

702
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,400
enlargement

703
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,679
uh for the future so i think that it was

704
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,720
a very instructive

705
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,440
uh moment that happened uh

706
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,360
last fall with a positive outcome and

707
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,440
the second example i want to use

708
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,559
is uh is the role that the eu has played

709
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,840
uh in ukraine on the reform front i'm

710
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,600
not talking about the

711
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,799
means process but about the stabilizing

712
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,600
and sticking

713
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,799
with the ukraine through thin and thick

714
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,480
on the

715
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:43,840
on the reform agenda where the eu

716
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,880
has become the federator essentially

717
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,120
of uh of the international

718
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,159
support not only from the member states

719
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,639
but also from

720
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,760
from from other donors and instead of

721
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,799
speaking

722
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,679
uh managing the process in a way that

723
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,720
the international

724
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,840
community speaks with

725
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,679
one voice and and is able to to continue

726
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,000
supporting ukraine so i will leave it at

727
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,880
that just as these two examples

728
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,799
not perfect not the linear process but i

729
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,039
think we're getting there

730
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,080
okay but um i'm going to suggest that uh

731
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,200
being a geopolitical

732
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,240
europe means um basically

733
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,159
leaving belarus to its uh fate and uh

734
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,360
leaving belarus firmly under

735
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,880
uh the thumb of of moscow i mean i've

736
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,678
heard that referred to as this sort of

737
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,080
uh

738
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,440
kind of armenian solution that um

739
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,918
basically

740
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,159
you know we can we give it a little bit

741
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,200
here and there but it's going to remain

742
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,799
um under moscow's um thumb uh uh whether

743
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,039
people there like it or not and

744
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,039
that's

745
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,720
i don't know whether anyone would like

746
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,679
to pick that up

747
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,799
yeah could i um go ahead look yeah go

748
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,600
ahead

749
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,960
nail on the head uh absolutely this is

750
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,959
what some people are saying

751
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,960
i mean they're not using the same words

752
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,039
that you did they would never say we're

753
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,600
leaving the belarusians to their fate

754
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,399
no what they're saying is we're looking

755
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,760
reality

756
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:15,439
in the face we are seeing uh

757
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,080
geopolitical facts and so putin is never

758
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,279
going to

759
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,439
um permit the belarusians

760
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,799
to choose their own future that's what

761
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,080
these people are saying

762
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,360
and i think i think one has to severely

763
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,918
object to this

764
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,520
because it's not only it's not only

765
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,159
morally despicable

766
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,158
it is also it is and it is not only

767
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,200
contrary to all the values that europe

768
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,440
is built on

769
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,720
but it's also short-sighted and

770
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,240
unrealistic

771
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,279
because i mean what we've seen uh in

772
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,240
in belarusians waking up and

773
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,440
rising to the challenge um just in the

774
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,120
last three weeks

775
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,760
i think has been totally amazing um and

776
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,678
that should that should tell us that we

777
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,360
would seriously put ourselves on the

778
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,919
wrong side of history

779
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,399
if we now gave even the impression of

780
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:11,279
negotiating uh the future of belarus

781
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,959
with putin um you know i mean we're at

782
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,600
the moment our leaders are falling over

783
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,480
ourselves

784
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,520
over themselves in talking to putin

785
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,760
about belarus

786
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,279
well you know i mean they talking is

787
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,279
good uh there's nothing wrong with

788
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,120
talking they should clearly communicate

789
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,640
that here these are our red lines

790
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,120
if you cross those red lines there will

791
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,320
be consequences you know sanctions

792
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,479
um uh we will we will refuse to deal

793
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,480
with uh lukashenko if you keep him in

794
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,880
power beyond september 10th

795
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,520
um and so on and so on so uh

796
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,880
you know whereas whereas if we only give

797
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,440
the impression that we're

798
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,000
we're telling putin look you know i mean

799
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,760
if you

800
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
just keep your tanks out of belarus

801
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,919
will will totally agree to this

802
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,399
so-called armenian solution in other

803
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,640
words

804
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,678
belarus will remain in the eurasian

805
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,120
economic union

806
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,080
belarus will uh will not will never join

807
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,639
uh the eu or nato even in the far-flung

808
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,559
future

809
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,159
i mean look these are things for the

810
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,879
belarusian citizens

811
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,000
to determine and not for mr putin and

812
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,559
it's not for us

813
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,960
to even appear to be negotiating with

814
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,960
him about

815
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,880
with the words um hong kong uh and

816
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,000
china and uh is there anything we can or

817
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,240
could or should

818
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,360
be have done about about hong kong would

819
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,399
somebody like to

820
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,399
to pick that up

821
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,200
well i think that uh very very

822
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,678
okay you're jumping around

823
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,360
no i just want to i just want to echo uh

824
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,158
yeah i just want to echo what uh what uh

825
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,559
uh president vanderlian uh said and

826
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,960
which

827
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,000
which picks up on what roland just uh

828
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,679
just mentioned

829
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,399
that it's the i actually

830
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,399
don't see the call by the below russian

831
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,600
public for geopolitical

832
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,719
uh changes what i see is yearning by

833
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,279
a huge portion of the belarusian society

834
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,880
for a regime that allows free and fair

835
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,360
elections that allows

836
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,039
uh freedom of speech freedom of assembly

837
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,479
human rights etc

838
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:31,679
and and i think that uh

839
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,159
the eu is very much there to

840
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,880
support what the belarusian citizens

841
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,919
want

842
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,440
i let's not forget when we are talking

843
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,120
about armenian solution

844
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,559
armenian solution yes armenia continues

845
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,799
to be a member of the eurasian community

846
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,320
uh but there's been a regime change in

847
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,760
armenia

848
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,840
and and uh so what i what

849
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,879
what we very much would like to do and

850
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,918
our offering

851
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,200
to mr lukashenko is support for

852
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,200
we are calling for national dialogue

853
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,640
on the future of the country we are

854
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,679
supporting the

855
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,799
the civil society we are supporting the

856
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,960
the media

857
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,240
we just put together a fund or

858
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,840
contributed

859
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,399
significantly to a fund for the victims

860
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,000
of

861
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,039
violence and we very much subscribe to

862
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,679
the notion that

863
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,519
uh it should be below russian citizens

864
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,600
that choose the future of the country

865
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,840
not someone else

866
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,760
i suppose in the commission you must be

867
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,399
breathing a sigh of relief that uh

868
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,200
they're not

869
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,719
flying eu or europe lags because then it

870
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,000
would make it much more difficult

871
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,919
a sort of a ukraine redux perhaps

872
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,240
uh okay you you wanted to come in here

873
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,799
or yeah yeah but then roland and then

874
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,279
we've got a live question

875
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,480
right i would not like to bore you with

876
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,200
my reflections my

877
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,080
any longer be in this matter because i

878
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,279
fully agree

879
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,439
with my predecessors only bastards

880
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:08,480
and idiots actually would like to have

881
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,839
concerts of powers talking about the

882
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,960
fate of bela russians

883
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,440
without belarusians over the heads of

884
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,679
them

885
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,960
uh with russia so i think we are clear

886
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,839
on that of course

887
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,240
the devil lies in the details and my

888
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,918
memory goes back to the early 80s

889
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,158
when poland was in a very difficult spot

890
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,359
and the solidarity movement under leg

891
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,440
valencia

892
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:36,960
created some options for reform but this

893
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:40,480
regime change was not possible and hands

894
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,040
of people well well-meaning people in

895
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,599
the west

896
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,159
were tied so sometimes it's a very long

897
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,240
haul

898
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,320
sometimes it's about making all these

899
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,279
little inauspicious almost

900
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,159
boring things that katarina is talking

901
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,480
about

902
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,599
like helping with the media helping with

903
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,400
a

904
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,760
civil society and also we need to

905
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,839
understand that

906
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,400
we need not we must not commit the

907
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,400
mistakes that the other side is doing

908
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,520
which means that we cannot present but

909
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,160
we know better

910
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,599
the future of belarusians than the

911
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,640
belarusians themselves

912
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,160
this is a society which has a deep link

913
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,480
to russia and we have to

914
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,279
also understand that there are cultural

915
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,839
links

916
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,599
linguistic things and this is with

917
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,920
anybody who plans

918
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,119
a russian future already in the european

919
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,320
union or nato

920
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,320
should a little bit pause and

921
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,680
think twice because this is much more

922
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,280
complicated and much

923
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,319
more longer okay so yeah i'm so i'm

924
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,520
going to stop you there roland very

925
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,839
quickly because then we're going we've

926
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,119
got a live question

927
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,759
yeah about those eu flags you know let's

928
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,119
face it

929
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,560
the european union for many people

930
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,839
in eastern europe has become the formula

931
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,040
for democracy and the rule of law i mean

932
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,920
why should we be

933
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,880
happy or unhappy about some people

934
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,640
flying eu flags or not flying eu flags

935
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,400
if they do so um they are trying to say

936
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,279
that this is our preferred way to become

937
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
a modern

938
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,839
normal liberal democratic european

939
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,960
country with a functioning market

940
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,680
economy with a

941
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,079
with with with as little corruption as

942
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,799
possible that's what they want to say

943
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,040
and you know putin's conspiracy theories

944
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,040
and lukashenka's conspiracy theories

945
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,079
about this whole thing that's happening

946
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,480
in billabooze

947
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,119
being a machination of the west and the

948
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,680
cia

949
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,320
and who have you i mean this is going on

950
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,319
already

951
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,560
whether they're flying eu flags or not

952
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,680
so so tim to respond to your

953
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,839
sigh of relief theory uh i don't think

954
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,520
there is any sigh of relief about people

955
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,640
flying eu flags or not

956
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,400
all we want here in brussels is for

957
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,279
belarusians to be able to determine

958
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,119
their fate and

959
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,599
within our modest our modest limited

960
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,520
possibilities i think we will and we are

961
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,640
doing everything we can to help them in

962
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,480
this

963
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,160
great thank you okay well now we've got

964
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,480
our first uh live

965
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,480
question

966
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,879
thank you very much uh for connecting me

967
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,640
my name is cornelia bachu and i'm

968
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,560
connecting actually directly from the

969
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,560
ecpr conference

970
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,799
which is the largest uh gathering of

971
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,640
political scientists in europe so i do

972
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,119
hope that my question

973
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,359
is not going to be too theoretical uh

974
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:36,240
but i think it is important to address

975
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:39,119
when we talk about mega trends

976
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,680
so to make the connection to the meta

977
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,720
theme

978
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,879
of this session the question is uh and

979
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,040
which i would like to post to you

980
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,000
what is your prediction about the role

981
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,480
of the eu

982
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,040
in the future world order so in other

983
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,680
words

984
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,279
um how do you see europe in let's say

985
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,919
2050

986
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,040
uh do you see europe as a big power as a

987
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,560
small power

988
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,800
as a no power or as a hegemon

989
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,040
and i was wondering uh what would be the

990
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,079
advantages and the disadvantages

991
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,000
of the eu being a hegemon in the future

992
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,560
world order

993
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
that is my question thank you very much

994
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,599
great okay well i'm going to ask

995
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,119
that's the type of question which um

996
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,160
from political scientists which we could

997
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,560
probably talk about

998
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,560
for the next uh week or so but we've got

999
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,960
to we really don't have very have

1000
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,680
very much time um my linda we haven't

1001
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,079
heard from you

1002
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,879
again so i'm going to come straight to

1003
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,040
you uh

1004
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,040
the eu and in 2015.

1005
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,160
uh well listening now uh

1006
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,160
the discussion about uh the

1007
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,520
all the worse and which is right on the

1008
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,799
language of powers

1009
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,480
spoken for so long in vila russia

1010
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,560
i was thinking that the language of

1011
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,560
power is impeccably spoken in western

1012
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,160
balkans as well

1013
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,839
so since years i would say and

1014
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:05,839
i was thinking thinking a bit and i hope

1015
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:09,680
uh that the reaction or the attention

1016
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:12,400
uh of eu and other global players

1017
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,359
in the region as well as it happens time

1018
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,240
after time

1019
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,880
will not to be quite high only when a

1020
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,919
crisis

1021
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,280
appears to be quite quite big and not

1022
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,960
and can be can be handled because the

1023
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,320
situation in the region has changed a

1024
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,119
lot so and and if

1025
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,640
i i can i can just pick a bit uh on this

1026
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,359
concept of geopolitical

1027
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,960
uh narrative on western balkans i think

1028
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,000
that there is a change in the western

1029
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,800
balkans uh

1030
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,280
as well because until some years ago uh

1031
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,160
said

1032
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,800
poorly uh external actors had a stronger

1033
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,440
say

1034
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,680
but now uh nothing can be can be

1035
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,119
dictated or planned without considering

1036
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,799
uh that respective leaderships are uh

1037
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,560
ready keen to be to be asked and then

1038
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,640
and then heard so uh the active

1039
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,599
actors in in in shaping the interest of

1040
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,960
geopolitical

1041
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,760
actors uh in uh in their favor will have

1042
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,240
as well uh

1043
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,000
to hear a lot and then expect even the

1044
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,879
reaction from the local elites in the

1045
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,240
region

1046
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,720
which makes me uh sorry my linda

1047
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,560
interrupt the question is about 2050

1048
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,118
tell us briefly yes which makes me are

1049
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,599
you going to be like in 2050

1050
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,520
yes so uh and and that makes me makes me

1051
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,640
think on the 2050 what well

1052
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,440
20 20 50 it's a long way

1053
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,799
forward i hope that before the the 20th

1054
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,599
2050

1055
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,960
we will have western balkans and uh part

1056
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,359
of part of the use so

1057
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,319
uh all of the countries being being

1058
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,720
members of

1059
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,960
of the eu and for all the reasons that i

1060
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,399
mentioned i mentioned above this is of

1061
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,720
utmost importance but well 2050 it's

1062
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,319
too far from now so i wouldn't really go

1063
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,680
on on projecting

1064
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,319
a future in 30 years 20 has already

1065
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,359
passed for

1066
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,920
for the region and i do i do expect and

1067
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,040
i hope

1068
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,000
that the situation will start to change

1069
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,640
immediately if there is no reaction now

1070
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,680
on

1071
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,240
then on 2050 two scenarios might be

1072
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,759
might be in place first we might have

1073
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,959
western balkans joining

1074
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,800
uh the eu just in terms of of uh

1075
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,760
of papers because people would have

1076
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,280
joined you already by leaving one by one

1077
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,359
and then i might even imagine one of

1078
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,319
your of your major concerns being being

1079
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,880
published and

1080
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,800
said and and being present everywhere

1081
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
that western balkans will be shrinker in

1082
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,760
number

1083
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,040
and that might really be a big problem i

1084
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,599
don't think that that will really

1085
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,040
really help uh the not not even the

1086
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,960
western balkans

1087
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,720
that the population of this region and

1088
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,920
it won't really really

1089
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,759
give any any better shape to to you all

1090
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,440
right so katarina

1091
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,800
katrina 2015

1092
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,319
katarina 2015 very briefly what going to

1093
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,880
be like in 2050 will

1094
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,800
the use it exist or will it be a hegemon

1095
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,280
as we were asked

1096
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:12,000
but briefly if 2050 is too far ahead uh

1097
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:15,040
you can reduce it to maybe 2035.

1098
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,400
well let me let me say this the eu will

1099
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,560
definitely be around

1100
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,160
and considering uh that eu always grows

1101
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,520
through crises

1102
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,560
and makes leaps forward through crises

1103
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,119
and looking at the world today i do

1104
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,599
expect many crises coming along so the

1105
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,760
eu

1106
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,280
will be internally strengthening through

1107
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,560
that process so

1108
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,440
2050 you will be alive and kicking i

1109
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,560
would say

1110
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,480
i would say an important power i

1111
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,400
wouldn't necessarily go as far as

1112
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,920
calling it hegemon but definitely will

1113
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,000
be around

1114
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,160
great roland hegemon not existing

1115
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,520
where are we going to be in 2015. it

1116
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,720
will be part of a global

1117
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,119
alliance of democracies will have solved

1118
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,879
the

1119
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,720
rule of law problems in the european

1120
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,160
union itself and we'll be discussing

1121
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,078
really important things such as you know

1122
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,640
whether we need whether we need to

1123
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,920
address the spiritual needs of

1124
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,680
of artificial intelligence machines um

1125
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,680
or the colonization of planet mars

1126
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,000
great okay jacob

1127
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,079
i just want to say that i exclude the

1128
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,359
possibility of the european union not

1129
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,359
existing

1130
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,400
i think that it might makes my life

1131
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,520
worthwhile to

1132
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,960
to fight for the big status of europe on

1133
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,520
the global stage

1134
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,560
i believe in some areas we are destined

1135
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,119
to succeed

1136
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,480
for example the digital sphere and the

1137
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,359
digital revolution

1138
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,520
for example climate change global trade

1139
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,960
democracy

1140
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,319
multilateralism these are all areas

1141
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,079
where european strength

1142
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,640
are already here today

1143
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,520
thank you thank you very much well

1144
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,879

1145
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:04,160
i i kind of feel we've just just begun

1146
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:08,160
and um unfortunately it is already

1147
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:11,040
uh 2 45 um in in bratislava so

1148
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,640

1149
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,079
come to an end of this session

1150
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,520

1151
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,040

capture and i'm sorry we've really just

1159
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,760
started this topic uh maybe

1160
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,359
um globs they could have a whole few

1161
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,800
days devoted to this

1162
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,480
that would be that would be useful i

1163
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,920
think jakob if you've got that down we

1164
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,720
could do a whole few days on the future

1165
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,880
of europe

1166
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,879
so thank you very much indeed to
