i'm jakub visnewski from globsec

6
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,959
few days ago i was taking a tram in

7
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,519
bratislava

8
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,079
to my utter astonishment it suddenly

9
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
changed

10
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:07,040
direction then it stopped the driver

11
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,160
got out of her compartment she smiled

12
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,360
apologetically

13
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,040
and said to us passengers i'm really

14
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,800
sorry but i made a wrong turn

15
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,959
you all need to get out and i call the

16
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,439
headquarters so that they can throw me

17
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,119
back

18
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,160
on the correct route this funny incident

19
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,399
set me thinking about the covet 19. if

20
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,079
only the world leaders governments

21
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,279
international organizations

22
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,279
were honest as honest as the bratislava

23
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,920
trump driver

24
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,480
the mistakes were made own up to them we

25
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,160
were not

26
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
prepared we failed where do we go from

27
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,760
here

28
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,880
the to-do list is rather long find the

29
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,600

30
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,959
put the world economy right on track

31
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,920

enroll welfare for the needy deal with

33
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,920
public debt

34
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,720
and last but not least be prepared for

35
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,639
the next

38
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,720
blockbuster comedy from 1997.

39
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,720
it is about secret agents monitoring

40
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
alien activity on earth

41
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,079
there is one memorable line from the

42
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,479
film

43
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,120

aware of

54
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,680
end of quote giant cockroaches

55
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,560
are not on top of my list of threats but

56
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,638
similarly

57
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,160

it may not be aliens but it can be

64

terrorists or hackers

65
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,880

126
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,440
remarks

127
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,720
today we're here to discuss um the u.s

128
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,839
china relations

129
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,160
um and the challenge of arising china

130
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,160
for

131
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,959
a western liberal order

132
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,399
every day seemingly every week there

133
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,239
seems to be a new crisis in the

134
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,959
bilateral relations

135
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,480
it seems to be spiraling downward and

136
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,439
out of control

137
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
at this point what is the the end game

138
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,959
really

139
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,000
for the way relations are going how do

140
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,399
we reduce

141
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,399
tensions

142
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,800
well i suppose there are three possible

143
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
end games if you look at the

144
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,880
underlying dynamics of the u.s china

145
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,399
relationship

146
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,360
one is a hot war the second is sliding

147
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,320
slowly inexorably into a cold war

148
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
or thirdly is to find some exit ramp

149
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,160
from

150
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,160
a and b above in terms of the exit ramp

151
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,079
however that would require

152
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,639
a considerable change in terms of

153
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,279
china's current policy direction

154
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,040
because china has become more assertive

155
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,800
in its international

156
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,279
policy in the last several years

157
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,359
particularly under xi jinping

158
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,240
and the united states at least since

159
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,079
2017 has begun to react

160
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:49,199
first episodically now more systemically

161
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,680
and if the democrats win the

162
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,839
upcoming presidential race i would think

163
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,399
that would continue but probably

164
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,959
on an even more systematic basis so the

165
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,959
challenge

166
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,040
for the diplomacy on both sides of this

167
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,079
equation both in beijing

168
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,959
and washington is to identify

169
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,799
what possible exit ramps exist but i

170
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,959
cannot see that occurring

171
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,480
unless china begins to moderate some of

172
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,480
its current policy behaviors

173
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,480
with the upcoming u.s election there are

174
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,079
of course

175
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,039
domestic um influences upon u.s foreign

176
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,599
policy at this

177
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,160
this point with china and china's

178
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,918
current

179
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,080
international trajectory what the

180
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,960
domestic factors behind

181
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,320
xi jinping's current strategy and what

182
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,039
the constraints against them

183
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,039
changing course

184
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,760
well the question is an important one

185
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,799
because often uh when we

186
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,000
analyze the u.s china relationship we

187
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,520
look at either through a foreign

188
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,480
policy perspective or we look at it from

189
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,000
the drivers from u.s domestic politics

190
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,080
but the reality is there is a third

191
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
dimension here which is chinese domestic

192
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,280
politics

193
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,879
often opaque to the rest of the world

194
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,840
but frankly critical for us

195
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,840
all so if you look specifically at xi

196
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,959
jinping

197
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,159
yes he is by far and above china's

198
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,360
single most powerful leader since mao

199
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,280
on top of that he has um

200
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,719
embraced a policy uh posture

201
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,320
which is uh infinitely more assertive

202
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,160
than that of his three most recent

203
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,639
predecessors

204
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,080
and he would like i think within his

205
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,000
period in office

206
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,000
uh to bring about for example

207
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,320
reunification with taiwan

208
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,280
assuming he can hold on to office during

209
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,918
the 2020s which lie ahead of us

210
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,918
but politics in any country even

211
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,039
authoritarian states is not without its

212
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,799
opposition

213
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,320
so the nature of the opposition to xi

214
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,639
jinping is

215
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,760
a from a group of people who see him as

216
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,080
having taken

217
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,840
the domestic politics of china far too

218
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
far to the left

219
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
okay

220
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,320
so with the upcoming u.s election um

221
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,799
china is of course watching much like

222
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,200
the rest of the world very closely

223
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,158
what could they be hoping for as we see

224
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,640
china has become

225
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,120
a real fixture in american foreign

226
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,400
policy discussions become a real

227
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,879
um one of the major issues really

228
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
for us domestic politics at the moment

229
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,080
as well

230
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,158
um what kind of changes could we expect

231
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,918
of a shift in administration

232
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,120
or with china be looking for continuity

233
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,880
i think you're right to say that in the

234
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,360
u.s presidential election

235
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,840
china not only looms large but in fact

236
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,918
is relevant to

237
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,918
obviously all three of the major

238
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,480
questions which have been

239
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,200
posed in the debate one is when will

240
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,120
america recover from covert 19

241
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,280
2 what will be the economic damage and

242
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,760
who has a way out of it

243
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,960
and three on top of that what is

244
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,720
america's future in the global order

245
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,000
of course china is fundamental to all

246
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,760
the above

247
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,120
what's china hoping for in terms of a

248
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,720
political outcome

249
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,559
on balance the chinese would still

250
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,360
prefer trump to win

251
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,600
many would find this puzzling as an

252
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,678
observation but the bottom line is

253
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,280
the chinese have judged that trump does

254
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,080
not have any appetite for

255
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,158
conflict or war with china that trump is

256
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,600
by definition bellicose

257
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,320
that china uh that trump will prosecute

258
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,719
a vigorous trade and economic agenda but

259
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,439
he'll prosecute a much weaker

260
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,880
security policy agenda against china and

261
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,960
an infinitely weaker

262
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,159
weaker agenda against china on human

263
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,159
rights

264
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,280
therefore for those reasons china on

265
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,799
balance sees

266
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,320
trump as a better outcome for their own

267
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,799
national interests

268
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,039
and their track record for analyzing

269
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,080
that is they've seen trump time and time

270
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,960
again

271
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,960
intervene to derail the rest of the

272
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,240
administration's relatively hard-line

273
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,720
strategy uh on on china

274
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,400
if biden wins i think what the chinese

275
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,120
are concerned about a little bit like

276
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,480
hillary clinton four years ago

277
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,439
is that instead there would be a

278
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,720
different hardline systematic

279
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,559
strategy against china because many of

280
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,919
the personnel who would form part of the

281
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,879
national security

282
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,480
and foreign policy team for a biden

283
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,080
presidency would have been those who

284
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,400
staffed it also

285
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,918
for hillary clinton i think that's

286
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,720
therefore how beijing would view the

287
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,720
current reality

288
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,440
you mentioned a more hardline approach

289
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,760
toward china

290
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,720
what would this look like a hardline

291
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,360
approach

292
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,919
in practice and what would the chinese

293
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,080
worst case scenario of this be

294
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,559
what was their perception of a hardline

295
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,559
strategy

296
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,639
well let's look at it first in terms of

297
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,320
the economy

298
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,240
there's what we describe as the wider

299
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,879
debate on decoupling

300
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,279
at present the focus on the part of the

301
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,200
trump administration

302
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:52,400
is in relation to trade

303
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,880
and the deconstruction

304
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,000
of global supply chains which are china

305
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,159
dependent

306
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,360
and you see already the outworkings of

307
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,559
that with a number of global

308
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,080
corporations

309
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,000
beginning to offshore their

310
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,720
manufacturing

311
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,799
requirements to the rest of southeast

312
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
asia or elsewhere

313
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,200
but under the democrats the open

314
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,679
question is would they then take

315
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,480
what's happened with for example the

316
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,200
trump administration's ban on huawei

317
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,640
as a provider of global 5g technology

318
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,600
and expand that ban

319
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,360
more broadly into all other categories

320
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,559
of high technology

321
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,918
whether that's computer chips

322
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,918
microchips semiconductors whether it

323
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,799
extends further across the entire

324
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,320
artificial intelligence span

325
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,158
and from china's perspective that would

326
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,399
be difficult and damaging because they

327
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,919
still lag considerably behind

328
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,600
the united states and the rest of the

329
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,360
world in terms of the manufacture of

330
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,520
semiconductors

331
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,719
and so that's on the question of

332
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,240
technology

333
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,039
but the six thousand dollar question

334
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,600
literally under the democrats would be

335
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,039
what do they do indeed what would the

336
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,799
republicans do

337
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,879
if it came to decoupling the two

338
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,480
countries financial markets

339
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,720
now that would be of profound

340
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,760
significance given the size of china's

341
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,679
own uh capital reserves and what it

342
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,200
seeks now to invest both at home and

343
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,720
abroad

344
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,799
so the open question is what would

345
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,480
happen in capital markets

346
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,039
in the national security space i think

347
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,919
you're more likely to see a systematic

348
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,600
doubling down by the democrats in

349
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,000
support of its friends and allies in

350
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,480
southeast asia in the south china sea

351
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,559
and probably an equally robust posture

352
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,360
with the current

353
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,720
administration on the question of taiwan

354
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,559
and finally i think where it would

355
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,880
differ

356
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,760
demonstrably would be the democrats

357
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,960
would take on

358
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,760
china across the board on human rights

359
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,240
this is much more a fundamental democrat

360
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,320
constituency concern that it has been

361
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,080
certainly for the trump administration

362
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,879
and this is of concern to china

363
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,799
because human rights and an effective

364
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,640
international critique of it

365
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,720
tunnels back into chinese domestic

366
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,400
politics and the long-term political

367
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,400
legitimacy of the chinese regime

368
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,879
with a democrat agenda and a a

369
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,559
re-emphasis on human rights could we

370
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,559
expect to see more

371
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,000
direct actions in regard to the

372
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,799
situation in xinjiang

373
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,880
and also the changes in hong kong and

374
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,440
how would that affect chinese domestic

375
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,440
politics

376
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,480
i think you will see a doubling down on

377
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,520
the part of us

378
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,000
policy and strategy on these various

379
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,600
issues if you look at hong kong first

380
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,080
obviously the passage of the hong kong

381
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,678
national security law

382
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,240
the response by the united states

383
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,760
congress on a bipartisan basis

384
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,279
with the hong kong human rights and

385
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,039
democracy act earlier

386
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,440
and now the hong kong sovereignty act

387
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,720
more recently

388
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,799
the sanctioning of individuals but again

389
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,600
the six thousand dollar question will be

390
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,679
if repression continues in hong kong

391
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,240
will the united states then

392
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,200
uh begin to look at uh decoupling the

393
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,520
current

394
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,400
peg and link between the hong kong

395
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,879
dollar and the u.s

396
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,480
dollar which makes it possible for hong

397
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,159
kong to still be

398
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,240
one of the world's largest financial

399
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,039
centres and why this is relevant to

400
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,200
china

401
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,320
is because the hong kong financial

402
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,480
market is where

403
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,279
many prc companies raise their uh

404
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,279
dollar denominated capital raisings so

405
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,640
that would be i think a real risk in

406
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,159
terms of

407
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,279
hong kong if you flip up to xinjiang

408
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,039
then of course there begins to be a

409
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,039
symmetry emerging

410
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,760
in congressional and therefore by

411
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:49,200
extension democrat responses

412
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,279
between xinjiang and hong kong

413
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,039
in terms of the sorts of laws and

414
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,559
resolutions being adopted by the united

415
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,480
states congress

416
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,039
so the pressure will come on again for a

417
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,880
more extensive sanctions regime

418
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,200
this gets serious when it begins to

419
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,279
touch on financial sanctions against

420
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,360
chinese state institutions

421
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,279
because that given the centrality of the

422
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,479
dollar to international financial

423
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,960
markets still

424
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,880
would then impede the capacity of china

425
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,240
to become a greater and greater player

426
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,240
in global financial markets

427
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,520
could we expect to see china pushing

428
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,240
back against the dollar hegemony

429
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,720
in the near future worth their security

430
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
outlook

431
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,000
to really identify the pillars of

432
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,559
american power as being

433
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,080
its military predominance and also its

434
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,399
financial power

435
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,520
um there already seem to be maneuvers of

436
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,158
china

437
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,600
um trying to challenge the dollar um in

438
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,760
some sense especially

439
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,360
with regard to its new cryptocurrencies

440
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,640
can we expect to see more

441
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,639
such policies in future

442
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:55,039
will you write to us as i've written

443
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,399
uh consistently and extensively that the

444
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,480
twin pillars of american power are

445
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,918
the power of its military conventional

446
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,399
and nuclear

447
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,360
plus uh the power of u.s dollar as a

448
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,320
global

449
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,918
reserve currency and therefore the

450
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,158
currency of exchange

451
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,600
overwhelmingly in global financial

452
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,799
markets

453
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,279
so china full of

454
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,559
realists has been seeking to close the

455
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,360
gap on both these

456
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,960
equations over a long period of time as

457
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,879
far as the dollar is concerned

458
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,080
china's strategy has come in several

459
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,240
waves

460
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,320
first they've tried to establish during

461
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,679
the first decade of this century

462
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,799
a whole series of bilateral

463
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,000
currency swaps between local currencies

464
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,720
and the renminbi

465
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,880
and all in order to avoid using the

466
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,200
intermediation of the us dollar

467
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,559
in settling international trade accounts

468
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,520
the problem is that still after 15 years

469
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,080
or so

470
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,240
has only resulted in a relatively small

471
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:03,520
proportion of global trade

472
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:07,679
being denominated in non-us dollar terms

473
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:11,279
the second wave of the approach by the

474
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,360
by the chinese uh in dealing with the

475
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,360
challenge of the us dollar has been

476
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,080
through the international monetary fund

477
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,399
and having the renminbi accepted as as

478
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,559
part of the global basket

479
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,840
of special drawing rights or so-called

480
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,960
sdrs

481
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,520
uh that occurred about a decade ago

482
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,799
and but once again if you look at the

483
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,200
proportion

484
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,639
of countries around the world who have

485
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,240
renminbi

486
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,399
in their national foreign reserves uh

487
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,679
the total proportion of reserves held in

488
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,000
renminbi

489
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,240
as opposed to the us dollar or other

490
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,039
hard currencies like

491
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,159
the euro or the yen is still relatively

492
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,399
small

493
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,279
so now we see the third wave which is

494
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,199
the launch recently of the digital rmb

495
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,200
china strategy there i think is looking

496
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,279
at the explosion in digital commerce

497
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,880
which they've had domestically

498
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,039
over the last several years through

499
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,320
alibaba and alipay and their domestic

500
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,960
competitors

501
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,600
has seen us now rolling out globally and

502
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,679
therefore

503
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,840
if china's being able to dominate the

504
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,919
global technology markets for the

505
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,678
global digital commerce through these

506
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,919
massive platforms

507
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,799
then their argument is we could also

508
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:27,919
dominate global markets as well

509
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,918
in having the digital

510
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,480
markets settled

511
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,320
in a digital renminbi and this has

512
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,000
recently been launched of course with

513
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,760
the covert 19 crisis

514
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,919
and the migration of much commerce

515
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,640
online it's possible we'll see

516
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,159
more and more of this but what's the

517
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,080
ultimate problem

518
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,919
the ultimate problem is still that china

519
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,879
refuses to liberalize

520
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,679
its capital account uh continues to

521
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,480
refuse to liberalize its currency

522
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,279
uh in terms of foreign exchange markets

523
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,480
and as a result

524
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,840
china does not have the confidence the

525
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,480
international community

526
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,360
to become a preferred currency in terms

527
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,840
of

528
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,760
what would then become a central player

529
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,080
in global financial markets

530
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,440
so so long as china refuses those two

531
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,240
core decisions

532
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,080
and frankly causes the rest of the world

533
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,440
to fear that it would still politically

534
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,240
intervene

535
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,919
in terms of the value of its currency if

536
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,279
it felt as if political sovereignty

537
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,360
questions were at risk

538
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,960
it's going to be quite a long time still

539
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,039
before the remnb

540
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,320
is in a position to effectively

541
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,000
challenge uh

542
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,000
the dollar's current supremacy

543
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,960
and as for global um economic order

544
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,559
more generally speaking with the

545
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,159
coronavirus

546
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,480
a lot of debate is being had as to

547
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,720
whether china is competing with the us

548
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,840
in terms of presenting its model of

549
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
politics

550
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,360
having been more efficient in dealing

551
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,200
with the pandemic

552
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,399
and your writings for foreign affairs

553
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,360
you've argued that both

554
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,639
the us and china have lost some of their

555
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,080
global prestige

556
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,360
could you speak to that a little bit

557
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:16,158
more and explain why that might be

558
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,158
and what the next steps would be for

559
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,959
reestablishing some control over the

560
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,960
coronavirus

561
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,840
well i think there's been an assumption

562
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,039
on an argument by some

563
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,080
um as is the way with many of these more

564
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,640
superficial international debates

565
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,399
that uh when chronovirus broke out in

566
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,159
china in january february

567
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,639
that this was going to deal a mortal

568
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,039
blow to the chinese communist state

569
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,960
in fact as i've written elsewhere you

570
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,840
could almost hear the audible popping of

571
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,480
campaign

572
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,480
of champagne corks in various corridors

573
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,720
in the pentagon

574
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,640
that was dumb in itself because it

575
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,760
failed to demonstrate any level of real

576
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,519
solidarity

577
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,919
with the chinese people going through a

578
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,840
terrible period of pain and suffering

579
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,279
but also it was grossly premature

580
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,240
because it assumed that the chinese were

581
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,600
not getting control

582
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,079
get in control of this and instead what

583
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,399
emerged was a china which could have

584
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,720
could effectively through its own

585
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,918
authoritarian systems and surveillance

586
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,959
technologies

587
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:22,719
bring about levels of social

588
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,000
surveillance and and uh social isolation

589
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,439
uh which would perhaps have been

590
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,199
impossible in western liberal

591
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,000
democracies

592
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,480
however the takeout is this the

593
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,560
centralized one-party state nonetheless

594
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,240
fail to prevent the outbreak of this

595
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,918
thing there were huge

596
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,239
failures in the chinese system in the

597
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,679
first critical three to four weeks of

598
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,520
the initial outbreak

599
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,839
which enabled it to go from a local

600
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,399
outbreak and a part of wuhan

601
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,239
in hubei province in china to then head

602
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,319
out across the entire city the rest of

603
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,560
the province and to other parts of china

604
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,320
and then to the world and doesn't matter

605
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,759
how much propaganda is applied to this

606
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,200
the bottom line is that's where the

607
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,200
virus came from

608
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,680
and the chinese system failed to contain

609
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,359
it in those first critical few weeks

610
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,680
and they should have done so based on

611
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,200
the deep learnings from the sars

612
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,319
outbreak of a decade or so before

613
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,480
as for the united states obviously the

614
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,200
champagne cork ceased to be popped

615
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,400
when the virus arrived in the u.s of a

616
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,439
and then we saw

617
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,520
on full display the rank incompetence of

618
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,920
the trump administration's efforts to

619
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,359
rein

620
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,480
in the virus across the united states

621
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,640
ranging from non-scientific denialism

622
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,200
on the part of the president through to

623
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,319
his episodic advocacy a bit like a 19th

624
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,279
century

625
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,640
quack apothecary of certain cures for

626
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,560
the american people

627
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,720
to then blaming the states of the us

628
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,040
federation for their

629
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,240
differing levels of response but what's

630
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,359
been on display

631
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,359
around the world and used for propaganda

632
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,359
purposes within china itself

633
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,560
is the dysfunctionality of the american

634
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,279
democracy

635
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,040
in dealing with this challenge but at

636
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,720
the same time

637
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,119
other democracies for example in new

638
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,959
zealand other democracies for example in

639
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,119
canada and other democracies

640
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,960
in various parts of europe have managed

641
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,359
this reasonably well

642
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,359
not to mention those in japan and most

643
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,560
acutely from a chinese perspective on

644
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,480
taiwan

645
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,799
what happens in the post-covered world

646
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,119
whenever that happens to be

647
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,000
if and when we obtain a virus and that

648
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,240
vaccine i should

649
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,599
say against the virus and the vaccine is

650
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,200
properly distributed

651
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,119
i think we're going to see a damaged

652
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,799
china and a damaged america

653
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,320
and the question for both of them is how

654
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,119
do they rebuild

655
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,640
domestically but most critically rebuild

656
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,400
a global credibility

657
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,200
which for different reasons has taken a

658
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,200
huge whack as a result of covet 19.

659
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,160
i believe we're taking a question from

660
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,520
russia

661
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,520
be appearing on screen

662
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,920
uh hello uh and uh

663
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,680
thank you prime minister for uh your

664
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,960
very interesting thoughts i am

665
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:12,078
mikhail troysky from moscow and

666
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,800
my question concerns your assessment

667
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,920
of the current extent and also the

668
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,119
desirable extent of coordination

669
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,680
between the united states and its allies

670
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,200
including australia of their policies

671
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,240
and approaches

672
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,200
vis-a-vis china so do you believe

673
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,078
there's enough

674
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,040
coordination between the united states

675
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,400
on one hand

676
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,400
and european union and australia

677
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,079
on the other hand in their approaches to

678
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,960
dealing with china should that

679
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,440
coordination be stepped up perhaps

680
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,720
or you are just having enough of it

681
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,680
thank you very much

682
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,439
well thank you very much for the

683
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,799
question and my greetings to all of our

684
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,000
friends in mokba

685
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,760
i've been there quite a number of times

686
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,839
and also looking at the question of

687
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,480
russia-china relations as well which i

688
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,680
find

689
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,520
inherently fascinating i think what has

690
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,598
happened is the united states over quite

691
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,599
a long period of time has sought

692
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,400
to coordinate um a general policy on

693
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,839
china

694
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,000
with its allies both in europe and in

695
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,119
asia

696
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,119
but for various reasons various of the

697
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,160
allies have been unwilling to be drawn

698
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,839
into

699
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:32,799
a more generalized u.s

700
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:35,680
china strategic confrontation

701
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,280
not just economic reasons for not

702
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,759
wishing to be so involved

703
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,359
but a range of um foreign policy factors

704
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,000
as well

705
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,960
however what has changed in i think in

706
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,560
the last

707
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,920
year or so has been almost an automatic

708
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,279
reaction against

709
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,160
china by a number of european and

710
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,720
asian democracies in particular as china

711
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,799
has become progressively more assertive

712
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,480
and certainly we saw some signs of that

713
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,599
in 2019

714
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,280
but in 2020 particularly in the covert

715
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,079
world

716
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,640
we've seen an eruption of tensions

717
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,640
between

718
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,680
china and a range of other countries

719
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,440
semi-simultaneously

720
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,879
certainly with the canadians certainly

721
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,359
with the australians

722
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,240
certainly with the japanese and

723
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,119
certainly

724
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,720
in europe with the british and with

725
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,960
others

726
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,759
and the net consequence of all this has

727
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,160
been

728
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,320
that whereas before there may have been

729
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,799
some reluctance on the part of

730
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,359
america's democratic allies to begin to

731
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,160
coordinate policy and strategy

732
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,839
in relation to china china itself by

733
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,040
virtue of the dynamics of its new

734
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,200
assertiveness

735
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,119
are reinforced by what they describe as

736
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,919
its wolf warrior diplomacy

737
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,839
using the chinese term jan lang waijal

738
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,880
has in fact created created its own

739
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,078
reaction

740
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,560
and as a result we now see almost

741
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,400
spontaneously

742
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,560
a greater interest on the part of allies

743
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,280
to have a common script in relation to

744
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,200
china i've observed this myself in the

745
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,680
last six to twelve months

746
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,279
alaskans in particular now where it goes

747
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,598
to in the future

748
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,599
is an open question i think it hangs on

749
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,960
two obvious variables

750
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,480
one if biden wins

751
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,560
that will provide the allies with

752
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,520
greater comfort because the allies have

753
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,720
generally found

754
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,720
trump to be mercurial unpredictable

755
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,240
and generally domestically politically

756
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,319
unacceptable

757
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,839
a biden presidency would be more welcome

758
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,960
and therefore a biden

759
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,720
asked for greater strategic coordination

760
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,680
on china is likely

761
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,439
to be well received but secondly the

762
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,879
other variable is what does the chinese

763
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,359
themselves do

764
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,280
will they adjust their wolf warrior

765
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,359
diplomacy or not

766
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,319
certainly the chinese in the last two to

767
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,078
three weeks

768
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,599
with important speeches by the foreign

769
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,680
minister wang yi

770
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,560
and by the politburo member and former

771
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,078
state councillor yang jia chu

772
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,839
as well as other statements in the

773
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,920
chinese official media

774
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,759
indicate a certain as it were

775
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,960
de-escalation of its wolf warrior

776
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,440
diplomacy

777
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,079
uh at least by several notches will

778
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,760
china continue to do that in order to

779
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,680
as it were de-assertive itself as far as

780
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,440
in which it's seen in other capitals i

781
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,279
don't know but they are the two

782
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,359
variables what happens in washington

783
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,079
and what happens in beijing thank you

784
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,078
for your question

785
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,520
one final question to round off our

786
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,880
discussion

787
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,640
um we've been discussing a lot about um

788
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,920
competition between the united states

789
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,680
and china

790
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,079
but the pandemic has really revealed the

791
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,319
need for more cooperation on the

792
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,400
international stage

793
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,480
which other areas do you think that

794
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,319
china and united states could cooperate

795
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,000
and how could we bridge relations

796
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,000
between the two through cooperation

797
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,319
well it in the future

798
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,240
in terms of the overall dynamics of the

799
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,800
u.s china relationship

800
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,319
in my argument it would fall within a

801
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,920
number of categories there are going to

802
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,040
be those areas of

803
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,920
direct confrontation where red lines

804
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,079
will be drawn

805
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,440
and red lines sought to be enforced and

806
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,200
those difficult and potentially

807
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,520
dangerous areas will continue

808
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,520
and i think we know what that list is

809
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,160
but there'll be also other areas of what

810
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,880
i describe as strategic competition

811
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,000
where the two systems will be not just

812
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,839
competing against each other

813
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
ideologically but competing in foreign

814
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,759
policy terms and economic terms

815
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,640
etc but all against the overall matrix

816
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,599
of a

817
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,118
competition of power but then you come

818
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,800
to the third category which you've just

819
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,119
referred to which is where it's still in

820
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,119
both countries interests

821
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,359
and their national interests to find

822
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,359
areas of collaboration

823
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,359
for example in the old cold war between

824
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,119
the us and the soviet union

825
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,160
soviets in the americans found common

826
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:05,119
cause in various significant

827
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,118
arms control agreements even in areas of

828
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,440
global public health

829
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,359
at the time with polio outbreaks etc

830
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,760
there was collaboration

831
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,560
so for the future where would i see that

832
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,599
lying

833
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,319
certainly under a democrat

834
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,160
administration one a more effective

835
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,599
approach to pandemic management

836
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,520
between china and the united states

837
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,200
and rather than playing the blame game i

838
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,079
think there'd be a predisposition to get

839
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,919
on with it

840
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,760
find the vaccine declare it a global

841
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,760
public good and get it out there as

842
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,920
quickly as possible

843
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,800
i think secondly climate change

844
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,200
collaboration

845
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,640
uh will be critical uh these are the

846
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,240
world's two largest emitters of

847
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,480
greenhouse gases

848
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,359
uh and the impact of extreme weather

849
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,280
events

850
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,598
uh look at the floods and almost

851
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,839
unprecedented floods in western china

852
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,839
but what's happened to chongqing uh look

853
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,599
what's happening with the wildfires and

854
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,720
currently in the west coast

855
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,560
the unprecedented storm intensities now

856
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,959
coming in on the atlantic coast

857
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,480
wildfires in australia similarly what's

858
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,920
happening in the russian federation and

859
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,240
elsewhere in the world

860
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,920
i think these global planetary factors

861
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,799
will bring these two countries together

862
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,359
as well

863
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,560
with focused climate collaboration third

864
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,799
possibility

865
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,920
maybe they will be be able to get across

866
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,400
the threshold

867
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,079
and begin to look at various levels of

868
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,480
arms control as well

869
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,400
for example in the new generation of

870
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,800
artificial intelligence driven

871
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,240
robotic warfare so there are three

872
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,920
potential areas for

873
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,919
let's call it a collaborative approach

874
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,599
mr kevin rodd thank you very much for

875
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,720
your time and for your

876
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:50,400
very informative answers

877
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:53,200
good to be with you on this program

878
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,960
even prior to the coronavirus pandemic

879
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,680
the u.s china's tensions

880
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,000
have spilled over into global trade and

881
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,000
heightened political confrontations

882
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
in addition to president trump's trade

883
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,880
war the u.s has repeatedly

884
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,520
condemned chinese track record on human

885
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,680
rights

886
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,680
and upped its military presence in the

887
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,598
south pacific

888
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,040
the relationship is at a low point

889
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,599
probably the lowest

890
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,440
since the u.s formally recognized china

891
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,599
in the 1970s

892
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,000
the big question is whether or not we

893
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,079
will see a further deterioration

894
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,160
or there is a chance to salvage this

895
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,720
relationship

896
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,560
as the world's largest economies and two

897
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,279
military superpowers

898
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,319
this question has ramifications beyond

899
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,599
their diplomatic

900
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:42,560
posturing the eu is often

901
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,440
caught in the middle and that's due on

902
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,599
one hand

903
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,599
to a lack of coherent foreign policy

904
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,520
when it comes to beijing

905
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,520
you consider china both a partner a

906
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,000
competitor or strategic rival

907
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,520
pointing at beijing's treatment or

908
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,920
unfair treatment when it comes to

909
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,119
european multinational corporations

910
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,960
and lack of access on one hand and their

911
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,760
anti-democratic governance structures on

912
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,480
the other

913
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,319
but in the same time struggles to find

914
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,760
the perfect middle ground to cooperate

915
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:13,040
with china

916
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,000
the eu has reached across the pond to

917
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,920
try to find ways

918
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
to work with the united states when it

919
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,240
comes to the relationship with beijing

920
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,720
but the low tide in the transatlantic

921
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,879
relationship might have a say

922
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,959
the big question moving forward is how

923
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,839
we will be able to ensure

924
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,040
that we are not moving towards an

925
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,960
escalation

926
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,279
of this conflict into something that

927
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,480
will have global consequences

928
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,280
and how we will be able as transatlantic

929
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,000
partners

930
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:55,860
to work with china without sacrificing

931
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:56,300
our liberal values

932
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,390

welcome back to the second day of the

938
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,118
globsic digital stage

939
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,759
my name is alina kutzko and i'm director

940
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:32,240
of the globsec policy institute

941
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,680
i'm very delighted to start the day with

942
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,160
the topic that goes

943
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,480
into the core of the discussion about

944
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,000
how the global system is structured

945
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,240
what are the ways in which it is

946
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,319
arranged and what is the current and

947
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,879
developing balance of power between

948
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,079
various

949
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,000
actors from climate change to trade to

950
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,240
pandemic to security

951
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
the debate about the future of relations

952
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,240
between the countries globally

953
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,319
is very much underway and we're very

954
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,118
happy today to contribute to this

955
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,359
discussion

956
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,040
and today debates on the constructive

957
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,839
way to move forward

958
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:08,079
for this purpose with me here today are

959
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,240

961
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,160
transatlantic fellow

962

much for joining

972
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,799
we purposefully and i admit slightly

973
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,920
provocatively

974
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,720
titled this session trends china's

975
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,680
continued rise versus america's relative

976
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,480
decline

977
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,879
we also encourage our participants to be

978
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,119
very

979
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,200
open very honest and in a way

980
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,400
provocative and ask our speakers

981
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,960
challenging questions

982
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,960
as we aim to find very honest and

983
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,160
constructive answers to the pertinent

984
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,640
topics

985
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,799
i will start with andrew and ask him to

986
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,118
be the first to address the question

987
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,520
that concerns everybody today there has

988
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:12,640
been a lot of discussion that covet 19

989
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,720
has been some kind of a great excellent

990
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,118
accelerator that highlighted and

991
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,520
overcharged the nascent trends rather

992
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,920
than developed something new

993
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,079
andrew does the same dictum applied to

994
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,000
the global power relations

995
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,000
how do you assess the change of global

996
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,839
power balance that is happening during

997
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,839
this poverty 19 times

998
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,920
thanks very much alina and thanks for

999
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,558
the chance to to join this

1000
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,640
session today at globe sec and so i

1001
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,800
think you can begin by analyzing this

1002
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,319
um through the economic prism of course

1003
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,040
and what this does to the distribution

1004
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,240
of power

1005
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,640
as a result of the covert 19 pandemic

1006
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,759
china was of course hit first has

1007
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,118
recovered first

1008
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,559
a number of the other asia pacific

1009
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,040
countries that were hit in the first

1010
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,160
phase

1011
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,400
two and generally dealt with the

1012
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,680
pandemic very well are also recovering

1013
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,079
relatively quickly

1014
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,240
the us even now has failed to get a grip

1015
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,240
on the pandemic really at all

1016
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,160
europe was hit even harder than both the

1017
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,160
us and china economically

1018
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,759
um but it's forecast to bounce back at

1019
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,160
least more strongly than the united

1020
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,880
states

1021
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,598
in 2021 and of course the the very

1022
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,319
ambitious

1023
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,119
even uh transformative recovery plan

1024
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,839
given the new

1025
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,599
um uh debt issuance mechanism and that's

1026
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,400
really just to talk about the economies

1027
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,319
and regions

1028
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,720
that have the wherewithal to take on

1029
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,960
debt and to finance a recovery

1030
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,480
a lot of the developing world is really

1031
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,079
going to struggle in the next period and

1032
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,240
we haven't got anywhere

1033
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,280
close i would say to to a comprehensive

1034
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,279
settlement there

1035
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,400
um even with the short-term agreement at

1036
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,079
the g20

1037
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,160
including with a lot of the cases where

1038
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,160
china is now a major creditor

1039
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,839
but i think beyond some of the things

1040
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,598
that we can debate about the

1041
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,720
short to medium-term economic trajectory

1042
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,839
and what that will do to the power

1043
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,399
balance

1044
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,200
i think we have to look at the views

1045
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,720
that are

1046
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,558
that have developed of of the different

1047
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,598
powers and and how they've handled the

1048
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,440
the crisis

1049
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,960
um where i think the picture in europe

1050
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,319
has been quite mixed

1051
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,160
um i think the us uh certainly taken

1052
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,400
kind of a reputational hit for its

1053
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,558
handling of the of the pandemic

1054
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,920
but i think what's going on with china's

1055
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,240
reputation through this

1056
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,400
is likely to be longer lasting um than

1057
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,879
that um i'm not necessarily talking

1058
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,160
about

1059
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,480
the handling of the outbreak in in wuhan

1060
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,839
of course um significant culpability in

1061
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,440
the chinese system for the fact that it

1062
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,279
wasn't contained at that point

1063
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,640
um but i think the legacy that we're

1064
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,000
likely to see of this kind of

1065
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,078
turbocharged assertiveness that has

1066
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,319
played out through the pandemic

1067
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,520
just to kind of run through a few of the

1068
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,359
most obvious cases

1069
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,720
the economic coercion of australia that

1070
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,040
we're seeing even now

1071
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,319
military incidents with vietnam japan

1072
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,400
and taiwan

1073
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,960
uh the worst border altercation that

1074
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,359
we've seen with india really in decades

1075
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,559
all of the wolf warrior diplomacy in

1076
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,960
europe in brazil

1077
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,880
in other cases uh what's played out with

1078
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,040
the hong kong national security law

1079
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,000
uh the treatment of african nationals in

1080
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,000
guangzhou

1081
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,119
and that's just to do a kind of you know

1082
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,040
very short list of

1083
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,720
of some of what's of of what's played

1084
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,200
out just in the last few months

1085
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,759
uh alone um i think the result of a lot

1086
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,839
of this

1087
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,160
is that you're getting a long list of

1088
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,319
countries that are in the process now

1089
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,279
uh of of going through a pretty serious

1090
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,680
rethink of their

1091
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,520
relations with china uh some of which

1092
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,118
was already in motion some of which has

1093
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,319
as you suggested in your question

1094
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:31,440
been kind of accelerated by the crisis

1095
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:32,240
whether it's india australia canada the

1096
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,720
uk

1097
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,399
a lot of europe and that adds of course

1098
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,078
to the places where we'd already seen a

1099
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,559
big briefing taking place in recent

1100
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,520
years

1101
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,960
united states japan and so on and what

1102
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,880
we're seeing in most places

1103
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,880
is more of an emphasis on competition

1104
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,960
and in some cases rivalry

1105
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,200
and i think kind of a pairing back of

1106
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,680
some of the areas of cooperation that

1107
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,598
were

1108
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,680
envisaged and to some extent a more

1109
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,480
ideological quality being being taken on

1110
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,759
as as was

1111
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,760
sort of suggested a little bit in the

1112
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,720
introduction to this panel

1113
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,880
and this is really happening

1114
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,720
simultaneously across a whole range of

1115
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,440
different countries and regions

1116
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,160
and the big risk that china faces uh in

1117
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,720
all of this

1118
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,520
is uh even with its continued economic

1119
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,839
success

1120
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,000
uh the the potential for a kind of

1121
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,720
countervailing coalition to rise as a

1122
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,119
result

1123
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,078
um and still even with the troubles that

1124
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,240
the united states

1125
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,160
has faced in the last period of time the

1126
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,000
biggest asset that the u.s still has

1127
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,759
if it can take advantage of it which has

1128
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,640
not been able to really in the last few

1129
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,079
years

1130
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,879
is that its network of partners and

1131
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,040
allies still completely dwarfs

1132
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,800
in economic technological and military

1133
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,759
power anything that china is able to

1134
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,760
stitch together

1135
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,079
and still really has tremendous leverage

1136
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,559
to set rules to exert pressure

1137
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,680
um and to construct new structures of

1138
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,920
interaction with

1139
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,040
uh with the various parties um among its

1140
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,720
partners and allies

1141
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,558
um with each other in you know for

1142
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,319
instance technology and data

1143
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,079
that effectively cut china out of some

1144
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,440
of these important areas

1145
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,599
and i'd say particularly if you have a

1146
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,280
change in administration on the u.s side

1147
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,040
you're likely to see a lot more of this

1148
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,400
kind of coalition building

1149
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,440
vis-a-vis china and that will in part be

1150
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,720
a legacy

1151
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:13,760
of how china has handled the crisis both

1152
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,720
in its immediate manifestation in china

1153
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,240
but as much how china has behaved in its

1154
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,439
economic diplomatic military

1155
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:24,078
assertiveness

1156
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:26,240
throughout the crisis

1157
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,760
thank you so much andrew for unpacking a

1158
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,200
whole bunch of issues that i'm sure

1159
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,800
we'll touch upon later

1160
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,399
and i want to proceed connect what

1161
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,640
you're saying also to

1162
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,480
bradley and bradley your discussion with

1163
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,078
the honorary kevin rudd

1164
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,000
i remember you asked him a question at

1165
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,200
the beginning that the u.s and china

1166
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,520
relations seem to be

1167
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,359
spiraling out of control i want to ask

1168
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,160
you the same question what is your take

1169
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,920
on that

1170
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,520
and whether there is a qualitative

1171
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,760
change in the relations

1172
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,480
between us and china but also us a

1173
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:58,400
chinese position globally in the world

1174
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,400
in the aftermath of the covet 19.

1175
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,000
i think there's been a huge shift in uf

1176
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,720
rhetoric and outlook

1177
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,200
toward china we've of course had decades

1178
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,520
um based on the assumption that

1179
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,799
cooperation trade with china would

1180
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,119
eventually lead to

1181
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,880
a systemic shift within china itself or

1182
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,760
more liberalization of its political

1183
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,240
system

1184
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,040
there seems to be a growing consensus

1185
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,720
within the u.s

1186
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,640
especially that that that hasn't been

1187
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,160
the case and the china is now framed as

1188
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,558
a major challenger

1189
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,558
a systemic rival at that with a

1190
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:34,799
different um

1191
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:37,200
political economic and ethical um

1192
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,559
structure that challenges the us um

1193
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,480
liberal order

1194
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,480
so now this challenger rhetoric has

1195
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,920
really become the centerpiece um of how

1196
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,839
we think about relations

1197
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,760
and to speak to some of what andrew was

1198
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,839
saying it seems that

1199
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,160
the pandemic has actually acted as an

1200
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:55,359
accelerator where we're seeing

1201
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,440
um now even the response to the pandemic

1202
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:58,558
itself was presented in competitive

1203
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,040
terms

1204
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,359
the china model versus the us model

1205
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:06,000
china model taking a lot of

1206
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:08,078
global criticism of course for the

1207
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,400
initial cover-up of information

1208
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,720
and the delayed response to the virus

1209
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,960
which allowed it to become pandemic

1210
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,000
to begin with but also in terms of the

1211
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,880
us which has also

1212
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,440
been slow to respond and has taken a

1213
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,640
large

1214
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,880
economic hit china has been placed in a

1215
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,200
very difficult position

1216
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,799
and will continue to be for the the near

1217
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,040
future

1218
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,640
both in terms of dealing with um

1219
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:36,240
criticism

1220
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,000
um labeled out with um regard to his

1221
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,078
handling of the crisis

1222
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,040
but also with the belt road project

1223
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,400
which has been

1224
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,720
the major flagship um

1225
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,760
chinese initiative on the global stage

1226
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,558
now we're going to see

1227
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,079
a lot more as economies around the world

1228
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,280
are facing a lot of strain they're going

1229
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,920
to struggle to

1230
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,240
pay back these chinese loans which is

1231
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,000
only going to enhance

1232
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,680
the criticism of china and chinese

1233
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,280
foreign policy that's been labeled for

1234
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,240
years now which is this idea that

1235
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,319
china's launching debt trap diplomacy

1236
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,558
this idea that china will

1237
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:12,480
in debt countries and then seize

1238
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,200
strategic assets from the whether it be

1239
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,440
ports

1240
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:18,160
or gold mines in the case of central

1241
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,559
asian countries such as purity's down

1242
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,680
this places china a difficult spot where

1243
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,839
it will need to

1244
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:27,839
collect its debts back in order not to

1245
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:30,000
for his projects to

1246
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:32,319
suffer too much economically but at the

1247
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,480
same time it would be a pr

1248
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:36,558
issue for china to be bridging relations

1249
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,880
with these countries and then to claim

1250
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,400
such assets so this is going to be

1251
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,599
difficult as navigating the belt and

1252
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,040
road in the long run

1253
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,760
um we'll probably see a shift in china's

1254
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,359
strategy

1255
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,559
of more a more focused belt and road

1256
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,680
project where there's going to be a lot

1257
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,400
more

1258
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,160
scrutiny over investments a lot of

1259
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,760
efforts to try and avoid these so-called

1260
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:01,118
white elephant projects

1261
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:03,280
um seem to have no economic value

1262
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,839
so in some ways i think the the belt and

1263
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,839
road as being the major flagship

1264
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,839
aspect of competition between the us and

1265
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:12,480
china globally

1266
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,480
we could see china retrenching almost

1267
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,520
focusing on core areas

1268
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:22,960
and having a more rational allocation of

1269
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:25,359
resources with regard to that

1270
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,960
thank you so much bradley and uh i would

1271
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:29,279
like to ask now ms

1272
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,240
jean-liquid to respond to the previous

1273
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,000
speakers

1274
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,680
there's we can definitely sense that

1275
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,799
there is a much more

1276
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,919
awareness and even concern in the west

1277
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,960
about the rise of china how does it seem

1278
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,599
from beijing

1279
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,880
and how do you see the change in the

1280
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,319
power dynamics

1281
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,319
in the global system now

1282
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,480
okay thank you very much for your

1283
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,599
inviting me

1284
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:59,119
and your software arrangement

1285
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:02,960
for this event i want to talk about

1286
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:07,520
how high commander 919

1287
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:10,880
impact the distribution of power

1288
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:14,160
globally some people think

1289
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:17,680
that the chronomers

1290
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:21,279
has affected the global distribution

1291
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:25,359
of power china is getting stronger

1292
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:28,559
and in comparison the united stand

1293
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:32,480
is in decline the world is

1294
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:36,480
forming a bipolar system

1295
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:40,319
between the u.s and china i disagree

1296
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:43,920
with this view i don't think

1297
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:47,359
that convention 19 will fundamentally

1298
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:51,040
change the global distribution of power

1299
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:54,960
the u.s is still

1300
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:58,480
the only civil power in the world

1301
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:02,160
and the eu russia china

1302
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,119
other major powers although china is

1303
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,879
rising

1304
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:10,000
china has no intention to challenge

1305
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:14,319
the statue of u.s and

1306
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,000
no intention of changing u.s positive

1307
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:21,759
position in a world of complaining

1308
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,440
with the us for global heightenment

1309
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,440
since the command 19

1310
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,839
pandemic

1311
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,119
administration has described it to china

1312
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:49,440
and

1313
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:53,599
extern a full run of extreme

1314
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:57,200
pressure on china china is owning curry

1315
01:00:53,599 --> 01:01:00,400
out self-defense

1316
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:03,598
measures china has been talked to

1317
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,400
the us for continued cooperation and the

1318
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,640
mutual

1319
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:12,079
benefit china pursues the principle of

1320
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:15,200
harmony with different this means

1321
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:18,799
that even though i

1322
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:21,839
cooperation with you i have my own

1323
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:24,960
ability and i don't follow you

1324
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:28,160
in everything if think

1325
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:31,760
if i think you did it right

1326
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:34,960
i agree and if you do it wrong

1327
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:38,079
i still put forward a different

1328
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:42,960
opening therefore in china will not

1329
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:46,000
stand on the opposite side of the u.s

1330
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:49,680
uh from another competition

1331
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,200
group to establish the bipolar

1332
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:56,960
world therefore there will be

1333
01:01:53,200 --> 01:02:00,799
no fundamental change in the

1334
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:04,079
current international structure

1335
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:08,160
of one superpower and

1336
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:10,640
multiple major power this is my idea

1337
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,640
thank you

1338
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:16,399
thank you so much for explaining some

1339
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,240
issues that we've been struggling with

1340
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,160
and i would like to start with a second

1341
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,598
question and go back to andrew andrew

1342
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,598
you mentioned a lot the

1343
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,200
value of the partnership and coalition

1344
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:28,000
building in these times

1345
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,919
and i'm wondering how the relations

1346
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,280
between the united states europe and

1347
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,880
china could look like

1348
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,200
because we know that even relations

1349
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,680
between the eu and u.s have not been the

1350
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,839
most

1351
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,279
stable definitely they are good but

1352
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,640
there are certain frictions

1353
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,559
and there are definitely different

1354
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,319
levels of relations between the eu and

1355
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,240
china and the us and china

1356
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:48,480
could you untangle that a little bit and

1357
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,558
maybe also mention which errors could be

1358
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,960
the areas of strategic partnerships

1359
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,599
and in which era specifically still the

1360
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,960
three

1361
01:02:53,599 --> 01:03:00,480
uh centers of the relations are still

1362
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,480
seeing each other as competitors

1363
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,839
sure um well maybe i'm starting with

1364
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,599
with with the us dimension and

1365
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,880
again we're a few months out from an

1366
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,880
election so

1367
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,000
we know in principle the trajectory that

1368
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,760
things are headed

1369
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,760
on under the trump administration that

1370
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,920
we might expect to continue

1371
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,839
i think on the u.s china front we'd

1372
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,680
probably see things stabilize a bit if

1373
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:25,038
there's a change in administration

1374
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,000
uh in a few areas less arbitrary use of

1375
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,480
tariffs

1376
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
language would be less confrontational

1377
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,079
and there'd be some attempts to resume

1378
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,119
cooperation in at least a couple of

1379
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:34,960
areas such as

1380
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,480
uh climate if you had a biden

1381
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,760
administration um

1382
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,440
but as i suggested in in the first um

1383
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,520
part of the discussion um i think

1384
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,240
abiding administration would also see

1385
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,400
a far more serious push to join forces

1386
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,479
with allies on china with the europeans

1387
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,160
in a very very central role

1388
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,319
and i think the prospects of that

1389
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,839
happening and happening seriously

1390
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:59,759
would be much more likely if you did see

1391
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:01,200
a change in in administration

1392
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,920
um and i think it will be one of the

1393
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:06,319
major priorities for um

1394
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,920
uh for abiding administration and in the

1395
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:10,319
transatlantic relationship

1396
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,000
um uh if you do get um a change in the

1397
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,759
elections in in november

1398
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,760
and then on the u.s china side i think

1399
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,280
most of the fundamental areas that

1400
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,200
where competition has accelerated in the

1401
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,079
last few years economic

1402
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,279
technological uh even ideological uh

1403
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,280
military was

1404
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,720
was always there before um or at least

1405
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,960
in the last couple of decades

1406
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,919
all of that will continue um i think the

1407
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,359
european case

1408
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:36,720
is is is is a more complex case

1409
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:38,000
um we've seen clearly a shift in views

1410
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,879
in europe in the last

1411
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,920
few years bradley referenced the the

1412
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,559
concept of

1413
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,200
uh systemic rival which the eu has

1414
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,520
started

1415
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,319
um talking about um just in the last uh

1416
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,880
two years

1417
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,599
um and i think you've seen this move in

1418
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,240
europe

1419
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,079
um particularly on the economic side

1420
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,640
towards a view that says that the level

1421
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:58,960
of

1422
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,078
asymmetric openness between europe and

1423
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,799
china where

1424
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,000
china is relatively closed to european

1425
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:06,880
companies

1426
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and europe is relatively open to china

1427
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,760
in all sorts of ways

1428
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,359
has to be rebalanced there needs to be

1429
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,839
greater reciprocity

1430
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:15,520
and that europe needs to get some new

1431
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,160
tools in place to be able to deal with

1432
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,000
all of this

1433
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,759
uh more effectively um and i think

1434
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,520
you've started to see as well

1435
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,200
and particularly as the kind of

1436
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,119
prominence of china in the european

1437
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,759
political debates has has gone up

1438
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,359
uh much more emphasis on a lot of the

1439
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,280
values questions that had

1440
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:33,038
almost been buried in the relationship

1441
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,000
for a while particularly as some of

1442
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,960
those values

1443
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,359
questions start to affect uh things at

1444
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,680
home

1445
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,480
in europe and 5g was a big example of

1446
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,839
that where

1447
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,760
um i think when you're talking about

1448
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:46,720
data security privacy and

1449
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,240
and so in in europe itself um that in

1450
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,279
addition to all the questions around for

1451
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,759
instance hong kong

1452
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,599
and starts to raise the salience of um

1453
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,480
of of the values dynamics in in the

1454
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,799
europe china

1455
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,880
um relationship um but i think europa

1456
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,680
had still really wanted and still wants

1457
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,000
to find

1458
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,720
a fairly substantial set of areas of

1459
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,799
partnership with

1460
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,839
with china um but i think they just

1461
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,680
haven't been

1462
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:09,759
getting anywhere uh with with that in

1463
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,960
the last period of time

1464
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,240
i think europeans would like an

1465
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,760
investment agreement that provides

1466
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,558
better market access and investment

1467
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,319
protection

1468
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,720
they'd like an agreement that sees china

1469
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:20,160
taking on more ambitious climate targets

1470
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,160
um even on the belton road i think

1471
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,839
they'd like to be able to cooperate on

1472
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,839
high standard infrastructure in africa

1473
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:27,920
and elsewhere and but these

1474
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:29,359
can't just be kind of theoretical areas

1475
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,799
where it would be good if the two sides

1476
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:32,558
were able to work together

1477
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:34,319
i think the sense on the european side

1478
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,119
and even for the biggest advocates of

1479
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,799
the partnership

1480
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,720
uh is they've been trying again and

1481
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:39,200
again and and really getting nowhere on

1482
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,118
this

1483
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,879
um and so i think even on some of the

1484
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:45,280
areas of potential cooperation

1485
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,319
i wouldn't be surprised if they took on

1486
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,000
didn't take on a more kind of

1487
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,799
competitive quality as well so for

1488
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,640
instance

1489
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:52,400
climate cooperation yes i think that

1490
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,160
will continue to be a priority but

1491
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,400
you know with a carbon border adjustment

1492
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,799
mechanism or other sorts of steps

1493
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,559
trade cooperation yes but with stronger

1494
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:02,079
tools to go off the chinese subsidies

1495
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,039
and force reciprocity

1496
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,920
uh belt and road cooperation also would

1497
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,760
continue but

1498
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,359
i think with more of a push um to

1499
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,079
provide high standard alternatives for

1500
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,000
countries

1501
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,119
and to go after unfair competition with

1502
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,880
with chinese firms

1503
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,640
and so i think the sentiment in europe

1504
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,240
as well is that even some of the areas

1505
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:21,200
of potential partnership

1506
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,240
are taking on a different quality uh now

1507
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,319
as a result of

1508
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,839
of kind of this continued kind of

1509
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:27,279
bashing against the brick wall that's

1510
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:30,558
been going on with china

1511
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,559
in in the last few years

1512
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,799
thank you so much andrew and uh that

1513
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,280
seems to me like a good timing to go

1514
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,559
back to

1515
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,640
miss jean vichua also uh in your

1516
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,280
assessment whether you agree with andrew

1517
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,000
on his

1518
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,200
division between which eras currently

1519
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,160
give the biggest promise for the

1520
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,480
partnership

1521
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,480
and which errors were still competitors

1522
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,760
uh i want to talk about the second

1523
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:02,000
question okay

1524
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:06,319
uh how can the u.s eu china

1525
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,319
a triangle perfection okay

1526
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:14,640
may i go ahead absolutely

1527
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,640
yes

1528
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:22,158
china and the year share many

1529
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:25,439
uh coming interesting the eu

1530
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:27,120
is china's largest country partner and

1531
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:31,040
the trainer is the eu's

1532
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:34,158
second the largest uh training partner

1533
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:37,519
so i think china and the eu

1534
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:41,439
have similar outlook on global

1535
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:44,640
governance already issued the great

1536
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:47,919
potential of diversity partnership

1537
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:52,159
between china and the eu for example

1538
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:56,040
global governance environmental

1539
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:58,399
protection a nuclear

1540
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:03,359
non-proliferation oppose the

1541
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:07,679
armories advocating uh multiliterally

1542
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:12,880
and promoting the world a multi-product

1543
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:12,880
structure and so on since the

1544
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,159
dynamic the relationship between china

1545
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:22,000
and the eu

1546
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:24,238
have become closer than before

1547
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,920
the leader of china and the european

1548
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,959
health exchange

1549

1560
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:09,599
in the world regarding china

1561
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:13,199
as a strategic competitor

1562
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:16,800
or even an enemy this is a

1563
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:20,320
actually misperception

1564
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:23,600
about china china is a socialist

1565
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:27,280
country it's true

1566
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,920
but it is the resentful peace and the

1567
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:31,199
harmony

1568
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,000
country and a chinese tradition cultural

ratchetness courtesy wisdom

1572
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,800

01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,239
the chinese people

1574
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:51,199
and the chinese leader and the

1575
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:51,839
chinese foreign policy the sort of

1576
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:55,040
harmony

1577
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:58,960
terrors to those things with companies

1578
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:02,719
face of justice honesty and

1579
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:06,000
trustworthiness modesty and protest

1580
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:09,600
as well as respect for others this

1581
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:13,040
philosophy also tells

1582
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:16,400
that too much is as bad as

1583
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:19,679
too little since

1584
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,080
speaking hard money would hurt would

1585
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,360
harm

1586
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:26,559
chinese net national interest and even

1587
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:29,679
pleasure neither tool is

1588
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,280
that for a resident china will never try

1589
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:34,960
to domination

1590
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:37,519
the world there are

1591
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:40,239
there are numbers examples showing the

1592
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:43,760
difference of harmony then in

1593
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:47,120
history in fact china is an

1594
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:50,640
important force that helped

1595
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:53,679
maintain the u.s superpowers leaders

1596
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,719
cannot help with human resources

1597
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,679
underwears china is the world's largest

1598
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:00,480
formatted

1599
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,199
especially as the largest consumer

1600
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,799
market

1601
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:08,320
for agriculture and technology products

1602
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:11,520
from the us chinese

1603
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,239
students scientists and engineers are

1604
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:17,199
also

1605
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:20,639
the backbone of american laboratories

1606
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:24,000
additionally americans

1607
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:28,679
have benefited from the signal u.s feed

1608
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:32,560
by enjoying quality and in expressive

1609
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:33,600
communities from china china hope to

1610
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,480
continue

1611
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,120
it's all around the cooperation with the

1612
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:41,000
u.s

1613
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:42,400
as before however the tribal

1614
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,760
administration's

1615
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:49,519
extreme press on china has

1616
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:53,760
undermined 10 u.s cooperation

1617
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:57,840
the number is changing

1618
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,840
this is this is my idea thank you

1619
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:03,120
thank you so much for the comprehensive

1620
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,120
response and we have already a few

1621
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,679
questions from the audience being lined

1622
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,360
up

1623
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:11,520
so i'm going to bring in the first

1624
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:11,519
participant video to ask the question

1625
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:16,239
uh good afternoon hello esteemed speaker

1626
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,719
andrew hilton the defense

1627
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:20,400
uh security fellow at globe sec uh

1628
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:22,239
ingredients from vienna

1629
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,080
building on what andrew smalls small

1630
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:26,239
mentioned earlier about allies

1631
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:27,360
wangi china's foreign minister begins

1632
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,959
his tour of europe

1633
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,799
apparently on a platform of jump

1634
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,320
starting the global economy and working

1635
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,480
on multilateralism

1636
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,280
minister yi will visit italy the

1637
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,959
netherlands norway france and germany

1638
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,800
all countries that secretary of state

1639
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,159
mike pompeo didn't visit on his last

1640
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,239
european mission

1641
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:46,159
so specifically to andrew what can

1642
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:47,678
china's top diplomat realistically

1643
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:49,280
expect with these meetings given the

1644
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:51,199
reshuffling of both the internal

1645
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,559
political dynamics in these capitals as

1646
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,919
well as the lingering burn of the

1647
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,239
pandemic

1648
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,440
from my mind things like his ability to

1649
01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:01,280
offset america's full-court press on 5g

1650
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,559
obviously skating the organization of an

1651
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,559
independent commission

1652
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,719
or even potentially avoiding the hostile

1653
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,520
takeover of tick tock on european soil

1654
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,159
comes to mind

1655
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,159
thank you very much

1656
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:16,000
thank you very much roger i actually

1657
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,360
will ask bradley to answer the question

1658
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,360
first and then go to andrew

1659
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,239
sure thank you um for that question

1660
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,199
um i think it speaks more broadly i mean

1661
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:31,199
to frame that

1662
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:33,199
question within the previous one which

1663
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:36,879
is about the role of the european union

1664
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:38,799
um in general between um

1665
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,080
the u.s and china you know europe is

1666
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,080
often the forgotten

1667
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,440
actor within these uh bifurcated

1668
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,239
relations you know even

1669
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,879
with the cold war forget that europe was

1670
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,879
actually

1671
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,719
an actor throughout the cold war and

1672
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,719
actually exercised the moderating

1673
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,000
influence on both the us and the soviet

1674
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:57,600
union at the time

1675
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:02,320
i think europe can also revive that role

1676
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:04,480
um today and it's um as a relations um

1677
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:06,559
decline between the us and china there

1678
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,199
are a lot of grounds where

1679
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,080
europe and china have a lot in common

1680
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:13,199
for example

1681
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:15,679
the regard to climate change um the

1682
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:18,400
criticism that launched against the us

1683
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,920
um position on climate change under the

1684
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,799
current administration

1685
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,440
that's just one example where europe

1686
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,679
aligns

1687
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,639
um with china and also in terms of

1688
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:29,920
criticizing

1689
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:32,080
u.s foreign policy over the years so

1690
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,960
it's not a simple i think at the times

1691
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,120
the u.s

1692
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,800
takes europe for granted i mean that's

1693
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,640
part of the question here when you're

1694
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,880
mentioning a pompeo didn't visit certain

1695
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,280
states it's true that with the way the

1696
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,440
us

1697
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,960
talks about europe it's almost assumed

1698
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:48,239
that europe will always be

1699
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:51,760
um on the us side um

1700
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:54,080
of this debate but that isn't the case

1701
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,000
although as we're seeing the eu europe

1702
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,559
um is also becoming more critical of

1703
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,280
china

1704
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:01,520
um in recent years i mean again

1705
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:06,080
referring to china as a systemic

1706
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:10,400
rival so in that sense china

1707
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,400
has really tried to work um

1708
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,960
to change the european perspective and

1709
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,280
we've seen forums such as the 17

1710
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,800
1 format where we've um had china

1711
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:21,440
bridging its relations with

1712
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,040
the countries of eastern europe um some

1713
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,639
commentators say that it's exploiting

1714
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,519
division within the european union

1715
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,159
others would say

1716
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,360
that china is merely building its

1717
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:32,320
relations with

1718
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,960
um former allies during the cold war the

1719
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,679
former

1720
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,760
communist states so in that sense it's

1721
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:41,440
really leveraging as historic ties

1722
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:45,679
in connections um in europe to

1723
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:49,199
pursue important strategic ends

1724
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,080
now for the current um discussion

1725
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:53,839
especially with

1726
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,559
5g infrastructure um that's another one

1727
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,400
that's been

1728
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,920
a complex debate especially if you look

1729
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,799
at germany often

1730
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,480
some of the discussion has been you know

1731
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,960
china may exploit

1732
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:08,639
um some of this technology um

1733
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,719
in a way that undermines our national

1734
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,480
security but they would some critics in

1735
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,880
germany in opposition would point at the

1736
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,000
us and with the revelations the nsa and

1737
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,320
snowden

1738
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,120
um which has created some interesting

1739
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,920
debates

1740
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:24,159
where it's kind of been this realistic

1741
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,800
that both actors are actually exploiting

1742
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:26,719
our uh

1743
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,400
information infrastructure so we might

1744
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,159
as well go with the cheapest one

1745
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,679
and that's at least what some opposition

1746
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:33,440
politicians have been

1747
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:37,760
um pointing out but that's a good

1748
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:39,440
example of where u.s policy has actually

1749
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,080
been short-termist and actually

1750
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,839
undermine some of its long-term

1751
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,280
credibility so there needs to be more of

1752
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,400
an adjustment the u.s part

1753
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,199
um to you know upholding uh these

1754
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,040
principles

1755
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,719
um if it's to be an effective competitor

1756
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,840
against um

1757
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:59,600
china uh for europeans but

1758
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,760
largely um even staunch british even

1759
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,920
staunch allies of china such as the

1760
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,000
united kingdom have come out in recent

1761
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,199
years being more critical of china so

1762
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,920
there's definitely

1763
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:11,759
a shift and it will really depend on you

1764
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,520
know the incoming u.s administration

1765
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:16,400
will it whether we'll

1766
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,520
seek to reconnect with europe and it's

1767
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,159
european allies

1768
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,679
or whether it will continue its um what

1769
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:27,599
seems to be more of an independent

1770
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:29,440
course for euros foreign

1771
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,520
thank you so much bradley uh and the

1772
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:35,199
same question goes to andrew especially

1773
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,199
with the focus on the visit to europe

1774
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,639
yeah sure thanks thanks for the question

1775
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,920
um so

1776
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,640
i think uh wangy's visit is part damage

1777
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,840
limitation

1778
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,920
exercise and partly preparation for

1779
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,360
the fact that um xi jinping will be

1780
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,679
speaking to

1781
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,519
the european union leadership and

1782
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:56,000
chancellor merkel in the middle of

1783
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,800
september um it's damage limitation

1784
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,920
because

1785
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:03,520
um i think there has been some surprise

1786
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,640
on the chinese side um how badly things

1787
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,400
have been going with

1788
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,480
with europe in in recent months i think

1789
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,159
the way the eu china summit

1790
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,759
uh played out in june was it was a

1791
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:15,040
little bit of a uh

1792
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,719
shock um the very kind of blunt language

1793
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,800
used particularly by

1794
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:20,000
european commission president uh

1795
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,400
underlying um

1796
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,239
and the fact that essentially uh all the

1797
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,920
things that might have been agreed on a

1798
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:28,879
kind of future cooperation agreement

1799
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,320
to 2025 were pulled completely by the

1800
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,280
european side because there'd been so

1801
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,960
little progress

1802
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,040
on any of the other major priorities in

1803
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:38,400
particular um on the

1804
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:40,960
on the investment talks um what wang

1805
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,400
essentially has to determine in in the

1806
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,360
next period of time

1807
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:46,239
um is whether uh china is really going

1808
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,920
to have to and

1809
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:50,480
whether it's capable of moving on a

1810
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,239
couple of these uh big issues because

1811
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,519
the german presidency is going to be

1812
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:56,000
this hinge moment

1813
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,520
for the sino-european relationship uh

1814
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
there is a real

1815
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,520
continued interest in salvaging

1816
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,400
important parts of the co-operative

1817
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,560
agenda

1818
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,638
but the political tide in germany has

1819
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,679
turned as well it stand on 5g as well as

1820
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,159
it has in most of

1821
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,760
of europe um the only reason germany is

1822
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,799
still holding out versus some of the

1823
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,639
other countries

1824
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,840
now is because the government won't put

1825
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,120
a bill in parliament because it doesn't

1826
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,400
have political support

1827
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,519
um to give huawei the role in in its 5g

1828
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,920
networks that it would

1829
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:25,760
uh like and there's been a huge

1830
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:29,280
turnaround on that which is again

1831
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:31,520
accelerated uh during the the covet 19

1832
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:32,639
crisis um the question is going to be

1833
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,760
particularly after

1834
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:37,760
angela merkel departs um this is her

1835
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,600
that this will be essentially her last

1836
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,400
year people already preparing for the

1837
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,239
aftermath

1838
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,320
um and the mood from most political

1839
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:46,239
parties even in her own party uh is for

1840
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:49,519
a very different balance of approach

1841
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:50,239
now if in this little period of a few

1842
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,960
months

1843
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:53,678
uh the chinese side is able to make

1844
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,840
movements

1845
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:56,800
on the investment agreement and on

1846
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,040
climate

1847
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,120
then it may still be possible to lock in

1848
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:04,880
certain forms of partnership with

1849
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:07,280
um europe going beyond

1850
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:09,120
the 2020 period but there's a real risk

1851
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:11,120
that if that doesn't happen

1852
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,559
and if the damage limitation exercise is

1853
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,840
unsuccessful and there's still a view on

1854
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,120
the chinese side that says that it

1855
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:17,520
doesn't have to be serious

1856
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,559
give in these areas and then we will get

1857
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:22,560
to november

1858
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:25,040
uh january uh december uh period of time

1859
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,199
um in which you are if there is a change

1860
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,560
of administration going to have this

1861
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,559
very big renewed push on the

1862
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,280
transatlantic front for closer

1863
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,960
coordination

1864
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,559
on china and there'll be a very

1865
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:37,679
different level of appetite

1866
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:40,960
uh in europe uh to be responsive to that

1867
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:42,960
um yes pompeo secretary pompeo has not

1868
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,560
necessarily been able to make as much

1869
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,679
progress in in the short term but you've

1870
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,600
even seen from

1871
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:49,600
at the eu side the willingness to launch

1872
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:52,400
this new u.s

1873
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,440
eu dialogue on on china to find closer

1874
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,120
ways to cooperate

1875
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,040
and i think that that sort of effort

1876
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:59,760
would accelerate considerably

1877
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,560
um uh by at the end of the year and and

1878
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,480
beyond so

1879
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,239
i think it's a very delicate juncture

1880
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,480
and it will be interesting to see

1881
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:07,839
whether uh wongi actually takes back

1882
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,879
some of the messages and whether we get

1883
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,199
real progress

1884
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,920
um on the sinai european front in this

1885
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:14,080
call

1886
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,360
in mid-september because otherwise um i

1887
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,199
think there's a real risk that

1888
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,719
uh the final european relationship heads

1889
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:21,360
into very very different territory by

1890
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,360
the end of this year

1891
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:26,559
right thank you so much also for

1892
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,480
outlining the time framework and the

1893
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,239
expectation that we have with uh

1894
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,000
connected to the changes of political

1895
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:34,000
leadership in so many countries in

1896
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,040
europe and also in the us

1897
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,199
uh we have time for one more question

1898
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,120
and i want to go back to the discussion

1899
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:43,120
about the chinese belt and roads

1900
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:45,280
but also the competition for influence

1901
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:47,120
not necessarily domestically within the

1902
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:49,120
european union or the us

1903
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:51,360
but also in other countries be it in the

1904
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:54,719
neighborhood of the european union

1905
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:56,960
or elsewhere and i will go first to uh

1906
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:59,120
jean li hua there is a lot of

1907
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,360
discussions in the wise that chinese

1908
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,679
belt and road initiative is questioning

1909
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,239
the

1910
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:07,679
western liberal order do you agree with

1911
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:10,959
this statement

1912
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:14,560
yes the chinese better losing meetings

1913
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,920
is purely an initiative for economic

1914
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:21,199
cooperation it aims to open up

1915
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:24,400
transportation a lot between china and

1916
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:25,839
its neighbor and as well as the country

1917
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,400
along the battle route

1918
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,440
so that china and other countries can

1919
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,120
develop together

1920
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:36,239
and get rid together very unsealed

1921
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,040
uh there is an older thing in china i'm

1922
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:40,480
good

1923
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:43,040
you are good everyone is good so that

1924
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:44,000
the world can be good chinese

1925
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:47,040
development

1926
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,239
is closely linked to the development

1927
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,960
of other countries and rising china

1928
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:55,199
can also lead can also lead other

1929
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:58,480
countries to prosperity

1930
01:23:55,199 --> 01:24:02,159
the bli is not intention to

1931
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:05,360
and will not change the

1932
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:08,799
existing liberal economic order

1933
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:12,239
now to compete for the

1934
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:15,679
dominations of the global value chains

1935
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:18,400
can adjust the one to achieved

1936
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:19,440
collectively mutual benefit win-win

1937
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,239
cooperation

1938
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:23,519
and common prosperity between china and

1939
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:27,239
other countries

1940
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:30,239
the better and raw projects are largely

1941
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:33,678
incompatible with

1942
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:34,799
liberal economic order chinese companies

1943
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:38,480
that

1944
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:42,719
that are investing in construction

1945
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:45,839
projects strictly obeyed by the rule

1946
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:49,520
of market and the law of the host

1947
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:53,760
country chinese cooperation and spending

1948
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:58,080
and undertaking projects in eu

1949
01:24:53,760 --> 01:25:02,960
country also comply with the new law

1950
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:06,880
since its economic reform in 1979

1951
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:10,639
in 1978 china has learned a lot from

1952
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:14,400
u.s and west country freedom democracy

1953
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:14,400
and the rule of law have been

1954
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,719
incorporated into china's current

1955
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:22,639
socialist surveillance

1956
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:25,920
that china wants to maintain the

1957
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:28,960
existing global economic order and

1958
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,960
liberal order

1959
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:36,000
regarding the talent due to the extreme

1960
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:39,199
high debilitation of the ui

1961
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:42,719
and the decline you correct

1962
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:46,080
decline of u.s dollar the bii

1963
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:49,280
may adopt a variety of other

1964
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:52,639
currencies such as europe

1965
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:55,759
renminbi digital currency

1966
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:58,239
or even better which

1967
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,280
could challenge maybe which could

1968
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:02,400
challenge

1969
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:05,759
the predominations of

1970
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:08,719
u.s dollars some german

1971
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,000
and french elites elite worried the

1972
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:13,639
chinese battle

1973
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,000
project were completed of their

1974
01:26:13,639 --> 01:26:19,199
infrastructure

1975
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,480
constructed market

1976
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:26,000
chinese companies have considered their

1977
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:29,678
council and have been work with those

1978
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,639
countries to develop third party

1979
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:35,199
cooperation projects in the developing

1980
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:37,040
country so that they will also benefit

1981
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:41,040
from the

1982
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:41,040
big i br i

1983
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:51,040
about the uh just now

1984
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:51,040
somebody talk about

1985
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,719
the problem of the eye

1986
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:03,759
somebody said

1987
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,960
perfect thank you so much for for your

1988
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,520
take on that and i will ask bradley and

1989
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,800
andrew

1990
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:25,280
in about uh 70 seconds each

1991
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,560
how do we respond to the chinese belt

1992
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,000
and drone initiative

1993
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,679
and also there are questions from the

1994
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,719
audience connected to that

1995
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,199
legitimately it would be expected that

1996
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:37,040
there's

1997
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:38,799
a economic support or loans offered from

1998
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,080
the european side especially to the

1999
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,679
neighborhood countries

2000
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,760
to counteract the belt and drought

2001
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,600
initiative how do you see the impacts of

2002
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,280
belt and drought initiative and

2003
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,360
what should be the european u.s

2004
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:51,280
responses to it bradley would you like

2005
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:54,320
to go first

2006
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:57,440
you have 60 seconds okay

2007
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:00,559
thank you um so first the beltway

2008
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:02,559
is not necessarily a challenge to the

2009
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,560
liberal order

2010
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,080
actually often the belton road is

2011
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,520
successful

2012
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,440
especially because of the fact that

2013
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,040
they're actually often aren't

2014
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,799
presented alternatives for a lot of

2015
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,239
countries

2016
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,800
there's a lot of room still for

2017
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:18,400
cooperation with china

2018
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,560
um especially because much of this

2019
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:23,120
infrastructure is needed worldwide

2020
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,320
it would lead to global growth the

2021
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,159
problem with it is more the

2022
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:28,960
implementation the government of it

2023
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:30,080
in the sense that it's a very state

2024
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,800
intensive

2025
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:33,840
program the deals are often uh very

2026
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,239
opaque

2027
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,960
and often we always view china as the

2028
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,480
only actor

2029
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,480
with regard to the belt and road but

2030
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,959
china um

2031
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:44,959
chinese money is often co-opted by

2032
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,600
countries themselves which are

2033
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,440
um quite savvy actors in their own right

2034
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,920
i mean we see this especially in central

2035
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,960
asia

2036
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,679
where sometimes the regimes um in the

2037
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,880
regions

2038
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:57,920
in tajikistan co-opt a project such as

2039
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,440
road construction

2040
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,760
insert road calls and the finances from

2041
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,599
them

2042
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,600
go off into offshore accounts which

2043
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,560
funnels money into the elite bank

2044
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,920
accounts

2045
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,120
so there are often these problems the

2046
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,000
belt and road that the lack of

2047
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,760
transparency

2048
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,040
actually undermines china's interest

2049
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,360
itself which is

2050
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,560
promoting its stability on its bordering

2051
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,480
regions

2052
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,239
um so that's another thing with the belt

2053
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,120
road is that there are different logics

2054
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:23,199
depending on

2055
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,159
which geographic region you're focusing

2056
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:27,519
on but

2057
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:30,400
typically with pakistan south asia and

2058
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,120
central asia you have chinese domestic

2059
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,638
interests

2060
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,800
to take into account which would be

2061
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,880
stability in its western provinces

2062
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,880
so for this sense china actually has a

2063
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,639
lot of incentive to

2064
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,239
adjust its policies because they haven't

2065
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,639
actually been serving its interests and

2066
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,320
they may

2067
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:45,760
actually be undermining stability in

2068
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:48,080
neighboring countries

2069
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:52,719
in a way that could undermine china's

2070
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:54,880
own interest in the long run

2071
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:57,040
thank you so much bradley and andrew you

2072
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,800
have the final 60 seconds for your take

2073
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:01,280
on that

2074
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,880
okay thanks um so i mean there's nothing

2075
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,159
inherently challenging to the liberal

2076
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,000
order about um

2077
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:07,199
the belton road if it's building a road

2078
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,960
or a dam or something

2079
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:10,400
there clearly are problems if china is

2080
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,080
building the uh

2081
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,679
digital and surveillance infrastructure

2082
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,960
for countries and then using it to help

2083
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,159
governments track down opposition

2084
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,880
leaders or extra

2085
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:20,080
data or facilitate great firewall type

2086
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,920
measures and things like that

2087
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,600
and as bradley suggested there are

2088
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,360
problems if china helps corrupt leaders

2089
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,800
push ahead with projects of dubious

2090
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,719
value and loads of countries down with

2091
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,639
debt so i mean there are challenges

2092
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:32,719
um there is a cooperation model that

2093
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:34,239
china itself sort of offered which was

2094
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:35,440
the aiib

2095
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:37,199
and i think we'd be in a very different

2096
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,960
place if china was channeling more of

2097
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:40,400
its resources through the aib

2098
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,560
but there's a reason that china likes to

2099
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:45,040
do these things bilaterally um

2100
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,719
and uh there are um political and

2101
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,480
security benefits that accrue to china

2102
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,000
from doing it that way and benefits that

2103
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,799
recruit chinese companies from doing it

2104
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,040
that way

2105
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,880
the problem is that and not doing it

2106
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:56,560
through the multilateral consultative

2107
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,000
structures that the aiap

2108
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,679
um put in place and the kind of high

2109
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,360
standards that were there do mean that

2110
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,400
you're getting competitive measures from

2111
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,320
from other countries

2112
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,839
japan has got its act together on this

2113
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,480
india and australia have to a certain

2114
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,000
extent

2115
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,919
as the question suggested in the first

2116
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,239
place though the us still really lags

2117
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,719
behind and the eu really lags behind

2118
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:16,159
except on a sort of intra-european basis

2119
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,800
and in parts of its very immediate

2120
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:18,638
neighborhood

2121
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,239
when it comes to really putting serious

2122
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:22,080
connectivity finance in place

2123
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:23,839
and countries are aware of that and i

2124
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,159
think it is and the very last thing i'll

2125
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,679
say

2126
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:27,519
it's going to be a real test of whether

2127
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,639
the eu is able to be a geopolitical

2128
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,480
actor

2129
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:31,760
as to whether it's able to operate in in

2130
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,280
the connectivity space

2131
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,520
now the budget is in place the budget's

2132
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,040
been agreed um if there's a dedicated

2133
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,280
stream of resources to do this

2134
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,080
the eu should be very good at doing this

2135
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,679
um

2136
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,199
if it doesn't happen it's going to be a

2137
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,639
real failure on the

2138
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:46,080
eu's part because there's still a real

2139
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,639
need for for this on the part of the

2140
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,840
countries

2141
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:50,400
and there's still a real need to be able

2142
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,639
to compete with with china in this area

2143
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,638
as well

2144
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,080
thank you so much andrew i'm glad that

2145
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:59,280
uh

2146
01:31:56,080 --> 01:32:01,440
despite the um a rather heated

2147
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,320
discussion in the international scene we

2148
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:05,199
found

2149
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:06,719
we actually learned through the debate

2150
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:08,960
today that the

2151
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:11,120
uh european union united states and

2152
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,560
china are not inherently incompatible

2153
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,639
and there is a plenty area

2154
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:16,639
of cooperation where this cooperation is

2155
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,920
possible so thank you very much to all

2156
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,080
the panelists for the

2157
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,679
very rich discussion today thank you

2158
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,559
very much for all the participants of

2159
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,400
this session

2160
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,000
we're going to have a short break and

2161
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:28,960
resume the programming at

2162
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,120
3 00 pm central european time and i have

2163
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,880
a small announcement concerning our

2164
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:36,000
scheduling on friday

2165
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,960
we have another speaker confirmed for

2166
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
the session

2167
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:42,239
that will start at 6 40 p.m central

2168
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,400
european time and we're very delighted

2169
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:46,000
to welcome svetlana tikanovska

2170
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:47,759
who is the opposition leader in the

2171
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,080
former presidential candidate and the

2172
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:52,800
belarusian elections 2020

2173
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:54,400
who will be having a conversation under

2174
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,000
the guidance of terry martin the

2175
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,519
moderator from deutsche welle

2176
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:09,199
we're looking forward to seeing you soon

2177
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:11,440
with us again thank you very much

2178
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:13,360
globesec bratislava forum is the

2179
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:17,440
platform to tackle disruption and

2180
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:19,199
discuss solutions for better tomorrows

2181
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,559
basic theme of disruption is crucial

2182
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:22,159
because to me

2183
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,840
the issue is not whether it's climate

2184
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:25,199
change or whether it's the chinese or

2185
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,679
the russians or whatever

2186
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,559
it's actually the concatenation the mix

2187
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:29,840
of them all

2188
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,440
and that's what i think is so valuable

2189
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,400
about this because it is a generalized

2190
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:35,839
conference

2191
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,839
it allows us to see how
