a very exciting time and difficult time

15
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,760
for the european economy

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,320
um just last month there was a very big

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,799
negotiation here in brussels

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,600
all 27 heads of state and government

19
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,640
were here

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,119
and they decided on a big budget and

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,159
recovery package

22
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:26,560
1.82 trillion euros

23
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,320
and that is said to have a big impact on

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,479
the economy also in central

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,439
europe today's subject is the disruption

26
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,799
as central europe's accelerator for deep

27
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,600
economic overhaul

28
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,799
and of course the disruption meaning uh

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,360
primarily i think

30
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
the coronavirus crisis how it has

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
impacted

32
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,920
economies in the region and um how

33
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,398
perhaps the fight against the crisis

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,360
and and the recovery process could help

35
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,880
transform

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,000

questions as

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,000
possible so to start off i think it

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,480
would be very good for us to

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,599
keep in mind the extent of the

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,159
disruption

70
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,238
uh to central europe's economies so

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,560
sonia would you mind perhaps giving us

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,640
an

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,599
overview of the current economic

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,159
situation

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:33,839
what has been the impact of covid over

76
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:33,840
the past few months

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,760
um

78
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:47,839

80
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,080
okay

81
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,080

82
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,000
okay um i'm sorry everyone we seem to

83
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
have a bit of a technical problem uh

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,960
hearing sonia

85
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,240
so um in the meantime if we could

86
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,680
perhaps go to

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,800
um diragosh before the session was just

88
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
telling us

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,479
that he has been working on the

90
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,800
parliament's position

91
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,800
on the um recovery and resilience

92
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,280
facility which is this big

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,120
part of money that will be going um two

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,000
member states to help with the economic

95
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,479
recovery

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
uh following the coveted crisis did i go

97
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,280
um what do you think

98
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,680
are the lessons learned from the crisis

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,919
and how can central europe

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,919
effectively use this new eu money

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
um first of all thank you very much for

102
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,120
the invitation and it's a delight

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,919
to be uh alongside such fellow panelists

104
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
and uh

105
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,400
to talk here this event um indeed

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,880
um i mean the title of the debate

107
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,039
was actually um quite in line with with

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,039
my feeling and

109
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,719
the lives the changes that we are

110
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,759
currently living um

111
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,160
it's it's you know been told

112
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,319
by everyone these months that in every

113
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
christ lies an opportunity and i do

114
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
believe

115
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,880
indeed that we have an opportunity both

116
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,680
to raise the ambition at the european

117
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,440
level

118
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,160
and also to see better the challenges at

119
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,000
the central eastern european level for

120
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,240
the central eastern european countries

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
and to see the in comparison with the

122
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,319
western europe

123
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,280
how we are actually faring now um we

124
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,080
all knew the structural problems that we

125
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,960
are facing in this part of europe in

126
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,440
in the central eastern uh part of europe

127
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,239
um

128
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,280
the crisis has actually uh revealed

129
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
those structural

130
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,039
problems uh even further and i would

131
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,319
actually say

132
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,800
that we see right now why we need

133
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,680
to increase basically the resilience of

134
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,560
the entire

135
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,080
uh european union and to act together in

136
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
this particular process

137
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,039
and there are three main dilemmas and

138
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,960
then i will go a little bit on the rrf

139
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,800
the recovery and resilience program and

140
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,799
you know the next generation

141
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,080
uh the solution that european union is

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,919
actually putting forward

143
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,520
the three challenges that we're actually

144
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,520
facing is that

145
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,599
um and and i'm talking here i'm putting

146
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,719
myself in the shoes of you know

147
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,919
any government in in the area so first

148
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,680
of all you need to fix

149
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,960
things that have been you know affected

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
by the crisis and

151
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,280
you know uh you know fixing things

152
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,919
referred to things that um

153
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,440
are right now obviously um you know

154
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,080
lagged in terms of the

155
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,280
investment projects that have been a

156
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,198
couple of uh

157
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,440
some some time ago planned also we

158
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,199
are also fixing things that are the

159
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,000
direct effect of the crisis that

160
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,280
is more or less creating new jobs or

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,919
creating

162
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,960
ways for the companies to come back to

163
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,520
their activity

164
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
insolvency programs furlough schemes and

165
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,758
so on and so forth

166
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,840
but that's one thing the other thing

167
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,240
that we have right now as an opportunity

168
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
and

169
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,080
especially for central eastern europe i

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,800
would say is to

171
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,919
basically leapfrog to use this

172
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,280
opportunity

173
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,000
to actually make that bold step forward

174
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,599
to increase the potential gdp to to go

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
on for innovation to go on for

176
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,319
technologies be that in the green

177
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,039
digital

178
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,720
or other economic ecosystems as they are

179
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,199
actually called right now in the draft

180
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
of the

181
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,440
uh new european industrial policy so the

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,919
first big challenge

183
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,960
is what would be the mix in between

184
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,758
fixing things

185
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,598
and looking for leapfrogging going you

186
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,080
know

187
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,399
raising the bar for for the european

188
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,159
project so and and this is actually

189
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,919
very very important and i would say that

190
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,559
the member states that the countries

191
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,880
that will

192
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,399
choose to do the leapfrogging would be

193
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,320
would be actually better

194
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,760
off i would the second challenge very

195
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,880
quickly would be

196
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,519
referring to an integrated approach

197
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,000
a silo policy right now there is a

198
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,240
tendency even in brussels to talk about

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,480
green and go very deep on green to talk

200
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,760
about digital version

201
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,839
of that talk about the

202
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
economic and then and the companies and

203
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,360
so on um

204
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,800
but at the same time there there is

205
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
evidence that we need

206
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,640
social resilience we need institutional

207
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,920
resilience and we need to talk about

208
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,680
our youth obviously and if we don't have

209
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,399
an integrated approach

210
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,760
if we are not working together then we

211
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,480
are going to have a problem so i would

212
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
say

213
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,320
the big challenge would be indeed how to

214
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,719
actually work out

215
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,680
solutions that will be integrated and

216
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
not um

217
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,880
you know sector and the last challenge

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,240
that i would say

219
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,040
is directly linked to the young

220
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,959
generation and i'm saying that by

221
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,959
looking at opinion polls

222
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,119
and looking at the fact that the the

223
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,160
young people are not necessarily

224
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,160
um let's say ecstatic about the eu there

225
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,079
are some worrying trends going on

226
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,600
and if you call the package the next

227
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,160
generation eu

228
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,760
and you are not going to tackle directly

229
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,560
the opportunities and access

230
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
of you know young people and talking

231
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,839
about the

232
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,120
the children guarantee perhaps and then

233
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,640
it's going to be a problem and i would

234
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,480
say that there is a

235
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,240
there is a big challenge that includes

236
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,839
the demographic challenge and the fact

237
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,920
that the elderly have been much more

238
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,240
exposed to the crisis than

239
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,279
um than other parts of the population

240
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
and the fact that

241
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,800
everything is changing and there will be

242
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,680
a polarization of generations

243
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,279
um threatening to to tear apart the

244
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,000
social strata in europe

245
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,480
so three challenges what we need and

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,760
what we hope to deliver to the rrf

247
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,240
is to to be able to do both the fixing

248
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,319
and raising the ambition to have an

249
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,399
integrated view and then in the design

250
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,279
of the rrf i'm actually very pleased to

251
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,760
tell you

252
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,600
you know right now in you know before

253
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,360
everything as goes public that we're

254
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,399
going to have six pillars so

255
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,279
green digital competitiveness social

256
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,320
institutional

257
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,680
and next generation and by saying that

258
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,519
obviously addressing the third challenge

259
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,560
that is the demographic challenge

260
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,480
and this is actually the package that

261
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,399
obviously would be adapted by

262
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,920
needs to be adapted by each of the

263
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,600
member states of the countries in the

264
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,439
centers to europe

265
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
but but it will actually create a

266
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
leverage at the year level it will have

267
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,760
an

268
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,079
impact at your level if we are actually

269
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
going to to follow that as a particular

270
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,359
strategic

271
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,439
view on how to move further so i'm very

272
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
optimistic about it i i don't think that

273
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,959
we are just having a

274
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,160
helicopter money um you know that will

275
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,560
actually spread spread

276
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,680
money around i think that uh there will

277
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,920
be um

278
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,599
a clear link with european semester and

279
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,439
we have the chance to be stronger

280
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,399
together uh in this particular process

281
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
so i have a

282
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
i have the news that i can bring you

283
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,040
that there are good prospects for ce

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,399
countries too not only to recover but to

285
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,959
become much more resilient for the

286
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,959
future shocks

287
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,200
thank you so much dragosh i was

288
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,240
wondering if we could next go to

289
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,639
laszlo who perhaps could give us uh

290
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,680
his views specifically on the situation

291
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,079
in hungary

292
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
um how has covert impacted hungary's

293
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,560
economy

294
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:10,480
and what do you think are the lessons

295
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,560
that should be learned there

296
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,600
uh let me thank you for the invitation

297
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,279
and it's um

298
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,399
really an honor to be able to join there

299
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,399
um indeed um the picture of central and

300
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,200
eastern europe is fascinating

301
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,200
uh because in the past decade or we can

302
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,639
even speak about 15 years

303
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,760
there has been a strong convergence

304
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,120
process and the growth rates of

305
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,240
this region although unevenly

306
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,000
and have been much higher

307
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,279
including in hungary including in other

308
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,399
countries

309
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,600
than the euro area

310
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,760
and um i agree with the previous speaker

311
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,560
mr pistaro that it's a it's a major

312
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,439
question

313
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,000
how to ensure that after this deception

314
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,399
uh

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,680
we are not losing momentum uh quite a

316
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,959
contrary how to gain

317
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,920
some kind of new momentum and i think we

318
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,800
would probably

319
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,719
agree that this region would need to

320
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,000
somehow reconsider

321
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,200
the growth model and why

322
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,519
would it need to happen

323
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,120
first of all because this is not the

324
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,240
first disruption

325
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,360
and already 10 years ago in 2009 the

326
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,800
great recession

327
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,000
also affected this region

328
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,920
and while before the great recession

329
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,480
the growth rates in the visagrad

330
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,479
countries

331
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,120
dynamic uh convergence

332
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,760
process that was not reproducible

333
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,519
after the great great recession so the

334
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,959
growth rates only became

335
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,519
about two twice as high as in western

336
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,439
europe

337
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,519
and i think it would already be a great

338
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,320
achievement if this could be

339
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,399
restored however what happened in the

340
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,120
meantime especially in the last five six

341
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,279
years

342
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,399
a major outflow of human capital

343
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:15,519
i think the importance of the outflow

344
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,440
of labor should not be underestimated

345
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,519
because already in the last five six

346
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,399
years we have seen

347
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,399
that um

348
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,360
this became a bottleneck on industrial

349
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,880
growth and other types of

350
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,600
economic and you were asking me

351
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,120
really about hungary specifically i

352
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,639
think hungary is also

353
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,000
a remarkable example of this bottom

354
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:45,519
lane because originally the

355
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,839
force was not as mobile as the polish or

356
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,120
as the baltic or as the romanian

357
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,000
but increasingly it became very very

358
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,360
mobile

359
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
as the austerity

360
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,360
actually the transitional uh

361
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,360
restrictions expired in 2011 the

362
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,959
so-called seven-year transitional

363
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,240
period and the industrial relations got

364
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,800
much worse and social rights and labor

365
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,640
rights

366
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,560
uh and and wages were undermined um

367
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,439
[Music]

368
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,839
following 2011 and 12 with the new labor

369
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
code

370
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:29,120
so there were many many push factors

371
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,480
which send hundreds of thousands of

372
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,120
people to other countries

373
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,320
and obviously when a new multinational

374
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,560
comes today

375
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,839
it's uh it's more difficult to find the

376
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,959
right workforce

377
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,160
and the drivers of foreign investment

378
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,279
which were very effective before low

379
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,439
taxation

380
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,040
cost competitiveness from the wage side

381
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
in other aspects

382
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,920
and not going

383
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,519
strong to deliver

384
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,880
investment and growth and job creation

385
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
as uh before

386
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,920
so in any case in hungary as well as

387
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,599
other countries

388
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,920
there will be an opportunity

389
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,600
to to reconsider the model of growth how

390
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,160
to escape

391
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:19,600
from the the of course competitiveness

392
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,399
and move towards higher value-added

393
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,959
which also requires more investment more

394
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,600
systematic investment

395
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,959
in human capital on this point i would

396
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,360
reconnect

397
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,800
with the question of the european union

398
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,240
budget

399
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,319
because from our region from my country

400
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,639
also

401
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
there is very often a kind of shortcut

402
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,199
when we speak about

403
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:51,839
eu transverse eu money we think

404
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,839
about infrastructure

405
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:02,079
innovation of the main square

406
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,119
and the costly especially if you want to

407
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,678
the population by this type of

408
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,359
activities but the point is to shift

409
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,240
towards more human capital

410
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:18,799
and in a way the member states including

411
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:20,559
in east central europe

412
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,240
and i think this could be a general

413
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,240
encouragement um

414
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
particularly for countries which

415
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,480
experience the labor

416
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,960
outflow like hungary for example uh to

417
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,880
invest

418
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,520
more in human capital and reinforce

419
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,000
the resilience of the school system the

420
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,360
labor

421
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,120
market institutions the training systems

422
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,000
um in order to provide better conditions

423
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,879
for the workforce itself but also for

424
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,640
the

425
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,240
mystery would come and of course

426
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,240
will compare the

427
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,280
member states not only from the point of

428
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,360
view of taxation

429
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,879
but also from the point of view of

430
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,879
available human resources

431
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,559
thank you so much i'm told that sonia's

432
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,799
technical problem has been resolved so

433
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,000
i'll ask you again sonia perhaps to give

434
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,760
us an overview

435
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,280
of the impact of the crisis on the

436
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,440
region's economies right now

437
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,399
yes thank you very much and i i hope you

438
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,520
can now hear me

439
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,440
um so overall the central european

440
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,480
economies manage the pandemic

441
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,480
uh quite well in the initial wave uh

442
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,039
with relatively contained infection

443
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,559
rates and some of the lowest per capita

444
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,480
uh death rates within europe um this

445
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,160
good management of the crisis surprised

446
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,080
to the upside as the government

447
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,480
efficiency is not exactly

448
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,918
um top rated and neither are the health

449
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,240
care systems

450
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,600
and also these countries are not exactly

451
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,400
technological leaders

452
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,719
so their response couldn't really rely

453
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,520
on

454
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,320
intelligent solutions and and tracking

455
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,480
apps

456
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,399
and even there was a leadership switch

457
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,919
in slovakia at the beginning of march

458
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,720
so it was a very good um management of

459
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,640
the crisis

460
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,240
uh given all of these features and

461
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,000
circumstances

462
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,600
there is a shared consensus that the

463
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,400
management was successful

464
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,120
mainly due to those due to the speed of

465
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,280
the measured

466
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,959
measures institutionalized mostly um

467
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,879
these measures were basically put in

468
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,160
place before these countries

469
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,280
hit the 100 case benchmark or even

470
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,799
before the first

471
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,399
death um so the infection curve did not

472
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,960
hit exponential growth so

473
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
this was very important and in terms of

474
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,080
the health and containment measures i

475
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,399
mean they were the usual uh

476
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,439
travel restrictions quarantines closures

477
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,400
are of

478
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,720
non-essential business and also limiting

479
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,200
production and industrial sites which of

480
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,520
course

481
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
uh took a toll on the economy of central

482
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,960
and eastern europe um

483
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,799
but before we get to that i wanted to

484
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,440
talk about briefly

485
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,240
about the main pillars of the policy

486
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,520
response

487
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:05,440
um in these countries and beyond

488
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,918
um basically on the so on a global scale

489
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,480
uh

490
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,240
the the response is unprecedented with

491
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,120
the direct fiscal

492
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
um stimulus reaching seven seven percent

493
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,799
of

494
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,879
2019 gdp and the scale of fiscal

495
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,679
response significantly exceeded

496
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,280
that after great financial crisis that's

497
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,760
also important to note

498
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,799
on the monetary policy front uh central

499
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,600
banks stepped up

500
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,520
their already very accommodative stance

501
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,320
we've seen rate cuts where possible in

502
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,639
czechia

503
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,678
in poland we've seen various

504
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,919
calibrations on bond buying programs

505
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,440
launching of new liquidity lines to

506
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,720
support the real economy through the

507
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,600
banking sector

508
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,600
and also micro prudential policies

509
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,320
relaxation of credit provision

510
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,360
requirements and elevation of capital

511
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,280
buffers

512
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,879
overall we can say that the central bank

513
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,918
response was timely

514
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,919
it was coordinated cohesive

515
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,120
and heavily also drawing on the great

516
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,720
financial crisis

517
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,280
uh playbook and even going beyond it

518
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,280
um on the fiscal front and i'm not now

519
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,399
talking about discretionary physical

520
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,120
measures

521
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
uh the response was more fragmented a

522
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,879
little less

523
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,600
coordinated and also um is different in

524
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,880
terms of

525
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,760
size of the fiscal impulse in europe um

526
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,120
so to give you a flavor the direct

527
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,840
fiscal measure is very

528
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,158
varied from around three percent in for

529
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,439
example poland or spain

530
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,559
to about 4.5 in france and italy to

531
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,159
about eight percent

532
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,840
in germany um and in smaller central

533
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,760
european countries they were

534
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,918
modest between one to three percent um

535
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,000
in terms of substance these policies

536
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,120
targeted mostly

537
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,480
stating firms and workers um it was a

538
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,479
policy mix

539
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,480
consisting of financial provisions

540
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,360
liquidity provisions and also

541
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,000
tax and social provisions of course the

542
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,639
health care

543
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,440
funding was expanded and government

544
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,559
guarantees

545
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,960
also played a very large role

546
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,720
um in addition there was the european

547
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,720
response and i think that deserves a

548
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,840
separate space and a separate discussion

549
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,200
so i will

550
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,520
leave that aside for later um in terms

551
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,799
of

552
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,440
impacts on the real economy so basically

553
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,960
there was the direct hit on both the

554
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,760
demand and supply side

555
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,799
for the central european economies but

556
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,520
there was also

557
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,080
the hit going through the external

558
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,320
channel

559
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,280
as we know that these economies are

560
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,520
opened and

561
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,840
they are very closely meeting global

562
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,840
value chains

563
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
so

564
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,158
um the the overall impact on these on

565
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,559
these economies

566
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,679
so just to give you an idea in the first

567
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,559
quarter actually

568
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,120
slovakia contracted the most uh in the

569
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,559
region

570
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,799
at minus 3.8 on an annual basis

571
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,559
um this was worse for example than in

572
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,200
germany and worse than the

573
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,280
than the european averages uh more

574
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,880
closer actually to the southern european

575
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,000
fears that were

576
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,679
harder hits by the pandemic but

577
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,760
in the second quarter actually the

578
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,080
number surprised to the upside so

579
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,559
i think the the bottom line and what we

580
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,120
can conclude based on this is that

581
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,039
um there will be surprises there will be

582
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,840
revisions because we know that the

583
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,000
quality of

584
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,918
macroeconomic data and national accounts

585
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,799
are not exactly the best especially

586
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:34,400
during the time of crisis and turbulence

587
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:37,760
um and uh just i mean in terms of

588
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,679
outlook also um the oecd the european

589
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,240
commission and the imf

590
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,279
um forecasts very greatly for these

591
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,320
countries

592
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:50,880
for slovakia um

593
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,480
ranging from -6 to -11 for 2020

594
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,000
for the czech republic minus six to

595
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,960
minus 13

596
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,919
uh with about four to five percent uh

597
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,919
bounce back in 2021 projected but

598
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,960
you know uh it's a wide range of

599
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,240
outcomes and

600
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,400
we'll see um so this is where we are at

601
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,080
and in slovakia the second wave has

602
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,919
already been confirmed by the

603
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,600
authorities just like in many other

604
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,880
countries in europe

605
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,080
so a lot is to be seen and over back to

606
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,000
lilly so we can

607
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,480
move to more interesting parts of this

608
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,480
discussion

609
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,600
thank you so much for that sonia really

610
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,279
fascinating and i'm very curious how the

611
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,439
numbers are going to evolve

612
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,039
uh in terms of the economic data over

613
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,039
the coming months

614
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,840
alexander you have a very unique

615
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,400
perspective on this panel because

616
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,720
you are coming from the private sector

617
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,360
so i was wondering from your perspective

618
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,039
as a head of a bank in slovakia what are

619
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,039
their lessons from this crisis

620
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,039
well first of all thank you very much

621
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,960
also for this invitation and the

622
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,879
opportunity to participate

623
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,400
and as you correctly said i'm coming

624
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,760
from the private sector so i have a

625
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,440
little bit a different

626
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,440
view or input or perspective from this

627
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,880
from this uh from this point of view

628
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,720
sonia already mentioned

629
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,760
a lot of things related to slovakia

630
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,440
so for me based on

631
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,520
my 30 years experience in in in banking

632
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,320
what we have gone through since the

633
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,639
beginning of the year was really

634
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:28,080
extraordinary because never ever we have

635
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,880
seen such uh a crisis especially

636
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,559
coming from a health perspective point

637
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,640
of view from the abandonment which

638
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,080
basically gave just one measure a

639
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
counter measure and the countermeasure

640
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,559
was

641
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,919
social distancing which means an

642
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,520
economic lockdown

643
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,919
and as sonia was saying the new

644
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,000
administration the outgoing and the new

645
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,600
administration in slovakia reacted very

646
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,720
quickly very promptly

647
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,120
in in a very um severe way

648
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,679
uh which saved a lot of lives i believe

649
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,479
uh they did a very good job here

650
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,760
but it had an impact and the impact was

651
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,679
that overnight

652
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,360
uh basically the whole ecosystem

653
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,000
economic system

654
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,360
came to a standstill families were

655
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,720
losing their regular

656
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,840
income for instance um companies

657
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,840
overnight lost their sales

658
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,240
opportunities were sitting on their

659
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,399
stocks and not coming in cash flows

660
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,919
even the public administration had

661
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,159
problems uh to

662
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,000
to sustain this financing because there

663
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,200
were some bonds to be issued

664
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,080
and there were some liquidity

665
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,720
constraints so uh what proved in this

666
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,480
moment

667
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:38,000
very crucial was the close cooperation

668
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,880
between various actors and i must say

669
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,080
what i have what i have experienced in

670
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
this period

671
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,240
the cooperation with the public

672
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,480
administration with the national banking

673
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,159
in particular as well was really

674
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,799
extraordinary good

675
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,200
and what proved crucial in this moment

676
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,360
was

677
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,480
um to have um a very well set up

678
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,399
business continuity management uh

679
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,159
in the past we were always a little bit

680
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,400
uh thinking as a

681
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,200
theoretical exercise business continuity

682
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,240
management

683
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,320
but in this moment it proved uh crucial

684
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,000
to be able to switch from one day to

685
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,439
another to a complete

686
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,240
different uh setup of your daily life of

687
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,720
your

688
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,720
daily operations and so on and that

689
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,799
happened extremely quickly

690
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,320
and that helped us for instance if we

691
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,918
talk about the banking sector

692
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,678
help uh quickly to discuss with the

693
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,600
public administration and to discuss

694
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,159
with the central bank to come up with a

695
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,959
very good moratorium which was very much

696
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,880
flexible

697
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,120
it's one of the most flexible in the

698
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,799
region which helped a lot

699
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,600
of families to overcome this

700
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,080
let's say missing income regular income

701
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,639
the other

702
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,760
side was immediately safeguarding

703
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,240
liquidity

704
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,520
uh to the companies as such so we were

705
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,679
preparing several

706
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,799
uh backup facilities also together with

707
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,200
the national bank

708
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,480
and that and obviously also for the

709
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,399
public administration

710
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,200
where we were able to um to commit bond

711
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,320
issuance

712
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,200
uh in such amount that uh it was easily

713
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,080
to be covered

714
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,440
all the needs uh for for all the aids

715
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,600
which needed to be set up

716
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,360
so from this perspective for me it was

717
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,080
very crucial to have this

718
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,559
uh business continuity management set up

719
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,720
in

720
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,559
in such an open way and not only as a

721
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,840
single operator but as a sector

722
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,639
and as a system then after once we have

723
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,678
settled this

724
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,000
obviously immediately uh

725
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,600
new business uh we lost a lot of new

726
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,559
business in certain

727
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,760
product areas we lost up to 90 so you

728
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,480
needed to quickly

729
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,480
rethink how to do your daily operations

730
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,880
and not only banking all the sectors

731
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,640
and i must say people have been very

732
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,919
creative have been very

733
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,600
responsive um in coming up with new

734
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,399
ideas how do we think

735
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,000
from physical presence to let's say

736
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,080
digital presence yeah

737
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,720
and this means how you identify the

738
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,559
counterpart how do you authorize a

739
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,559
certain transaction and all this type of

740
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,240
stuff you needed to cope

741
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,399
you found out you had a lot of

742
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,120
capacities which

743
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,719
were idle were not used what do you do

744
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,120
with this over capacity

745
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,279
and what will you do in the future

746
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,360
because you could already foreseen that

747
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,880
there will be a lot of over capacities

748
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,320
and talking about for instance

749
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,919
offices space

750
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,000
there will be a lot of things which will

751
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,960
change with the smart working concept

752
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,120
which will

753
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,440
will for sure come and last but not

754
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,678
least also the whole supply

755
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,279
supply management operational risk

756
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,520
overnight you lost

757
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,720
your regular supply how you deal with it

758
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,799
what is the backup

759
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,480
so there were a lot of learnings and i

760
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,600
think um

761
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,399
slovakia as such responded very well and

762
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,279
also

763
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,080
the hit was hardest uh as sonia was

764
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,880
saying

765
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,000
but also the recovery right now in the

766
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,000
second quarter

767
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,679
and also what we can see in the last

768
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,159
months the feedback i get

769
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,000
from the economic players the recovery

770
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,480
is faster than than

771
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,320
expected which is very very good uh we

772
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,520
will need to see how this is gonna

773
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,320
change in the

774
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,240
uh the upcoming weeks and months uh so

775
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,039
we are in the middle of a second wave

776
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,399
so how we will deal with that so but i

777
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,760
i'm very much positive

778
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,600
also because i have seen a change in the

779
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,840
attitude of the people

780
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,120
in the moment we we were suffering the

781
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,240
biggest crisis

782
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,039
i have seen so many people standing to

783
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,200
each other

784
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,279
helping each other supporting each other

785
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,480
mobilizing the community

786
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,640
to to to to face these uh these health

787
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,120
crisis these human crisis it was much

788
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,120
more

789
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,039
important to help each other than than

790
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,879
all the others so i'm very positive

791
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,679
about that we will manage that

792
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,120
and this according to me represents a

793
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,840
unique opportunity

794
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,959
to rethink our economical setup and this

795
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,360
is very much true

796
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,840
for slovakia thank you so much alexander

797
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,120
really fascinating uh how the banking

798
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,760
sector has been doing

799
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,678
um uh we talked a bit about hungary we

800
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,120
talked about slovakia so i was wondering

801
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,240
if maybe you could put on your

802
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,239
romanian politician hat um and

803
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,760
tell us a little bit about how romania

804
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,880
has been coping with this crisis

805
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,200
economically

806
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,039
um i was reading a few weeks ago that

807
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,159
the coveted numbers were relatively high

808
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,399
in romania

809
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,399
um what do you think the lessons are for

810
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:35,518
the romanian economy uh

811
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,918
first of all uh i am so um

812
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,559
amazed of the commonalities that we've

813
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,559
been uh

814
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,399
talking about in this panel hungary

815
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,879
slovakia and i mean a lot of

816
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,239
things are actually uh very valid for

817
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,120
romania as such

818
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,480
um romania i mean obviously we we've

819
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,039
been witnessing uh

820
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,519
in all these countries and across europe

821
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,679
uh

822
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,679
what can be called a dual shock both on

823
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,880
the demand and the supply

824
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,880
um and uh i mean uh the

825
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,559
the shock has been symmetrical uh

826
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,880
throughout europe basically so i will

827
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,480
not

828
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,640
go again in what happened as a

829
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,320
consequence i will talk a little bit

830
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,159
about the reaction of the romanian

831
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,799
government and what's actually happening

832
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,240
right now

833
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,120
um so the reaction was quite swift

834
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,720
i would say um so uh the authorities

835
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,918
have actually launched immediately

836
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,399
uh furlough scheme um and then

837
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,000
uh later on they even introduced

838
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,360
kurzarbite type scheme in

839
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,360
uh related to you know more or less

840
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,719
the flexible labor arrangements and

841
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,479
somehow to take

842
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,760
some of the burden of the companies that

843
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,039
have been uh shut down

844
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,600
in the lockdown or even afterwards um

845
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,559
especially the uh the hereka industry

846
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,600
and so on

847
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,879
um and um at the same time

848
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,158
obviously uh as was described by

849
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,440
alexander there were a lot of

850
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,640
investments that have been actually

851
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,840
postponed

852
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,840
um so basically what we are have been

853
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,678
witness is um

854
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,678
a try from the government to more or

855
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,519
less substitute the private investment

856
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,399
with uh some sort of a stimulus for

857
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,399
for public investment so right now a lot

858
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,279
of the projects that have been postponed

859
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,120
over the years

860
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,799
have actually been brought in this

861
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,080
investment plan that the government is

862
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,279
putting forward

863
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,760
um to actually push things uh uh from

864
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,480
from this particular perspective so um a

865
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,919
public

866
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,120
investment stimulus was there

867
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,159
unfortunately after a very successful

868
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,279
effort of the government to contain

869
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,159
the effect of the crisis people have

870
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,360
relaxed and

871
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,480
when we are calling about you know we we

872
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,199
are actually using the

873
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,080
the way the word relaxation so actually

874
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,880
everyone got

875
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,080
that relaxed over the summer that um

876
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,559
unfortunately uh

877
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,158
no one respected the basic rules uh we

878
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,039
you know simple things like wearing the

879
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,720
mask and

880
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,039
you know keeping the physical distance

881
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,679
and so on which led actually to

882
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,640
some sort of a second wave um and the

883
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,519
romania

884
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,159
um it's still there uh trying to

885
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,760
struggle

886
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,240
with this um you know

887
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,879
you know trend that was quite visible

888
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,399
actually

889
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,359
um in terms of new cases and deceased uh

890
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,598
cases

891
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,440
uh per thousand inhabitants and so on

892
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,159
right now i would say that the situation

893
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,359
is more

894
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,280
stabilized and we will probably see

895
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,799
some improvement in in the period that

896
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,119
that comes um

897
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,359
what is one lesson learned that i think

898
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,800
it's actually crucial for

899
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,639
um the the future as well is how do you

900
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,079
communicate with the population and with

901
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,159
the economic sector

902
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,560
so the lack of predictability is

903
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,839
actually sometimes worse the particular

904
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,639
shock that you have

905
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,359
and i mean there are a lot of questions

906
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
in the air

907
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,799
how when we are reopening the activities

908
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,359
what are the rules that

909
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,200
we need to respect how what are we going

910
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,639
to do what's the regulation that we are

911
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,118
looking at and so on so

912
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,920
so one of the of the commonalities um

913
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,640
that i've seen in other countries is

914
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,680
where you had more empathic

915
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,440
communication

916
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,799
a more uh you know clear um

917
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,400
discussion and and transparency towards

918
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,000
the population and the business sector

919
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,160
the results were better

920
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,920
when you adopted the more like military

921
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,000
style thing saying you know

922
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,599
we are closing here and closing there

923
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,480
and opening there and only in some

924
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,720
conditions

925
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,760
and not you know without having the

926
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,000
clarity

927
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,880
then what what actually was the result

928
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,359
is that people

929
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,160
either didn't respect the rules or uh

930
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,920
businesses

931
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,279
um because we are talking about the

932
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,680
economy uh

933
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,599
were actually diffident in in going

934
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,078
further with investments and so on

935
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,800
i would like to end this intervention by

936
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,400
saying that

937
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,839
um in terms of the perspectives

938
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,160
indeed as as was mentioned here by by

939
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,839
by fellow panelists we are looking at

940
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,720
the reset we are looking

941
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,279
at a model that we can develop uh you

942
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,919
know in in unprecedented ways because we

943
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,480
have the funding available from the eu

944
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,320
and we have the the right momentum to do

945
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,160
so and i will just you know

946
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,400
talk about three things very very

947
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,040
briefly first you have the technology

948
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,839
aspect

949
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,839
right now europe wants to gain back the

950
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,920
leadership in technology

951
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,599
you know at worldwide level and the

952
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,760
green deal is part of that

953
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,200
digital is part of that the ecosystems

954
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,680
and the industrial policy are part of

955
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,839
that

956
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,040
so central eastern europe can actually

957
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,720
you know play

958
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,119
play there with the with with the big

959
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,240
guys i mean we can actually be there and

960
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,800
create hubs

961
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,560
and ecosystems and and value chains that

962
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,800
that can actually be there for the green

963
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,640
technology the digital technology

964
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,320
and other ecosystem the second thing is

965
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,759
about solidarity and alexander has

966
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,160
described very well

967
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,280
this feeling of solidarity that we felt

968
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,040
it's actually

969
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,800
a very very good opportunity to

970
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,440
translate into reforms

971
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,640
you know reforms real reforms of our

972
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,320
social assistance

973
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,920
um let's say systems that we have in

974
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,599
central eastern europe and some of the

975
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,079
social assistance systems that are not

976
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,240
going

977
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,200
uh so well are not that efficient are

978
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,279
not covering

979
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,319
the ones that are left behind and

980
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,000
thirdly and

981
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,520
and this is actually very very important

982
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,920
as well um it's

983
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,920
it's a period in which we need to look

984
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,160
at the next generation and to

985
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,000
look about access to education and

986
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,720
health and for that obviously

987
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,160
you need reforms as well so you know you

988
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,399
know economy

989
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,319
you know it's it's one thing the other

990
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,280
thing is the social part and then

991
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,560
education and health are also two major

992
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,440
opportunities that we have

993
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,320
uh to to to to go on and activate for

994
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,320
for the near future

995
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,000
thank you so much i'm not sure if we've

996
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,400
reconnected to

997
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,760
to laszlo but in in case we have um

998
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,800
laszlo

999
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,720
my question to you is um we we've heard

1000
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,280
a lot of ideas and one thing that

1001
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,839
everyone

1002
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,599
seems to be touching upon a bit is this

1003
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,920
idea that perhaps

1004
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,200
um the crisis could help the region

1005
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,680
transition a bit

1006
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,560
so what do you think could be done to

1007
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,160
help the region

1008
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,160
move up to higher value-added functions

1009
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,480
can you hear me i think that's an

1010
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,920
important question

1011
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,400
yes we can hear you well okay fantastic

1012
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,000
great

1013
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,240
uh look um i think uh several speakers

1014
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,720
mentioned the importance of education

1015
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
and um i think this needs to be

1016
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,720
highlight highlighted

1017
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,520
also because there is an alarming

1018
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,598
element

1019
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,800
in the kovid crisis situation

1020
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,480
i think we all welcome the possibilities

1021
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,599
to

1022
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,320
implement new models of online

1023
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,240
learning however i think we also learned

1024
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,560
in the spring and summer period

1025
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,118
that the online education is not a

1026
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,359
perfect replacement of the real

1027
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,400
schooling especially when when it comes

1028
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,160
to

1029
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,560
primary and secondary education

1030
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,399
so one way or another i think societies

1031
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,440
would need to make some kind of

1032
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,240
sacrifice

1033
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,720
in order to ensure that kids can return

1034
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,000
to schools maybe not full-time but at

1035
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,879
least part-time

1036
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,640
and then you know re-socialize and

1037
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,440
return to the routine

1038
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,078
of systematic uh learning because

1039
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,359
otherwise

1040
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,400
uh the gap is going to be very very

1041
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,319
uh serious which separates

1042
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,240
various social groups from the point of

1043
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,839
view of

1044
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:39,279
skill levels and and the competitiveness

1045
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,839
on the labor market in

1046
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,560
in in the future if i compare the

1047
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,839
current crisis with the previous one

1048
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,000
i'm sure you also remember there was a

1049
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,000
an enormously high level of use

1050
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,920
unemployment in the previous crisis

1051
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,320
that's why we had to come forward with

1052
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,720
policies like the youth guarantee

1053
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,000
and by the way slovakia was also one of

1054
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,040
the countries

1055
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,560
where it had to be rolled out very very

1056
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,839
quickly and but at least at that time

1057
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,920
the narrative was

1058
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,920
that the new generation is very well

1059
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,760
trained the key question is how they are

1060
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,680
connected with the labor market

1061
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,160
and i think now because of the covet

1062
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,078
crisis there is a new narrative

1063
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,960
because if the extraordinary

1064
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,359
circumstances continue for too long

1065
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,119
we will not be able to say that the new

1066
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,160
generation is better trained than the

1067
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,000
previous one

1068
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,000
because the damage is going to be

1069
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,960
serious and long-lasting

1070
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,839
so somehow reinventing proper schooling

1071
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,160
and training

1072
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,560
under the current circumstances also by

1073
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,440
using the opportunities of

1074
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,480
investing from eu funds is going to be

1075
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,319
absolutely

1076
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,000
crucial thank you i just want to remind

1077
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,000
the audience that you can submit

1078
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,200
questions and we'll get to them in just

1079
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,960
a few minutes um alexander one thing

1080
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,640
that i found really interesting is when

1081
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,880
you talked about

1082
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,200
how well the public administration has

1083
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,960
done from from your perspective

1084
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,960
during the beginning of the crisis for

1085
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,440
the private sector i was wondering if

1086
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,520
there's anything that you think the eu

1087
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,839
should be doing that would help the

1088
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,560
banking sector in central europe

1089
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,520
get through this crisis or perhaps um

1090
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,839
recover

1091
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,839
um following the crisis

1092
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,359
well in principle i think uh the banking

1093
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,119
union is very much

1094
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,640
influenced on a european uh basis so

1095
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,960
when we were having this kind of

1096
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,078
discussion there was a very close

1097
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,720
coordination

1098
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,359
with the european central banks and most

1099
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,000
of our

1100
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,160
uh systemic relevant banks are anyhow

1101
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,319
under direct supervision of ecb

1102
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,440
so from this perspective point of view

1103
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,839
um

1104
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,440
i think there is a lot done there is

1105
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,680
still a lot to be done

1106
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,839
but this goes beyond uh let's say

1107
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,078
banking regulation as such

1108
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,960
it is very much important to have also

1109
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,240
uh common

1110
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,319
uh legislative principles

1111
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,720
and so on which would for instance have

1112
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,440
to go on with uh cross-borders

1113
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,480
uh mergers and this type of stuff but

1114
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,440
maybe coming back

1115
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,079
to this uh unique opportunity which we

1116
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,160
have

1117
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,359
right now in particular slovakia has

1118
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,879
right now to

1119
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,598
get out from the uh mid uh mid-income

1120
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,720
trap the

1121
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,520
so classical uh mid middle income

1122
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,359
uh trap is really we need to transform

1123
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,800
in a knowledge based uh

1124
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:36,240
economy and this clearly as uh both

1125
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,960
of my uh fellow uh partners here uh were

1126
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,000
saying

1127
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,960
uh laszlo and prague it is very crucial

1128
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,040
that we talk about

1129
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,960
education and that goes from the

1130
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,160
kindergarten goes to the

1131
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,520
primary secondary school and goes also

1132
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,598
to obviously the university education

1133
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,640
it is very much important the link to

1134
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,280
the private sector

1135
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,640
as it was mentioned as well so from this

1136
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,560
the human capital

1137
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,839
and we need to create that and we don't

1138
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,400
have it right now

1139
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,160
we are not ready to face the challenge

1140
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,000
at least

1141
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,359
in the regions we are operating so there

1142
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,440
are huge challenges

1143
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,880
besides this what i would say another

1144
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,920
crucial factor

1145
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,040
is to create a proper

1146
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,800
business climate which means that

1147
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,200
we have an easy way how to um

1148
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,680
to do this uh research and development

1149
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,640
to bring in innovation to bring in new

1150
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,078
ideas to test new ideas not all of them

1151
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,560
will work out

1152
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,040
so there will be also failures naturally

1153
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,599
but so that we can really facilitate

1154
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,279
this

1155
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,520
and this uh institutional setting

1156
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,480
which currently is missing and i think

1157
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,200
there is also

1158
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,760
where public administration uh quality

1159
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,680
of public

1160
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,200
administration is very much needed to

1161
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,118
favor this because

1162
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,399
this will create the environment which

1163
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,440
will be allowing us

1164
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,960
to transform in a knowledge-based

1165
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,960
economy which is necessary

1166
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,839
um before we go into the questions um

1167
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,680
sonia if you would like to quickly have

1168
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,160
a last word we've heard a lot of

1169
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,839
ideas about how economies can be

1170
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,839
transformed and strengthened

1171
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,000
from your perspective as an economist

1172
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,720
what are the core lessons what needs to

1173
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,160
change

1174
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:26,319
for central europe's economies

1175
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:29,359
um so i mean every country is different

1176
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,599
and there is no one one size fits all

1177
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,359
in terms of innovation strategy that

1178
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,839
works um

1179
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,839
for every country but i am quite

1180
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,359
fascinated by the proposition

1181
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,200
proposition of a um um

1182
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,598
leading author her name is mariana

1183
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,960
matsukato and she has been basically

1184
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,240
arguing

1185
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,599
um in favor of governments taking a more

1186
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,240
active role

1187
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,599
in innovation strategies and that they

1188
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,799
could be

1189
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,480
more active market co-creators uh not

1190
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,599
only market fixers

1191
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,000
so to say and this is also related to

1192
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,560
another

1193
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,800
recent trend uh the recent proliferation

1194
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,759
of strategic ppps that have worked

1195
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,560
really well

1196
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,800
they are longer term uh public private

1197
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,599
partnerships they are bigger in scope

1198
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,520
and i think they're trying to address

1199
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,880
big challenges such as combating climate

1200
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,160
change unemployment

1201
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,599
or um you know at the technological

1202
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,118
frontiers such as

1203
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,880
uh focusing on industrial strategy

1204
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,800
and i think they have worked because

1205
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,440
they're they're mutually beneficial they

1206
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,440
reduce

1207
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,040
risk for the private sector and they

1208
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,599
also enable governments

1209
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,359
to harness private sectors on the ground

1210
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,520
uh creative capacity

1211
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,279
and maximize gains from research

1212
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,800
investments at the times of

1213
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,200
constrained budget so i think this is

1214
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,200
also very important um

1215
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,640
in the current times in the current

1216
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,279
environment

1217
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,680
um also governments need to be asking

1218
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,480
them

1219
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,640
themselves the right questions so where

1220
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,560
in the economy for example

1221
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,480
to focus the innovation and the

1222
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,880
upgrading of domestic capacities to

1223
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,359
achieve

1224
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,680
leap frogging in terms of productivity

1225
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,640
and greater value added

1226
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,560
and in the central european context um

1227
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,960
where a significant part of the

1228
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,480
gdp is associated with global value

1229
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,200
chains police makers should

1230
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,319
concern themselves with how domestic

1231
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,839
firms can capture

1232
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:28,000
greater share of um higher value added

1233
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,680
and of course the success of any

1234
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,200
innovation strategy depends on

1235
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,919
governance and execution

1236
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,680
so you know like-minded coalition may

1237
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,960
partly fill in the void where

1238
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,000
for example political leadership uh

1239
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,880
is either short-sighted or is

1240
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,400
not really um having it as an imperative

1241
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,160
the the long-term innovation strategy

1242
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,839
um so i will stop here because i think

1243
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,598
we're running out of time but those were

1244
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,960
just a few examples of innovation

1245
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,920
strategy that can

1246
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,480
that can be helpful and that central

1247
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,800
europe

1248
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,800
and other regions can rely upon

1249
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,160
great thank you so much everyone um i

1250
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,800
don't actually

1251
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,040
see any questions so unless the

1252
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,599
organizers

1253
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,920
have received any i think we'll leave it

1254
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,640
there for today thank you so much

1255
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,240
alexander sonia laszlo dragos for this

1256
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,920
very interesting conversation i have a

1257
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:32,240
feeling we'll be talking about

1258
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,319
this theme for quite some time thank you

1259
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,950
thank you thank you very much thank you

1260

[Music]

1262
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,839
the opening of the first globsec office

1263
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,480
abroad at the beginning of 2020

1264
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,480
in brussels was a natural step to bring

1265
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,359
the rich experience and expertise of

1266
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,000
globsec

1267
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:56,799
15 years after its creation to the

1268
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,800
lively policy made
