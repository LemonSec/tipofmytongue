my name is robertos and i'm the founder

and president of globsec

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,439
it is my great pleasure to welcome all

8
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,600
of you to the digital stage

9
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,600
i wish you were here in person in

10
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,160
bratislava

11
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,720
but we want to make sure that we create

12
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,000
an excellent experience for you

13
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,920
even without a physical presence this is

14
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,560
the second stage of a special

15
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,199
three-stage concept of globsec 2020

16
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,599
that we have introduced this year the

17
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,920
first stage kicked off during summer

18
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
with a global digital brainstorming of

19
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,880
hundreds of experts

20
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,480
from around the world to identify the

21
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,439
trends that were triggered and

22
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,880
accelerated

23
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,000
by covet 19. today we are kicking off

24
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,360
the second digital stage of gopsek 2020

25
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,519
forum

26
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,399
and the third stage will pick up in

27
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,959
october

28
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,639
with our hybrid physical and virtual

29
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,079
conference

30
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,560
let me make three quick points

31
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,399
first kovit 19 has accelerated the

32
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,479
digital transformation

33
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,839
of all of our institutions including

34
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
lopsec

35
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,160
the digital transformation created an

36
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,000
opportunity for those

37
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,680
who are not in the big cities in the big

38
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,199
centers

39
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,199
because in the digital domain the

40
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,800
physical distance does not matter

41
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,760
it does not matter whether you are in

42
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,760
bratislava new york or brussels

43
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,319
because we can all participate at the

44
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,079
same event at the same exercise

45
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,040
actually we can better connect and

46
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,120
combine the global intellectual power

47
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,680
we are not encumbered by traffic on the

48
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,160
street or delayed by a train

49
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,719
we don't do not need to waste time

50
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,639
commuting or traveling to the conference

51
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,360
today

52
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,639
second the world will not be the same

53
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,920
after covet 19

54
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,040
and you all know this this is not only a

55
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,199
health crisis

56
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,279
this is a multi-dimensional and

57
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,599
transformational crises

58
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,480
that is changing our world it has

59
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
triggered

60
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,920
an accelerated trend that will have

61
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,320
lasting effect

62
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,079
on our lives and our international

63
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
environment

64
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,758
we still do not know exactly how the

65
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,880
world will look like

66
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:48,160
after the end of pandemic but we know

67
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,639
that it will not be the same we need to

68
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,600
design

69
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,360
new strategies new reality and that is

70
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,560
why we have initiated a global

71
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,440
brainstorming

72
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,119
on the postcobit world the globsec

73
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,680
megatrends brainstorming

74
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,279
and subsequent report to be published in

75
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,758
september

76
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,079
will help to identify those trends and

77
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,560
find policy solutions for them

78
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,479
hundreds of experts have participated in

79
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,359
this exercise so far

80
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,920
and you can still be part by filling up

81
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,920
the form

82
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,000
that you can find our web on our web

83
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,120
page globsec.org

84
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,120
third during the pandemic we have seen

85
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,959
a huge crisis of international

86
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,720
cooperation and international

87
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,719
institutions

88
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
but we need international cooperation

89
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,399
more than ever

90
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,199
because we cannot fight the global

91
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,000
pandemic

92
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,199
locally only if we close down in our

93
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,480
borders

94
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,240
i'm convinced that only together we can

95
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
heal the world

96
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
so please stay with us for the upcoming

97
00:16:48,320 --> 00:17:05,839
three days

98
00:16:49,360 --> 00:17:05,839
and let us heal the world together

high-profile

121
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,640
thought-provoking speakers and even

122
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,760
though we unfortunately cannot meet in

123
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,559
bratislava

124
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,360
the digital stage is clearly no

125
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,160
exception

126
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,879
i'm very delighted to welcome the

127
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
president

128
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,799
of estonia kirsty kaliulites

129
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,160
as well as one of the foremost global

130
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,720
thinkers out there

131
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,960
robert kaplan who also holds the robert

132
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,720
schraus who pay chair in geopolitics at

133
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,840
the foreign policy research

134
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,919
institute at the moment and the pandemic

135
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,520
as robert vars said of course correctly

136
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,200
is disrupted the way

137
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,400
we socialize we work we fu we govern

138
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,000
and this health and economic crisis has

139
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,919
certainly far-reaching

140
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,880
implications for our future

141
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,160
madam presidents uh let's let's get

142
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,640
right into it

143
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
um at the end of the day you are of

144
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,600
course

145
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,000
leading estonia a nation of 1.3 million

146
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,879
people

147
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,480
if we look at the figures uh estonia has

148
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,000
a little over 2 000

149
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,320
cases and 64 deaths

150
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
just judging by those numbers seems to

151
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
be quite a successful

152
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,679
management display it's by your

153
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,799
administration has covet been the

154
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,240
biggest challenge

155
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,240
in your presidency so far

156
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,120
definitely so if you look at

157
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,559
the preparedness which nobody could have

158
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,159
for this crisis

159
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,399
but indeed overall because we had

160
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,520
a lot of warning here in north europe we

161
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,559
have managed to

162
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,760
protect our people a little bit better

163
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,799
than maybe in

164
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,440
in other countries again i am reluctant

165
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,559
to say

166
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,520
that it is anything but luck

167
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,879
because after all pandemic started in

168
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,799
southern europe and

169
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,559
hence we could learn a lot to prepare a

170
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,080
lot better already

171
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,158
despite that of course for us

172
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,039
economically estonia is a small open

173
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,360
economy and

174
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,960
80 percent of our economy is related to

175
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,000
uh exports

176
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,720
so uh of course it is a huge

177
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,159
hit to our economy which certainly and

178
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,760
definitely means that there are

179
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,080
challenges ahead

180
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
on the other hand we are a digital

181
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,000
services economy and

182
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,559
the fastest growing part of estonian

183
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,919
economy has been our startups

184
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,760
so maybe they can weather this storm

185
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,919
really well

186
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,080
yeah indeed and many of those elements

187
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,520
we will of course talk in more detail

188
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,678
during this session but let me go to

189
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,600
robert kaplan robert you're coming to us

190
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,280
from massachusetts quite a different

191
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,039
story kesley khalil

192
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,399
the president just said we've managed it

193
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,640
quite well

194
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,799
quite a different story in the united

195
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,919
states almost 6 million

196
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:01,120
covet cases and 180

197
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,039
000 casualties now

198
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,760
of course many presidents or all

199
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,480
presidents are defined by the crisis

200
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,320
they are met so this could have been a

201
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,520
very important moment in time

202
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,320
for president donald trump has he risen

203
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,080
to the occasion uh

204
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,360
first of all it's a great pleasure to be

205
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
here at globe sec

206
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,959
even though it's virtual um i wish it

207
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,320
were in person

208
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,600
uh no president trump has not risen to

209
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,158
the challenge

210
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,120
this was a particular challenge that

211
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,320
required

212
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,760
exceptional organization

213
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,879
and direction from the white house

214
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,679
organizing the responses of the various

215
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,200
state governors the various federal

216
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,280
agencies

217
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:53,120
expert groups etc to do deconfliction

218
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,080
and to kind of coordinate it all

219
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,158
so that required a very organized white

220
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,879
house and white house staff

221
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,720
and president trump's administration is

222
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,559
the opposite of that

223
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,840
um so it's been somewhat of a

224
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:11,039
catastrophe

225
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,280
see big countries like the united states

226
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,158
can afford to make mistakes and have

227
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,200
even bad

228
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,600
government at times um it's much harder

229
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,799
for smaller countries they have no

230
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,879
they have no margin for error in this or

231
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,039
many other

232
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,480
geopolitical crises um it's

233
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:33,280
interesting that president obama who

234
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
um who had his faults he certainly had

235
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,480
his flaws

236
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,520
was a very cerebral organized

237
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,240
um uh you know obsessive man in many

238
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,360
ways

239
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,520
and therefore this crisis ironically

240
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,479
would have you know would have been

241
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,918
perfect

242
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,000
for his abilities but you know crises

243
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,200
don't always match the president

244
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,440
um that we get so i think that the pre

245
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,440
that the current president has not done

246
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,960
well with this crisis

247
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,080
and that this is why for the moment at

248
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,840
least

249
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,960
opponent is way in the polls

250
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,480
for the november election and the

251
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,440
november election of course

252
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,600
is on everyone's mind before we get into

253
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,480
the major trends that have emerged

254
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,520
from this pandemic robert let me just

255
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,480
follow up quickly

256
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,240
and say looking at the socio-economic

257
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,640
problems that the united states

258
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,240
is facing due to the pandemic there are

259
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,600
a lot of people out there who say that

260
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,240
corvette as a matter of fact

261
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,360
has actually exposed the united states

262
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
has exposed

263
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,600
the nation with many socio-economic

264
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,120
shortcomings such as public health

265
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,000
inadequate labor protection

266
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,000
racial tensions meaning has exposed the

267
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,240
united states as a third world

268
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
you know as as a you know first uh

269
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,080
well what do you make of this argument

270
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,799
uh would you go as far as to say

271
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,559
look um comparison is the beginning of

272
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:07,279
all serious scholarship and analysis and

273
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,039
just yesterday it came out in a big

274
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,080
heavily researched piece

275
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,200
by the wall street journal that china's

276
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,918
economy is

277
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,600
moving ahead it was particularly the

278
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,960
very draconian

279
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,158
measures against colbit that china took

280
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,880
very early earlier in the year which of

281
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,720
course

282
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,400
is the you know is the luxury of

283
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,279
authoritarian regimes can do things that

284
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,320
democracies can't but nevertheless

285
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:39,279
due to the extreme draconian measures

286
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,559
china took earlier in the year china's

287
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,520
economy is now

288
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,000
opening up and starting is at the

289
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,039
beginning of surging forward they even

290
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,720
see a positive growth rate for china

291
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:56,080
in 20 in 2020 by the end of the year

292
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,200
so in comparative terms um

293
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,600
covid 19 has exposed

294
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,480
the the administration and american

295
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,320
society to various weaknesses

296
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,120
and it has provided um an advantage for

297
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,559
the uh for america's geopolitic chief

298
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,760
geopolitical

299
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:18,799
rival uh china so and this is just the

300
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,400
beginning the tip of the iceberg of how

301
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,600
covid is going to help some countries in

302
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,000
areas of the world

303
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,799
hurt other countries and areas of the

304
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,440
world

305
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,918
in this you know in this geopolitical

306
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,600
competition we can get into a bit later

307
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,520
i assume

308
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,959
for sure madam president we of course

309
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,600
have to talk about

310
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,120
europe as well the european union um

311
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,760
international cooperation

312
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,360
is always a tomb is always a term that

313
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,360
is being thrown around

314
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,799
when talking about the union but we've

315
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,600
seen very little

316
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,200
cooperation within the european union

317
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,039
since the start of the pandemic haven't

318
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,080
we we've seen as a matter of fact more

319
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,158
nationalism

320
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,520
emerging almost every country was out

321
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,159
there fighting

322
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,279
on its own and a lot of international

323
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,760
observers are saying

324
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,679
that uh covet has not brought the eu

325
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,520
together quite on the country it has

326
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,200
increased the fragmentation within the

327
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,240
union would you concur

328
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,679
no are you alone behind the curve just

329
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,159
yesterday for example

330
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,440
my government together with other eu

331
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,679
countries

332
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,000
have been able to start signing

333
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,840
agreements for vaccine purchases and

334
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,760
and we have agreements in place how we

335
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,840
will distribute these resources which

336
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,679
will initially also be scarce

337
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,000
so that all countries will be able to

338
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,640
benefit and and most

339
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,720
make the most vulnerable groups and

340
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,840
health care providers secure from the

341
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,400
kobe 19 for example let me remind you

342
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,639
europe doesn't have a social pillar

343
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
hence all the work which european union

344
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,640
is doing

345
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,760
in the social sphere is greenfield let

346
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,919
me remind you that

347
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,600
indeed when initially the countries

348
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,600
closed their borders in panic

349
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,918
and this was true panic and indeed the

350
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,799
information was just about who is doing

351
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,960
what

352
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,240
european union and its commission

353
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,400
quickly started to

354
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,159
uh to organize green roots so that at

355
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,200
least goods could pass through

356
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:18,000
and and the transfer of goods resumed

357
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,039
really quickly let me also remind you

358
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,279
that

359
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,559
european union has some really good

360
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,039
tools to uh

361
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,639
to fight this pandemic for example it

362
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,640
has an aids

363
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,480
identification system which allows

364
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,840
people from various and different

365
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,559
eu countries to sign documents legally

366
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,559
so that

367
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,320
we don't need to gather in the same room

368
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,120
or go to the military office

369
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,918
in order to uh to be able to keep doing

370
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,158
business

371
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,000
but i would also like to respond a

372
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,559
little bit to this

373
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,120
question which was written by mr kaplan

374
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,279
about

375
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,199
democratic states opportunities and

376
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,279
possibilities in pandemics compared to

377
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,679
totalitarian regimes

378
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,840
i've been talking to many high school

379
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,720
students during this pandemic here in

380
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,520
neptunia

381
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,320
and what we have collectively concluded

382
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,200
is

383
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,000
that totalitarian regimes may seemingly

384
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,000
have

385
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,120
easier ways to close down shops

386
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
close down streets i mean limit contacts

387
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,279
between people

388
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and so on but democratic nations

389
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,520
by disseminating information and

390
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
convincing people

391
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,600
can make their societies in far more

392
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,880
sustainable way

393
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,840
and with people feeling far less loss of

394
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,840
freedoms

395
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,158
to achieve the same results which has

396
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,240
been demonstrated very well by

397
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,200
many countries in northern and eastern

398
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,159
europe

399
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,039
we have risen as a nation against this

400
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,120
enemy

401
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,559
yes we have many political differences

402
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,639
in this country as well and our

403
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,000
political debate is as fierce

404
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,279
as is in us but in face of this

405
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,799
disseminating information and making

406
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,039
people really aware

407
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,080
that this is the test of citizenship the

408
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,440
test of citizen

409
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,559
responsibility each and every one acts

410
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,520
according to their own risk market risk

411
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,200
matrix and based on this risk matrix we

412
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,520
act together as a nation

413
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,559
and in two weeks time we see how we

414
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,000
collectively manage

415
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,399
it's a huge lesson in citizenship

416
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,559
and citizen responsibility and this is

417
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,799
how we have taken this lesson here

418
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:29,760
in addition and again here in europe

419
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,840
we have been using a little bit having

420
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,200
social market economies really had an

421
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,678
advantage

422
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,919
in general in this pandemic because our

423
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,320
health care system is indeed this it is

424
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,720
a national good it is a national health

425
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,840
care

426
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,679
system it is not an a high number of

427
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,918
agreements millions of agreements

428
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,960
between people and companies to

429
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,520
guarantee their

430
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,200
health care we don't deal with diseases

431
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,918
only in these countries here in europe

432
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,159
we deal

433
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,760
with health care systems and i believe

434
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,360
this has shown

435
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,440
in this pandemic some advantages

436
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,439
india and robert vash and both president

437
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,679
carl eulight have now spoken in length

438
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,880
about some of the lessons that have been

439
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,919
learned throughout

440
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,679
this pandemic robert kaplan

441
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,360
what are some of the lessons what are

442
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,159
some of the main trends that you have

443
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,039
been emerging

444
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,559
since observing since the start of the

445
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,840
pandemic

446
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:27,440
um what i see is that co

447
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,520
you know historians love chapter breaks

448
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,000
and covid19 is a very symbolic chapter

449
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,679
break

450
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,320
between what i call globalization 1.0

451
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,279
and globalization 2.0 globalization 1.0

452
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,039
is basically

453
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,120
a good news story friendly to optimists

454
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,200
it's about the spread of democracy

455
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,158
around the world the spread of free

456
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,559
markets the creation and enlargement of

457
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,559
middle

458
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:59,120
classes the eradication of extreme

459
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,760
poverty in many parts of the world about

460
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,799
global

461
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,000
supply chains all of that remember when

462
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,200
the cold war ended

463
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,600
and globalization 1.0 started nobody had

464
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,279
iphones nobody was even on the internet

465
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,879
practically so globalization 1.0

466
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,519
is a good news story globalization 2.0

467
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,600
is different global and globalization

468
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,039
2.0 i would say began

469
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,158
before covert 19 but thinking of covert

470
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,640
19 is just

471
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,760
you know a symbolic chapter break

472
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,519
globalization

473
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,760
2.0 is about the disruption of global

474
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,440
supply chains the creation of more

475
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,200
national supply chains you know the

476
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,640
disentangling of the u.s and china you

477
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,000
know the decoupling of the u.s and china

478
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,880
supply chains about the rise of populism

479
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,559
the rise of authoritarianism which we

480
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,320
thought we had beaten

481
00:31:52,559 --> 00:32:00,399
um and and also the rise

482
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:03,439
the formation of geopolitical rivalry

483
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:07,279
which nobody which the elite

484
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,000
did not take seriously in the 1990s

485
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,760
um we're entering a more fractured kind

486
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
of globalization

487
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:19,279
as the u.s and china seem increasingly

488
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,159
alienated from each other and

489
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,519
the u.s and russia are extremely

490
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,159
alienated their relationship is

491
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:29,360
dysfunctional

492
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,159
um um and and and and

493
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,360
china and russia are what i call very

494
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,399
wary

495
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,199
tactical allies um

496
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,320
and so um and so this is gonna be a

497
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,880
story that's less

498
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,399
friendly to optimists like globalization

499
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,279
1.0

500
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,918
and is going to and it's and it's go and

501
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,880
furthermore

502
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,919
one other thing which is crises put

503
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,279
history on

504
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,000
fast forward uh what would take five

505
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,679
years to

506
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,320
unravel in iran will only take two years

507
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,720
what took what would take five years to

508
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,879
happen in the persian gulf in israel

509
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,320
would only take one or two years

510
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,240
and on and on around the world so covet

511
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,360
19 has ignited

512
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,039
kind of crisis situations in so many

513
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,080
dozens of countries

514
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,720
um you know it's it's hard to grasp

515
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,480
fully the news doesn't have room for it

516
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,320
in a way and

517
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,360
therefore um uh we're gonna once this

518
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,600
pandemic subsides and people can

519
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,719
gather in the streets more without

520
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,600
feeling fear

521
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,399
of infecting each other i think we're

522
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,519
going to see

523
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:45,199
a world in with a very

524
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,320
high level of geopolitical activity and

525
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,000
change

526
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,439
um you remember saudi arabia and iran

527
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
both have very troubled regimes

528
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,360
during a period of very low energy

529
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,679
prices

530
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,959
there are great changes that are going

531
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,559
to happen

532
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:09,039
that will all be at least partially

533
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,038
derivative of this pandemic

534
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,599
certainly covet 19 has not given us a

535
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,799
breather on the international stage

536
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,919
evident by

537
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,639
events in belarus right now obviously in

538
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,679
hong kong

539
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,280
in mali and so on and so forth uh um

540
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,800
kirshikali a lot you just heard robert

541
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,200
kaplan sort of putting it in

542
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,119
in long-term perspective and his

543
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,040
expectations as to what the world will

544
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,399
look like once the fog

545
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,639
fades are you in agreement or

546
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,638
are there points that you would disagree

547
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,639
with

548
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,079
well first of all i do agree with the

549
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,879
acceleration of the

550
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,760
of the various developments and and with

551
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,520
the uh

552
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,359
shortening of technological cycle

553
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,839
obviously i mean this is this is

554
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,918
this is there and we can see i believe

555
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,040
that the future perspective really

556
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,520
depends

557
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,359
more how we can make use of the good and

558
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,440
positive trends which were already

559
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,680
ongoing before the kovite crisis

560
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,040
and which we could enhance if we are

561
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,000
smart about it

562
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,880
and i'm here meaning um that if i take

563
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,079
this globalization 1.0 and and the new

564
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,839
globalization

565
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,280
metaphor then i would say that the new

566
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,160
globalization relates to the services

567
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,320
markets

568
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,720
the first wave of globalization was

569
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,280
mostly limited to trade and goods goods

570
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,640
produced

571
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,960
in cheap parts of the world and

572
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,359
therefore and then exported and sold in

573
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,400
the

574
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:33,520
in the in the richer countries

575
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,000
now we see that with digitalization of

576
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,920
the services for example if you need to

577
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,119
watch i don't know warehouse temperature

578
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,480
and and

579
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,400
humidity or even a border of our country

580
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,480
you don't need to hire anybody from your

581
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,680
own country you can hire somebody from

582
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,560
afar to monitor this situation at the

583
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,960
same time

584
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,119
in the delivery of of goods we see

585
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,320
regionalization this was ongoing again

586
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,440
already before the

587
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,520
uh kovid pandemic and even before

588
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,560
president trump became the president

589
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,320
and and and the questions about

590
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,560
how free the trade should be and how

591
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,599
global the trade should be started to be

592
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,599
asked again louder this was ongoing

593
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,440
mainly because new technologies

594
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,599
allowed uh well uh the production change

595
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,800
to be changed this way but somewhere

596
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,880
somebody designed

597
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,839
and then you could take this design out

598
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,839
and uh somewhere

599
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,400
right

600
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,598
i'm not sure if it's just me but i'm

601
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,520
actually not hearing

602
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,680
madame president right now is it just me

603
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,440
i'm not here

604
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,040
i'm not going to hear me again or you

605
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,920
didn't hear anything there you go

606
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,920
there you go i'm pretty sure there was

607
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,520
absolutely no sabotage in what you were

608
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,400
just saying to cover up what you were

609
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,759
just saying

610
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,440
so so let no let's hear it again

611
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,520
question justice how long didn't you

612
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,640
hear me

613
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,960
uh i would say 60 seconds

614
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,520
yeah okay that's not too long then i

615
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,400
would start from here like i said but

616
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,960
with this globalization of the uh of the

617
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,760
uh

618
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,760
services market we see also the rise of

619
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,680
an independent worker we are used to

620
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,520
thinking in this industrial

621
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,720
manner that people need to gather into

622
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,680
enterprises

623
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,399
to be more productive and only this way

624
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,919
we can

625
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,320
we can achieve better wealth for

626
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,920
societies but we now see that there are

627
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
more and more there are millions of

628
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,320
people

629
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,000
independently offering their services

630
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,160
online and they are working

631
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,119
in different countries at the same time

632
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,118
they are

633
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,960
highly skilled they are narrowly

634
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,839
specialized and they can be

635
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,560
wherever and i think we really need to

636
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,119
start

637
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,759
rethinking about how we see economy as a

638
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,079
whole

639
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,320
because this industrial model is broken

640
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,960
the new global services market is coming

641
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,880
in

642
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,240
the services and boards are getting

643
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,119
intertwined and

644
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,839
and actually uh i mean the the part of

645
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,839
good

646
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,040
in the whole production chain is lesser

647
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,799
than it used to be

648
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,960
the number of people working in

649
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,359
industrial real will fall to maybe

650
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,000
something like we see now in agriculture

651
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,640
and the person is more powerful on the

652
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,280
market

653
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,118
and if we can play these trends well

654
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,320
then actually i believe that the power

655
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,400
of people

656
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,160
will help us to counterbalance these

657
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,200
geopolitical big trends

658
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,240
i'm sorry to say that the time when 15

659
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,240
big men somewhere in one room or

660
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:41,040
20 or 7 decided everything is gone

661
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,799
the new world is really really clearly

662
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,200
on polar world

663
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,640
and indeed quite evident by the fact

664
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,319
that robert kaplan

665
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,879
is joining us from massachusetts you're

666
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,560
in tallinn i'm in berlin and here we are

667
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,160
having this conversation about the

668
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,200
future your country of course madam

669
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,520
president was

670
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,118
even before covet 19 was a frontrunner

671
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,000
if not even a role model

672
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,200
when it came to digitalization how to do

673
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,920
it well

674
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,640
do you think countries like yours are

675
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,480
now

676
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,160
successfully in a position a pole

677
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,960
position perhaps even

678
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:18,560
to succeed in what comes next

679
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,240
i was able to uh serve my state as an

680
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,799
advisor to prime minister when

681
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,560
digitalization in estonia started

682
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,960
and we thought we will have five years

683
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,799
of advantage and then the big ones

684
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,040
will come rolling over our small

685
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,599
advantages which we have created and

686
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,480
and if we do start quickly we may be

687
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,119
able to have

688
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,440
but the rest will have in ten years with

689
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,480
somewhat less cost to the state

690
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,359
how long long we were it's 20 years on

691
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,480
and still we don't see the basics in

692
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,680
place for

693
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,680
for digital uh service provision

694
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,078
globally and i'm not only meaning

695
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,759
a public service provision by which

696
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,560
estonia is mostly known

697
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,640
but i believe that all kind of safe and

698
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,960
secure service provision in internet

699
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,440
depends on safe identification

700
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,200
so as long as the world as a whole fails

701
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,319
to recognize that there is not only a

702
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,720
paper passport

703
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,800
but the digital identity or a digital

704
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,759
passport which will allow us to act and

705
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,119
transact

706
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,160
in an identified form online

707
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,960
these market cannot be totally open for

708
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,118
everybody

709
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,560
and that's where i believe where europe

710
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,280
is ahead because

711
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,720
because europe has been able to

712
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,280
recognize the need

713
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,359
and has started to put into place the

714
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,240
system of mutual recognition of digital

715
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,240
identities

716
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,000
without this becoming global at least

717
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,319
for developed economies it is very

718
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,560
hard to foresee how the power of

719
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,400
technology could really be unleashed

720
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,078
in order to create economic development

721
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,800
particularly at the times

722
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,160
and i don't think kobe 19 will be over

723
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,400
and then nothing like this will ever

724
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,399
happen i think in the future looking at

725
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,079
the depletion of ecosystems and other

726
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,599
problems we face on this planet this

727
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,839
will keep happening

728
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,839
we need to be able to serve each other

729
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,000
indeed this title robert this session is

730
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,160
titled the world

731
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,040
afrikovit i think we all wish we'd

732
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,279
already

733
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,200
be there but we are still in the midst

734
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,079
of a pandemic when this is all said and

735
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,240
done robert

736
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,119
uh which countries which regions do you

737
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,479
think

738
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,480
will be best suited to

739
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,640
come out of this not unscathed but

740
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,119
certainly in a position to carry on and

741
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,118
flourish

742
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,118
um yes i think there's an irony

743
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,599
development

744
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,240
developing we're seeing more and more

745
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,119
great

746
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,919
power rivalry as i said before between

747
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,920
the u.s

748
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,960
china and russia but at the same time

749
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,520
i believe all of these big countries

750
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,880
have

751
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,759
deep internal problems uh

752
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,640
the question is is there even a russian

753
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,760
system

754
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,640
that could replace president putin

755
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,000
uh if putin were to become ill tomorrow

756
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,720
or in five years

757
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,599
is there even a stable system there

758
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,279
china has

759
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:09,680
enormous tensions within its elite

760
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,480
that seem opaque because it's not a

761
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,399
democracy but they're there nevertheless

762
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,560
and they're just as severe as in the

763
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,880
united states of course

764
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,078
in the united states you have severe

765
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,680
internal tensions

766
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,119
as everybody knows uh so all these great

767
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,680
powers could weaken

768
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,599
internally and we could have a world in

769
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,078
the 21st century

770
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,880
where great powers will simply matter

771
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,280
less

772
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,079
and a region like the greater indian

773
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,119
ocean

774
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,599
which is not which is does not have any

775
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,640
great

776
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,520
power on its shores could

777
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,640
could easily become you know a a very

778
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,160
significant

779
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,560
part of the world um the same with

780
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,440
europe and other places so it's kind of

781
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,920
an irony

782
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,000
more and more great power tensions but

783
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,599
the great powers themselves

784
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,079
are much more fragile um that

785
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,800
than than seems than seems to be the

786
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,359
case

787
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,400
and you could have sort of middle level

788
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,160
powers

789
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,800
like germany for instance um exert more

790
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,839
and more

791
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,560
influence in the world in the in between

792
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,520
in the 21st century it's not going to be

793
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,560
a very

794
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,079
clear coherent situation

795
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:29,200
and uh we're not going from one

796
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,920
fro from one period of sort of

797
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,799
imperial like rule to another period

798
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,000
like that

799
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,200
it's the 21st century is going to be

800
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,480
incredibly complex

801
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,480
and power could be incredibly

802
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,480
diversified

803
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,880
very complex uh situation indeed that

804
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,480
is emerging in the 21st century

805
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,000
president calhoun

806
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,440
this may be a bit of a philosophical

807
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,520
question but when the pandemic first

808
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,599
started i've read numerous reports and

809
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,560
essays about how this is the moment for

810
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,119
humanity

811
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,078
for us to come together and overcome our

812
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,400
differences

813
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:08,480
if you look at the landscape today um

814
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,079
has the pandemic has covered 19 really

815
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,240
managed to bring us together

816
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,079
has not has the opposite perhaps not

817
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,640
even taken place has it not

818
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,000
divided us even further due to

819
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,480
socio-economic

820
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,480
hardship

821
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,440
first of all if we look the social

822
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,240
economic hardships and

823
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,800
and economic decline has not yet settled

824
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,118
in

825
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,280
so we don't know yet whether there will

826
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,160
be more protectionist for example or

827
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,160
will

828
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,240
will we globally recognize that

829
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,319
protectionism has never helped us and it

830
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,759
will not help us also in the future

831
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,839
we don't know what will happen in

832
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,160
economy if we look right now what we

833
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,078
have

834
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,240
is i mean lots of money being put into

835
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,200
economy and all this money accumulates

836
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,078
in in assets

837
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,839
real estate or elsewhere so we we are in

838
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,520
the situation where we cannot predict

839
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,759
from past trends what will happen

840
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,480
uh in in economy in this sense and and

841
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:05,119
that means that we may face a new panic

842
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,119
which will then again uh result in

843
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,599
well not so positive trends also for for

844
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,279
us globally

845
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,200
but some things have not changed through

846
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,119
this pandemic and i think

847
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,520
they remain there that was for example

848
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,960
this big trend that

849
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,759
europe was facing up to the geopolitical

850
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,200
reality

851
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,160
of our big regional risk

852
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,078
russia not being any more the global the

853
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,319
risk there is also china

854
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,400
which means that other important players

855
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,000
globally need to look

856
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,319
at those other players as well and

857
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,200
europe has to manage its regional risk

858
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:44,560
itself this has not changed through this

859
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,640
pandemic it will not change

860
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,920
through this pandemic and i'm happy to

861
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,400
say that there is also

862
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,960
no less attention through this pandemic

863
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,760
on this issue if you look uh

864
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,599
the discussions here in europe on uh on

865
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,440
de la russia ursula mandela and the

866
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,760
president of the european commission

867
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,119
was very quick to say that sanctions

868
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,359
could be considered

869
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,880
and europe while not intervening in

870
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,440
internal politics of

871
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,119
belarusia is strongly standing together

872
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,359
and demanding the right of belarusian

873
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,640
people to decide for themselves east or

874
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,119
west democracy

875
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,920
or less democracy seems to be democratic

876
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,160
one they don't have european ambition

877
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,160
and fine is that absolutely fine with

878
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,839
that they need to be able to reside

879
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,399
that is what europe tries to achieve

880
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,920
here so i think some

881
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,160
big trends have not changed and maybe we

882
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,440
are in general overestimating

883
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,399
what has in reality change i still take

884
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,520
this

885
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,640
as a temporary issue in this sense that

886
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,480
i mean it enhances digital trends it

887
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,960
maybe puts our attention

888
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,079
less on geopolitical problems which we

889
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,839
are facing

890
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,079
about which i'm quite sad because i

891
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,040
think we need to look at for example how

892
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,880
nato

893
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,640
is ready to respond to the digital

894
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,920
development of

895
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,160
military forces outside nato and and so

896
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,240
on we have issues with which we need to

897
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,598
need to work and which we are maybe

898
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,160
neglected a little bit

899
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,079
but overall half a year is probably too

900
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,960
short as well

901
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,920
indeed and hopefully this is just a

902
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,119
temporary

903
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:22,079
disruption and uh pan epidemic

904
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,680
robert kaplan um if we're looking at the

905
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,559
major trends if

906
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,960
you were asked by an administration to

907
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,839
give policy recommendations

908
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,000
not just for now but for the time ahead

909
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,680
what would be your top three priorities

910
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,359
for any government at this particular

911
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,000
point to position itself

912
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,720
so that it can come out both

913
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,760
socio-economically strong and viable

914
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,919
um i would say from the from as it

915
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,079
refers to the united states

916
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,040
i would tell the new administration

917
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,800
number one

918
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:59,279
refurbish re-strengthen

919
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:02,240
alliances uh reassure allies

920
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,960
that is the most important thing because

921
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,040
allies

922
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,079
carry so much of the weight and

923
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,359
alleviate

924
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:12,960
a great power of so much of the burden

925
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:16,640
so that that is number one um

926
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:20,000
this the second thing more generally

927
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:23,279
is um it's not a matter of of

928
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,359
a big government or small government

929
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,800
it's a matter of good government of

930
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,520
smart government

931
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,079
of government that is um you know you

932
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,480
know that

933
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,520
listens to experts but where the

934
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,720
politicians make the final decisions

935
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:41,720
um so that um you know you yeah

936
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,879
so it's a matter of getting better at

937
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,799
micromanaging

938
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,760
so to speak because we're going to have

939
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,520
a lot this is not the future the last

940
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,920
pandemic we're going to have we're going

941
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,200
to have

942
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:56,000
lots of issues we could have um you know

943
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,640
cyber attacks on a greater scale than we

944
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,520
have seen

945
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,000
so far you know all this is going to

946
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,119
take

947
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,160
experts to kind of help to help us

948
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,440
through

949
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,520
and the third thing is um

950
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,720
and this is the most important thing

951
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,960
make sure that everybody in your society

952
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,000
has a stake in the outcome

953
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:21,839
that they all feel that they have been

954
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,160
um that they've been taken into account

955
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,759
and have not been brushed aside in other

956
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,720
words on the one hand

957
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,559
strengthen democracy at the lower levels

958
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,520
but at the top end

959
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,200
improve administration uh you know

960
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,280
improve bureaucracy

961
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,839
because um problems are going to come at

962
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,119
us

963
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,799
real fast all kinds of problems

964
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,280
and governments are going to have to

965
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,640
have quick reaction time

966
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,480
and that quick reaction times dispersal

967
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,118
of the responsibility

968
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,440
to under secretaries to assistant

969
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,559
secretaries to deputy assistant

970
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,040
secretaries

971
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,839
so you need the best people in any

972
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,960
system

973
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:09,200
to deal with ongoing crisis crisis

974
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,200
management is going to become permanent

975
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,480
and following up on that president

976
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,559
khalil you've been

977
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,760
in uh office as president since 2016 has

978
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,920
the pandemic

979
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,880
change anything fundamental about the

980
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,880
way you govern

981
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:30,160
me is actually not changed

982
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:32,960
anything in this sense that for example

983
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,000
estonian state reaches out to its people

984
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,000
anyway digitally all our services online

985
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,480
you cannot marry online but that's about

986
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,640
it

987
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,640
people are demanding now already pro

988
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,480
active services which means that if the

989
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,319
state knows that you are entitled to

990
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,359
something for example universal child

991
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,200
support

992
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,279
then the state should not demand you

993
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,960
even online to make a demand but should

994
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,839
automatically reverse you but

995
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,319
what it is due to give you so we were

996
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,520
there

997
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,640
already in this sense what is new uh our

998
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,200
schools of course

999
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,200
had to also quickly adapt and while we

1000
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,598
do have a lot of e-schooling elements in

1001
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,680
it

1002
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,359
we also of course have not tested about

1003
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,640
how we teach our children if they are

1004
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,799
not in the school

1005
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,359
but now we are having debates that maybe

1006
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,160
it's a valuable opportunity to

1007
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,598
have one day a week digital learning

1008
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,920
forever for example

1009
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,000
and we have been seeking to provide for

1010
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,079
our citizens living globally

1011
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,200
which means we have been also developing

1012
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,000
a

1013
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,078
global estonian school and now it has a

1014
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,079
lot of new material in it because our

1015
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,200
teachers were preparing uh

1016
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:40,079
internet courses for several months now

1017
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,480
so in addition to providing the state

1018
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,640
services globally for all estonians you

1019
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,839
can still vote wherever you are etc

1020
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,839
you can still i mean talk to your state

1021
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,520
access your e-health system or this

1022
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,558
while you are yourself in australia if

1023
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,200
you so wish

1024
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,960
we now see that education is following

1025
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,799
these services into the internet this is

1026
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,440
maybe the biggest change and i really

1027
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,440
hope

1028
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,480
that these tools will allow estonian

1029
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,400
children

1030
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,079
whose parents are for example working

1031
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,400
according to the free movement of

1032
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,720
labor in europe somewhere else to fully

1033
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,119
educate themselves in estonian language

1034
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,919
having access to internet so this is an

1035
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,839
enhancement

1036
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,119
we also enhanced our e-health for

1037
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,880
example when people fell

1038
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,319
sick they could start themselves very

1039
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,000
sickly the knee health system they

1040
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,240
didn't have to go to the doctor

1041
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,480
and ask the doctor to do it and so on so

1042
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,200
on but these were modifications and

1043
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,800
upscaling

1044
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,799
it was there already before

1045
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,720
robert kaplan uh for the better part of

1046
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,000
the last

1047
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:41,118
previous uh six months uh the headlines

1048
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,960
have been dominated by the coronavirus

1049
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,040
and as we said before the united states

1050
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,480
of course finds itself in a very

1051
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,880
heated very very contested us

1052
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,359
election campaign right now is it fair

1053
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,920
to say that covet 19 has changed the

1054
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,720
dynamics of the us elections up until

1055
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,160
then

1056
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,200
donald trump's main ace was the economy

1057
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,440
something that

1058
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,040
he obviously praised himself for

1059
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,559
numerous times and

1060
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:11,200
so it it as a big biggest asset now

1061
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:14,000
obviously due to the socio-economic

1062
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,799
ramifications of the pandemic the the

1063
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,760
the game has a bit of change would you

1064
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,880
say that

1065
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,520
it it's it's a very decisive factor in

1066
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,280
how

1067
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:29,119
americans will vote in november

1068
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,040
absolutely uh colbert 19 is the crisis

1069
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,319
that has defined the trump

1070
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,920
administration

1071
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:38,558
had there been no covid19 just think of

1072
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,559
the world we would be without covert 19

1073
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,960
regarding your question on the u.s

1074
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,440
elections the american economy would be

1075
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,640
the strongest that it's ever been

1076
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,400
um you would not uh uh um

1077
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,480
you know the president would have gone

1078
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,640
through four years without something

1079
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,079
like the iraq war

1080
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,799
or you know or some massive foreign

1081
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,720
crisis

1082
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,240
that you know that would have defined

1083
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,959
him it was actually

1084
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:08,640
despite all the media um

1085
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,640
hyperventilation about president trump

1086
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,598
the impeachment trials

1087
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,640
all of that nothing that much has

1088
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,720
happened

1089
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,520
in the first three years of the trump

1090
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:23,200
administration it was just a growing

1091
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:26,640
and generating economy covert 19 has

1092
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,480
changed that radically and that will

1093
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,680
um you know and that will affect the

1094
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:35,839
outcome of the election

1095
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:38,640
and uh obviously robert kaplan

1096
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,279
you say the the covet 19 has changed

1097
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,279
everything

1098
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,559
uh as far as the election campaign is

1099
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,000
concerned but what does it

1100
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,880
say uh about the united states if a

1101
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,880
pandemic

1102
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,400
you said this is what the united the

1103
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,000
world and certainly the united states

1104
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,000
would look like if the pandemic hadn't

1105
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,319
happened what does it say about the us

1106
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,160
if a pandemic and within such a short

1107
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:00,319
amount of time can throw the country so

1108
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,279
off the rails

1109
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:04,480
um i think it's a culmination of

1110
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,119
something

1111
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,720
that people in washington have been on

1112
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,400
and around the country have been

1113
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,598
unwilling to face

1114
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:16,880
which is america has had a crisis

1115
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,480
of leadership going back to the end of

1116
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,520
the cold war

1117
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,720
america's cold war presidents

1118
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:28,240
from president harry truman to president

1119
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:31,839
george h.w bush have been

1120
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:34,640
on the whole far superior

1121
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,520
especially in foreign affairs than

1122
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,359
america's

1123
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:42,240
cold war a post-cold war presidents from

1124
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:44,480
president bill clinton to donald trump

1125
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,240
there have been variations of course

1126
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,680
that we can argue about but

1127
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,078
as a group america's cold war presidents

1128
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,598
have performed magnificently better than

1129
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,640
its post-cold war

1130
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,480
presidents and that is not an accident

1131
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,640
that reflects to the change in

1132
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,760
washington the change in american

1133
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:05,440
society

1134
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:09,359
etc that that the post-cold war

1135
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:12,640
starting in 1989 has not his nut is

1136
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:13,359
you know it has not been good for

1137
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,000
america

1138
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:18,640
in that sense you know there's a line in

1139
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
ernest hemingway's first novel the sun

1140
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:24,480
also rises where they asked someone

1141
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,200
well when did things start going how did

1142
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,079
things go

1143
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,279
bad for you and the banker said first

1144
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,040
gradually

1145
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:35,680
then suddenly and i think that holds

1146
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,640
true for america's post-cold war

1147
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,960
presidents it was a gradual

1148
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,520
deterioration

1149
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,280
in the quality of administrations and

1150
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,640
then under president trump

1151
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,040
a sudden deterioration

1152
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,640
we have uh we're in the final stretches

1153
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,400
of the opening session we

1154
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,078
have approximately five to six minutes

1155
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,200
left i've been told that we have

1156
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,160
a question from one of our viewers if we

1157
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,879
can get that in

1158
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:05,399
quickly that'd be wonderful so

1159
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,280
yes is this me ian anthony from

1160
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,680
cyprients.com

1161
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,000
um i wanted to ask for your reflections

1162
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:15,200
on how international cooperation can be

1163
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,520
organized in the future

1164
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,200
we've seen during the pandemic that

1165
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,640
there is criticism of international

1166
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,439
institutions

1167
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,440
and the way they perform we don't see

1168
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,599
the world crystallizing at least not yet

1169
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,520
into a sort of block structure

1170
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,440
but instead we have sort of fluid issue

1171
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,599
based coalitions of states around

1172
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,240
specific things whether it's climate

1173
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,240
health military security how can

1174
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,479
institutions reform themselves so that

1175
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,078
they can operate in this world

1176
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,280
will we just see a multiplication of

1177
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,920
institutions even though they're

1178
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,920
criticized

1179
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:53,040
madam president you want to start first

1180
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,599
well i could first of all i know that

1181
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:59,279
sometimes we criticize our multilateral

1182
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,799
organizations be the u.n or our european

1183
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,280
union

1184
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:05,040
for their slewlessness to react for

1185
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,280
their inability to move

1186
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,079
quickly ahead and so on and then i

1187
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,280
always ask

1188
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:14,000
people to compare for example europe who

1189
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,960
is the union to europe without the union

1190
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,880
if we then try to commonly respond to

1191
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,200
for example the challenge which was also

1192
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,880
mentioned in the question climate change

1193
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,720
it will look a little bit like the cop

1194
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,640
procedure i mean we will argue where

1195
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,879
will the next congress be then we will

1196
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,720
argue about how we will take decisions

1197
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,960
and then when we take decisions then

1198
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,000
there is no one to implement them

1199
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:39,200
in european union even if brussels quite

1200
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,160
an often awful looks like it's a mess

1201
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,160
nobody i mean is getting what they want

1202
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,359
and not letting anybody else to get what

1203
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,399
the others want

1204
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:50,480
this is not true we have a system the

1205
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,880
treaty according to which we know when

1206
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,040
we come together who comes together

1207
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,960
how we take decisions and then how we

1208
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,160
implement them thereafter

1209
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,480
and this is how europe has actually

1210
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,799
given the rest of the world hope that

1211
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,760
for example climate change can be fought

1212
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:08,319
successfully because there is no other

1213
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,799
big

1214
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,558
enough and rich enough market which is

1215
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,960
collectively ready to

1216
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,280
exercise such a market distortion like

1217
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,799
climate neutrality by 2050

1218
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,559
and by exercising and i hope in in a way

1219
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,839
where private sector and businesses will

1220
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,319
believe this

1221
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,279
pledge by exercising this market

1222
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:30,400
distortion

1223
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,000
it will make technologies to develop and

1224
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,000
become cheaper and cheaper

1225
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,440
until the rest of the world will use

1226
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,240
them because

1227
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,200
they are feasible i don't see any other

1228
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,279
way for example

1229
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,118
how this planet can be changed if

1230
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,440
european union fails here

1231
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,400
it will be a failure global so this is a

1232
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,520
demonstration

1233
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,680
how a multilateral institution can

1234
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,599
deliver in 21st century

1235
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,960
yes it is the most rigid structure

1236
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:57,200
compared to other multilateral

1237
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,359
organizations for example un

1238
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,040
but despite the fact that people think

1239
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:04,480
it is not moving anywhere

1240
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:07,920
it is if you think about it

1241
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:12,240
robert kaplan uh yes

1242
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:14,640
first of all um the the united nations

1243
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,640
the organization of it the security

1244
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:20,200
council the general assembly

1245
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:23,920
reflects the world as it was in the late

1246
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:25,200
1940s um and the general assembly

1247
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,480
reflects the world

1248
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,799
as it was after the end of

1249
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,720
decolonization

1250
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:33,920
in the 1960s um it would be nice to

1251
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,399
think that the un

1252
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,440
could be radically reorganized to

1253
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,160
reflect the new distribution of power

1254
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,720
and influence in the world today

1255
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,279
unfortunately it will be very hard to do

1256
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,520
that

1257
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,400
without cooperation from the great

1258
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,359
powers

1259
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,720
and cooperation from the great powers

1260
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,880
you know who have seats

1261
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,000
on the security council that's why i

1262
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,559
mentioned them

1263
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,559
you know can only you know has to be

1264
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,680
achieved by their leaders

1265
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,640
so the u.n is a reflection of the world

1266
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,359
at large

1267
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,920
rather than a driver of the world at

1268
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,119
large

1269
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,799
um uh unfort fort unfortunately it's

1270
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,680
like the congress of vienna

1271
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:16,319
in the early 19th century it reflects

1272
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,598
you know that

1273
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:22,640
the power of tensions um but i think

1274
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:24,880
you know that the u.n especially the

1275
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,520
european union

1276
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,559
even nato as much as it has been

1277
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:34,040
disparaged are the building blocks

1278
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,200
for any restitution of international

1279
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,680
cooperation

1280
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,040
in this new age and i would also include

1281
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,319
asean

1282
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,799
in asia our multilateral institutions

1283
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:45,440
are not

1284
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,839
perfect they have a lot of problem but

1285
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,880
they

1286
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:49,599
are there they do function um and

1287
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,160
therefore

1288
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,480
it's best to try to improve them rather

1289
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,799
than to just to disparage them and throw

1290
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,760
them out

1291
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:01,839
we're almost out of time robert kaplan

1292
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,480
60 seconds left i don't want to pass up

1293
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:06,240
the opportunity of course to

1294
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,319
give you the opportunity to look into

1295
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,479
the famous crystal ball and give me your

1296
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:11,759
uh prediction regarding november the

1297
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,920
next session

1298
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,359
that's coming up is titled strengthening

1299
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,720
transatlantic cooperation

1300
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:20,078
times of upheaval at 4 pm cet moderated

1301
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,759
by my esteemed colleague

1302
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,599
steve clements uh what do you think is

1303
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,559
going to happen in november will we see

1304
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,079
a new president

1305
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,599
or four more years of donald trump

1306
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,559
robert kaplan

1307
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,280
um i've always been a believer in the

1308
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,480
silent

1309
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,440
trump voter you know the voter who will

1310
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,680
not

1311
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,480
socially admit that he's going to vote

1312
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,720
for president trump but actually will

1313
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,520
because they feel socially embarrassed

1314
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:48,319
if they do so in public with company

1315
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,240
but the silent trump voter is like two

1316
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,200
three percent of the electorate that

1317
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,479
i'll believe

1318
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:58,160
um but at the moment president biden

1319
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:01,200
uh vice president biden is ahead by

1320
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,160
almost double digits by eight nine ten

1321
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,799
percent

1322
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,960
so that to me means unless there's a

1323
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,599
dramatic shift that will have a new

1324
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,000
president

1325
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:11,839
in november because the silent trump

1326
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,880
voter won't be enough

1327
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:17,359
to overcome that margin

1328
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,160
um you know of course a lot can happen

1329
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:21,119
between now

1330
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,118
and november and um you know even the

1331
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,680
best forecasting agencies

1332
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:26,720
often refuse to predict elections you

1333
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,720
know because they can

1334
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,558
hinge on something that happens at the

1335
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:34,000
very very last minute

1336
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,160
but as of now i would say even with the

1337
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,440
silent trump voter you have to

1338
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,118
give vice president biden the edge

1339
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,799
and we had a bit of a freudian slip

1340
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,720
there calling joe biden already

1341
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,240
crowning him already the president yeah

1342
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:49,520
if not just

1343
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:51,680
verbally no

1344
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,960
no apologies needed whatsoever quite on

1345
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,279
the country the jury's still

1346
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,119
out on the u.s election november but the

1347
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,000
jury is still out on what the world will

1348
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,480
look like

1349
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,240
after covet 19. after having listened to

1350
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,079
both president carl eulight and robert

1351
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,240
kaplan though i think we all got

1352
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,640
gotten great insight into what the

1353
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,879
worlds off the covet 19

1354
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,400
could look like thank you so much to

1355
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,079
both of you president caldwell

1356
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,599
and robert kaplan for your valuable

1357
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,160
insight this wraps up

1358
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,920
the opening session of the globsec 2020

1359
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,640
digital stage it was a pleasure to

1360
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,280
moderate it

1361
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:25,038
and looking forward to see you all again

1362
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,319
in person hopefully before too long all

1363
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,319
the best and stay safe

1364

1365
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,078
globesec bratislava forum is the

1366
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,160
platform to tackle

1367
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:44,880
disruption and discuss solutions for

1368
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,799
better tomorrows

1369
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,079
the basic theme of disruption is crucial

1370
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,680
because to me

1371
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,440
the issue is not whether it's climate

1372
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,720
change or whether it's the chinese or

1373
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,280
the russians or whatever

1374
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,160
it's actually the concatenation the mix

1375
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,440
of them all

1376
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,960
and that's what i think is so valuable

1377
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,839
about this because it is a generalized

1378
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,839
conference
