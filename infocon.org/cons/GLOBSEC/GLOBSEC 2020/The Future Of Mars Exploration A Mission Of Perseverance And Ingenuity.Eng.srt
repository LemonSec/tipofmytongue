good afternoon from brussels

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,720
my name is alex martin and i'm the head

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,119
of globsec brussels office

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,598
i am pleased to introduce this second to

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,400
last session of globsec 2020 digital

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
stage

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,399
we tried for the past days to bring to

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,719
your attention the most relevant

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,640
interesting and actual topics but we

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
decided to go one step further

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,160
and bring to this conference a topic

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,279
which is literally out of our

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,319
coveted world this is the future of mars

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,200
exploration so let's go to mars

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
and we are pleased to have with us dr

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,199
enabled the exploration of deep space

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,400
and novel transportation systems for

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,280
over 20 years

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,360

for the next 20 minutes

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,640
and then we will have the opportunity to

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,759
get a q a chat

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
to get answers uh also to to our tour

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,079
questions

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,079
so anita the floor is yours

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,759
uh good evening everyone from los

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,280
angeles and thank you for having me alex

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,560
at your wonderful conference so

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,320
today i'm going to speak about the

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,560
future of mars exploration

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,240
with a focus on what has been done to

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,479
date and where we're headed as

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,158
a species as we travel towards the red

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,560
planet my name is anita

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,320
gupta and i am an aerospace engineer and

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,680
professor by training so we can go to

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,520
the next slide

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
just to give you a little bit of

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,320
background um we can go to the second

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,560
slide because engineer in the future

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,158
hopefully it's up um so to give you a

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,079
little bit of background about me

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,319
i spent the majority of my career

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,038
working for nasa which is the u.s space

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:11,038
agency

59
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,480
developing technologies to facilitate

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,319
the exploration of space

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,920
and about 15 years ago i had an

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,599
opportunity to work on this amazing

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,679
mission to mars called the mars science

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,959
laboratory curiosity mission which was

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,520
going to send something the size of the

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,280
car

67
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,440
to the surface of mars and i developed

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,959
an expertise on how to land

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,480
spacecraft on the surface of other

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,080
planets and with atmospheres

71
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,079
ironically that's a class that i now

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
teach at my university

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,680
so the talk of my today is going to be

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,680
going through some of my lessons learns

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,680
and some of the challenges that we have

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
as a space agencies from around the

77
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
world to accomplish

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
mars exploration going forward if we go

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,599
to the next slide

80
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,280
the next slide will show you a video of

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
some of the challenges associated with

82
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,440
landing something

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,930
on the surface of mars you can play the

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,760
video now

85

[Music]

86
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,879
when people look at it

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,200
uh it looks crazy

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,560
that's a very natural thing sometimes

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,560
when we look at it

90
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:17,519
it looks crazy it is the result

91
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,850
of reasoned engineering thought

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,560
but it still looks crazy

93
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,440
[Music]

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,070
from the top of the atmosphere down to

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,280
the surface

96
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,720
[Music]

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,799
it takes a seven minutes it takes 14

98
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,000
minutes or so

99
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,319
for the signal from the spacecraft

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,560
to make it to earth that's how far mars

101
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,079
is away from us

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,159
so when we first get word that we've

103
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,720
touched the top of the atmosphere the

104
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,399
vehicle has been alive

105
00:03:48,720 --> 00:04:00,319
or dead on the surface

106
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:01,760
for at least seven minutes android

107
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,920
descent landing

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,359
also known as edl is referred to as a

109
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
seven minutes of terror

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
because we've got literally seven

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
minutes to get

112
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,920
from the top of the atmosphere to the

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,200
surface of mars

114
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,918
going from 13 000 miles an hour to zero

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,120
in perfect sequence perfect choreography

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,798
perfect timing

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,759
and the computer has to do it all by

118
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,960
itself with no help in the ground

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,479
if any one thing doesn't work just right

120
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,680
it's game over we slam into the

121
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,960
atmosphere and develop

122
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,800
so much aerodynamic drag our heat shield

123
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,159
it heats up and it glows like the

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,520
surface of the sun

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,520
1600 degrees

126
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,880
during entry the vehicle is not only

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,599
slowing down

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,360
violently through the atmosphere but

129
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
also we are guiding

130
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
like an airplane to be able to land in a

131
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,000
very narrow

132
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,560
constrained space this is one of the

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,960
biggest

134
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,840
challenges that we're facing and one

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,400
that we have never

136
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,919
attempted on mars mars is actually

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,239
really hard to slow down

138
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,599
because it has just enough atmosphere

139
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,880
that you have to deal with it

140
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,880
otherwise it will destroy your

141
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,280
spacecraft on the other hand

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,120
it doesn't have enough atmosphere to

143
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,719
finish the job

144
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,400
we're still going about a thousand miles

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,520
an hour so

146
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,960
at that point we use a parachute a

147
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,719
parachute is the largest

148
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,159
and strongest supersonic parachute that

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,880
we've ever built to date

150
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,080
it has to be able to withstand 65 000

151
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
pounds of force even though the

152
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,479
parachute itself

153
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,479
only weighs about 100 pounds

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,199
when it opens up that fast it's a neck

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,120
snapping nine g's

156
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,039
at that point we have to get that heat

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,880
shield off it's like a big lens cap

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,520
blocking our view of the ground to the

159
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,280
radar

160
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,120
the radar has to take just the right

161
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,559
altitude and velocity measurements at

162
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,240
just the right time

163
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
or the rest of the landing sequence

164
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,720
won't work

165
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,198
this big huge parachute that we've got

166
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,479
it will only slow us down to about 200

167
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,520
miles an hour

168
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,280
and that's not slow enough to land so

169
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,719
we have no choice but we got to cut it

170
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,359
off

171
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
and then come down in rockets once we

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,160
turn those rocket motors on

173
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,360
if we don't do something we're just

174
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,319
going to smack right back into the

175
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,080
parachute

176
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,319
so the first thing we do is make this

177
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,680
really radical divert maneuver

178
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,880
we fly off to the side diverting away

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,800
from the parachute

180
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,240
killing our horizontal velocity and our

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,479
vertical velocity

182
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
getting the rover moving straight up and

183
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,000
down so it can look

184
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,359
at the surface with this radar and see

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
where we're going to land

186
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,919
and we head straight down to the bottom

187
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,479
of a crater

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,479
right beside a six kilometer high

189
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,719
mountain

190
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,080
we can't get those rocket engines too

191
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,400
close to the ground because if we were

192
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,599
to descend compulsively with our engines

193
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,359
all the way to the ground we would

194
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,960
essentially create this massive dust

195
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,000
cloud that dust cloud could then go and

196
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,440
land on the rover

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,280
it could damage mechanisms and it could

198
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,000
damage instruments so the way we solve

199
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,719
that problem

200
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,680
is by using the sky cream 20 meters

201
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,800
above the surface

202
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,520
we have to lower the rover below us on a

203
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,880
tether

204
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,639
that's 21 feet long and then gently

205
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,639
deposit it

206
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,800
on its wheels on the surface

207
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,039
as the rover touches down and is now on

208
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,280
the ground the descent stage

209
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,599
it's in a collision force with a rover

210
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,799
we must cut the bridle immediately

211
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:45,840
and fly the descent stage away to a safe

212
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:45,840
distance from the road

213
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,479
okay you can go to the next slide

214
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
well that was really exciting and

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,360
although it looks like science fiction

216
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,520
that is science fact we designed that

217
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,440
system that successfully landed the mars

218
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,520
science laboratory curiosity rover on

219
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
the surface of mars and that same entry

220
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,560
system design will be used to land the

221
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,240
mars 2020

222
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,319
perseverance rover on the surface of

223
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,240
mars but to go back to the ultimate

224
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,840
question is why are we so interested in

225
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,599
exploring mars and ultimately

226
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,679
the reason why space agencies around the

227
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,400
world explore other planets and other

228
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,919
asteroids

229
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,840
and other comets and other places in the

230
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,758
universe is to understand

231
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,758
our place in the universe and a great

232
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,000
example of that is really close to home

233
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,199
in this image you can see our home

234
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,879
planet earth in the middle

235
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,479
you can see venus off to the left and

236
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
mars off to the right what's so

237
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,159
interesting is that when the solar

238
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
system first formed these planets were

239
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,279
very similar to each other in terms of

240
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
having water on the surface

241
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,120
and appreciable atmosphere but over the

242
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,599
course of the past multiple billions of

243
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,959
years

244
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
the planets have evolved quite

245
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,560
differently earth of course is our home

246
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,160
it's beautiful and wonderful and has

247
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,839
water and air that we can breathe but

248
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,760
mars has a very thin atmosphere

249
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,959
a very cold temperature and venus has a

250
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,480
very hot

251
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,079
temperature and very high surface

252
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,000
pressure so what we can see

253
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,839
is that climate change is a planetary

254
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,240
phenomena we can see that with our own

255
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,399
neighboring planets mars and venus so we

256
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,480
can go to the next slide

257
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,320
so why are we so interested specifically

258
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
in mars well there's two reasons

259
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
one is the planet is somewhat

260
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,600
fascinating it has

261
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,599
interesting evidence of prior geologic

262
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,200
activity for example it's olympus mons

263
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,160
and the image in the upper left

264
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,160
is an extinct volcano about six times as

265
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,959
high as mount everest of dallas

266
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,120
marineris

267
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,279
which is the image on the bottom is sort

268
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,480
of the mars version of the grand canyon

269
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,880
but once again also

270
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,880
significantly higher and we can see that

271
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,480
the volcanic activity has shifted and

272
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,160
changed over the course of time

273
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
and that might be responsible for the

274
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,800
reason why the planet changed in terms

275
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,800
of its atmosphere

276
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,399
and water flowing on the surface and one

277
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,240
of the theories associated with that is

278
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,240
that there was a large celestial body

279
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
which impacted which then

280
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
disrupted the magnetic field and ripped

281
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
away the atmosphere and the reasons why

282
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
we send spacecraft there is to take

283
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,200
scientific measurements to understand

284
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,600
how the planet has evolved the way it

285
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,760
has the second reason of course though

286
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,800
is for future human exploration to the

287
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,640
surface of the planet

288
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,479
and when we develop technologies for

289
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,519
robotic exploration and when we collect

290
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,600
scientific data

291
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,000
about the planet using robotic

292
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,760
exploration we set the stage for future

293
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,399
human exploration so those are the two

294
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,640
reasons

295
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
why we explore mars we can go to the

296
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,800
next slide

297
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
so one of the things that's really

298
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,359
important for human beings and for life

299
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,279
in general

300
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,200
is the presence of water so that we can

301
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,200
use it to be able to survive and so that

302
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
life could have ever existed in the past

303
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,519
and what we've discovered with robotic

304
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,160
exploration over the past 20 years of

305
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,320
mars

306
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,519
is that there is actually flowing water

307
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,440
on mars it's not

308
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,959
big heavy water flows it's more like a

309
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
wet mud which you can see in these

310
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,439
images here

311
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,959
so you can imagine the first human

312
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
explorers when they go to the planet

313
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,079
would like to tap

314
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,599
into these potential sources of

315
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,640
subsurface aquifers

316
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,360
to be able to grow food and plants and

317
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,959
drink water

318
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,640
themselves and potentially produce

319
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,199
oxygen using that material

320
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,120
and all of this data exists because of

321
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,120
the robotic exploration of space

322
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
which is facilitated by agencies such as

323
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,120
nasa esa

324
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,399
jaxa and israel we can go to the next

325
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,399
slide now

326
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,839
and so one of the really important parts

327
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,839
of space exploration

328
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,680
is the development of new technologies

329
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,240
to facilitate our understanding and our

330
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,079
ability

331
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,000
to get there and to move around and have

332
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,560
mobility solutions on the surface of the

333
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,279
planet

334
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,119
so since the 1970s we have been sending

335
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,120
rovers to the surface of ours we've done

336
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,800
a total of our rovers and landers we've

337
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,240
done it a total of eight times now

338
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,560
and what you can see in this image is

339
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,760
that each time we send another vehicle

340
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,760
to the surface of mars

341
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,160
we increase its size we increase its

342
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,319
complexity so by learning on the past

343
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,880
we build the future and we evolve our

344
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,480
technology to be able to do more science

345
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
and eventually send people to the

346
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
surface of the planet and so the picture

347
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,079
of the rover you can see on the right

348
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,279
is the mars science laboratory curiosity

349
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,359
rover which is essentially

350
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,600
the same rover in terms of size and

351
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
capability as the perseverance rover

352
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,680
perseverance has a slightly different

353
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
mission

354
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,680
and a slightly different set of

355
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,000
instruments which i will discuss next

356
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,239
so we can go to the next slide so the

357
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,680
purpose of the perseverance mission

358
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,440
is to essentially conduct astrobiology

359
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
research to determine whether or not

360
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,959
mars once supported life

361
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
whether or not it was habitable and it

362
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,959
does that through a series of

363
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
instruments

364
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,119
specifically looking for something

365
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,440
called a biosignature and a biosignature

366
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,720
is sort of a chemical fossil which tells

367
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
you whether or not life

368
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,399
could have potentially existed on the

369
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,240
surface in the form of molecular

370
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,519
compounds or in the form of certain

371
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,959
types of isotopes

372
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,800
so when you think about the rover

373
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,439
perseverance which is on its way to mars

374
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,959
right now

375
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,480
you can think of it as a robotic

376
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,680
geologist carrying a suite of

377
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
instruments on its back

378
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,839
to make these types of measurements the

379
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,480
secondary purpose for the perseverance

380
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,440
mission

381
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,200
is to enable future human exploration

382
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,519
and it does that by

383
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,240
in one way actually demonstrating

384
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,880
something called

385
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,560
in-situ resource utilization which

386
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
allows you to take martian carbon

387
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,279
dioxide

388
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
and convert it into oxygen so showing

389
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,519
that you can essentially

390
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,239
live off of the land by using what is

391
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,440
around

392
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,120
if you're smart about it which is what

393
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
you would have to do when we go to mars

394
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,560
and of course the most fascinating

395
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,479
feature of the perseverance mission is

396
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,800
that it's going to collect a sample

397
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,560
it's going to cache a sample store it on

398
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,639
the surface of mars so that a future

399
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,839
mission calls mars sample return will

400
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,600
collect that sample

401
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,040
send it back to earth and with

402
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,279
earth-based laboratories

403
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,399
understand even better the potential for

404
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,800
life to have existed

405
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,160
on the surface of the planet so we can

406
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,959
go to the next slide now

407
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
so where is the perseverance rover going

408
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,638
it's going to a location called

409
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,560
jezreel crater and the reason why nasa

410
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,200
and the science community chose jezreel

411
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,518
crater

412
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
is because this area was once flooded

413
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,720
with water

414
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,240
many billions of years ago in an ancient

415
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,560
river delta

416
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,160
and when you look to environments which

417
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,160
are wet on earth you obviously find

418
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,000
evidence of lots of life so if you go to

419
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,959
an environment which was once wet on the

420
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,800
surface of mars

421
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,319
you could potentially find evidence of

422
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,160
prior life that existed

423
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,920
on the surface and the hope of course is

424
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,880
that we can find evidence of prior

425
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,880
microbial

426
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,399
life on the surface of mars in the past

427
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,600
and perhaps you know even in the present

428
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,560
but that's something that we will have

429
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,560
to uncover

430
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,880
when we eventually send back that cash

431
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,719
sample to earth and conduct more

432
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,079
uh detailed scientific measurements with

433
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,519
earth-based laboratories

434
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,359
but the image on the left here is

435
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,279
showing you the different vehicles that

436
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,480
we have sent to the surface of mars over

437
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,760
the course the past 20

438
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,720
30 years and where the mars 2020

439
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,839
perseverance

440
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,720
rover is located in jezreel crater

441
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,800
in that river delta from the past so we

442
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,600
can go to the next slide

443
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,680
so this uh coming up here is a video of

444
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,800
the entry descent and landing process

445
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,040
you can start the video

446
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,199
now if you're able to so the real

447
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,880
challenge of landing something on mars

448
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,120
is that you have all of this energy all

449
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,839
of the speed you're coming in at a speed

450
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,480
of 20 000 kilometers per hour which is

451
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,800
basically

452
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,800
30 times faster than a commercial

453
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,399
airplane so over a period of seven

454
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
minutes you have to slow that vehicle

455
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,360
down

456
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,560
to land the payload or the rover or

457
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,240
eventually people

458
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,359
safely on the surface of the planet and

459
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,880
you do that with a series of

460
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,600
technologies one of them is called the

461
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,360
heat shield

462
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,279
which takes you to about two times the

463
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,519
speed of sound then you deploy a very

464
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,639
large parachute which takes you to

465
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,560
around 300 kilometers per hour

466
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,399
and then finally you descend to the

467
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,479
surface on a series of

468
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,839
rocket motors or engines which help you

469
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
slow further down

470
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,120
to touch down softly on the surface of

471
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,680
the planet

472
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,759
so this sequence that you see here was

473
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,399
successfully completed by the curiosity

474
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,720
rover

475
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,560
back in 2012 and it's the same sequence

476
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,320
that the mars perseverance rover will

477
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,479
use in just a few months time

478
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,800
very complicated very difficult because

479
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,440
the rover has to execute this maneuver

480
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,079
autonomously by itself with no help from

481
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,920
the ground

482
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,199
because it's impossible due to the time

483
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,719
delay

484
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,040
of the speed of light and so that is the

485
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,720
landing sequence that mars perseverance

486
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,279
we'll use in just a few months time with

487
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,519
a few

488
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,360
updated editions so we can go to the

489
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,000
next slide and cut past this video if

490
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
you're able to

491
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,000
so what i'd like to talk about next is a

492
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,239
little bit about the science

493
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,279
of the mars perseverance mission so as i

494
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,279
mentioned before

495
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,880
the rover is essentially a robotic

496
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,720
geologist which means that

497
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,040
it carries a series of instruments on

498
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
its back and so by using a series of

499
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,880
spectrometers

500
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,480
as well as cameras as well as ways to

501
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,079
determine what is in the composition of

502
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,680
the atmosphere of the soil

503
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,279
uh the rover is able to make these

504
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,638
scientific measurements and

505
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,800
one of the most important instruments

506
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,440
which is on board the perseverance rover

507
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,040
is the moxie instrument which basically

508
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,839
allows the rover to create

509
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,680
oxygen from martian co2 this is a key

510
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,000
technology which will be needed

511
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,719
for future human explorers so that they

512
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
can survive

513
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,160
safely on the surface of mars so mars

514
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
not only has a low temperature

515
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,560
and a low pressure its oxygen atmosphere

516
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,000
is primarily carbon dioxide which means

517
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,638
that the crew would have to be able to

518
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,519
convert

519
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,040
co2 into oxygen to be able to survive on

520
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,040
the surface of the planet

521
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,480
so by taking a look at the geology by

522
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,319
taking a look at the atmosphere

523
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,160
by taking a look at the weather more

524
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,240
information can be determined about

525
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,000
where we've landed as well as about how

526
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,839
interesting the samples are that we are

527
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,880
going to be caching with this rover

528
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,639
so we can go to the next slide

529
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
so the way the rovers are named is

530
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,839
actually with a naming competition

531
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,760
before each mission and so the winner

532
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,639
here was perseverance which follows a

533
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,400
curiosity

534
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,160
you can see the size of this rover it's

535
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,760
about the size of a small car

536
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,400
it has about the weight or the mass of a

537
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,000
small car it has a series of six wheels

538
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080
which allow it to climb over

539
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,200
very large surface features and safely

540
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,280
without tipping over

541
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,880
without getting damaged of course the

542
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
gravity on mars is less than what you

543
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
would have here on earth but it's still

544
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
very challenging to be able to climb

545
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
around

546
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,360
it does this quite slowly because it

547
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
doesn't need to do it quickly as it's

548
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,000
collecting scientific measurements along

549
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,840
the way

550
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,440
and it also has a very unique power

551
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,840
source called an rtg

552
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,520
a radioisotope thermoelectric generator

553
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,678
which means that it doesn't have to rely

554
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,760
on solar radiation to generate power

555
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,440
itself generates its own power which

556
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,160
allows it to keep itself warm and

557
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,679
operate

558
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,840
more hours of the day than you could do

559
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,520
on solar power or roam another

560
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,520
unique advanced technology which was

561
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,799
demonstrated by curiosity and is being

562
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,280
demonstrated again

563
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
by the perseverance mission so we can go

564
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,399
to the next slide

565
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,160
um one of the new features of this

566
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,440
mission which i think is very exciting

567
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,080
because i am an electric

568
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,720
aviation entrepreneur is that the rover

569
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,720
is carrying a mars helicopter which is a

570
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,120
single rotor counter rotating

571
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,960
system which will allow it to do aerial

572
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,479
reconnaissance in the vicinity of the

573
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,039
rover once per day

574
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,320
this tiny little helicopter is powered

575
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,640
off of a battery

576
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,039
and solar panels to recharge its battery

577
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,400
it's capable of a 90 second flight

578
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,240
and it's able to go into the sky collect

579
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,840
images which allows the rover to better

580
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,760
understand its surroundings

581
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,760
it's incredibly lightweight only two

582
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,919
kilograms and this is necessary

583
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,679
because the atmosphere on mars is very

584
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,200
thin which means it can only generate a

585
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,480
very little bit of lift so it has to be

586
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
very lightweight

587
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,120
to counteract the fact that the

588
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,918
atmosphere is quite thin this is the

589
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,000
first time

590
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,360
an electric aircraft is ever being flown

591
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
on the surface another planet

592
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
and i think this is very exciting and

593
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
it's an important technology

594
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
demonstration

595
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,120
asset that could be used on future

596
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,320
missions to other planets that also have

597
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,280
atmospheres

598
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,840
and it is called ingenuity athlete so we

599
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,399
can go to the next slide now

600
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,320
so the countdown to mars so where are we

601
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,960
today will the rover successfully

602
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,439
launched

603
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,039
at the end of july um now it's on its

604
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,760
way to the red planet

605
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,960
it's targeted to land on february 18

606
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,039
2021

607
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,720
where we'll execute its entry descent

608
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,080
and landing sequence that i showed you

609
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,840
in that video before

610
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,600
after it safely lands a few minutes

611
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,639
later it will check out its systems and

612
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,959
then it will begin

613
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,799
its surface mission its surface journey

614
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
to collect the scientific measurements

615
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,879
for a minimum of two earth years which

616
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,200
is um

617
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,880
uh the minimum set of data that it will

618
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,400
collect it'll likely

619
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,080
rove around the surface for many many

620
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,880
years after that

621
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,080
so we can go to the next slide so what

622
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,559
is the future

623
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,799
of mars exploration we can now go to the

624
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,520
next slide so the future

625
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,440
of mars exploration is to set up for

626
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,960
human exploration of mars and so there

627
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,000
are many technologies that have to be

628
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,000
developed for

629
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
a colony no matter how small to

630
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,679
successfully survive on the surface

631
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,600
and a lot of that is surrounded by the

632
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,360
principles of in-situ resource

633
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,918
utilization which is living off of the

634
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,439
land

635
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,720
which is being sustainable which is

636
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
something that we need to do here on

637
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
earth first successfully to combat

638
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,960
climate change

639
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,200
and we can leverage all of those lessons

640
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,880
learned into our human beings would live

641
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,120
on the surface of another world so when

642
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,200
we talk about sustainability

643
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,559
for surface missions on extraterrestrial

644
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,919
locations we're talking about power

645
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,080
generation from the sun

646
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,480
we're talking about radiation protection

647
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,918
using the martian environment and soil

648
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,159
to mitigate some of those high energy

649
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,240
particles the production of water by

650
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,640
tapping into those subsurface aquifers

651
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,360
and then the creation of rocket fuel and

652
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,600
then also

653
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,799
plants called extremophiles using

654
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,760
martian co2

655
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,600
to grow those plants so um to wrap

656
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,919
things up we can go to the next slide

657
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,240
which is when are we going to see the

658
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,320
first human beings on mars

659
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,679
um you can go to the next slide if

660
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,240
you're able to um

661
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,880
probably within the next 15 to 20 years

662
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
is my guess

663
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,080
it is going to require international

664
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
collaboration and a lot of funding but i

665
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,120
do think that we'll get there

666
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,799
but this is an image of probably what

667
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,799
the first colony would look like

668
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,400
and then the final very final slide you

669
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,918
can go to the last slide

670
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,440
the question that i'll leave you with as

671
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,799
an audience is that would you want to

672
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,559
live on mars would you want your

673
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
children to live on mars do you see us

674
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,240
as the society actually living on the

675
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,600
surface of mars so thank you very much

676
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,679
and now we'll do a short q a

677
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,360
thank you very much anita this has been

678
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,440
absolutely fascinating and

679
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,639
not just for me i'm sure also for for

680
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,960
our audience

681
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,840
and i want to pick up where you actually

682
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,960
left

683
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,158
and um you talk about humans uh

684
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,159
to mars in about 15 or 20 years so

685
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,000
there is talk about the human mission to

686
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,480
the moon do you think that another

687
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,360
moon landed mission is needed before we

688
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,559
uh get

689
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,479
the humans on mars so there's two

690
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,240
different aspects to space exploration

691
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,919
when human beings are involved one is

692
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,840
the development of the technologies to

693
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,559
be able to accomplish it and the other

694
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,039
is the ability to be able to survive off

695
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,639
earth

696
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,799
in these sort of sustainable ways for a

697
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,080
long period of time so because the moon

698
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,360
doesn't have an atmosphere

699
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,280
a lot of the technologies that are

700
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,799
developed for a moon landing are quite

701
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,799
different than the technologies that are

702
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,320
developed for a mars landing so for

703
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,679
example you can't use a parachute on a

704
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,280
moon because there's no atmosphere

705
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
you pretty much would just use retro

706
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,960
rockets but that being said

707
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,799
the idea of being able to live

708
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,080
sustainably to be able to live for an

709
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,440
extended period of time in a higher

710
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,840
radiation environment is something that

711
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,960
we'll learn a lot about with a future

712
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,959
human mission to the moon

713
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,640
fantastic i do want to have a short

714
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,520
disclaimer saying that you were actually

715
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,240
a

716
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,559
responsible for the supersonic parachute

717
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,880
that

718
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,320
helped curiosity land on mars and it's

719
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,320
important for everyone to know

720
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,678
that that you are the mastermind behind

721
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,760
the technology of

722
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,600
slowing down from over 28 000 kilometers

723
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,760
an hour to zero to put

724
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,520
defender over successfully on on the red

725
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,559
planet so

726
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,360
you mentioned that in 15 uh 20 years uh

727
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,240
we will be

728
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,799
uh able maybe to to go there but

729
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,000
meanwhile the mars 2020 mission is on

730
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,639
its way with a planned date

731
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,880
of 21 for landing and european space

732
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,240
agency is also planning to send a rover

733
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,320
in 2022 so how can space agencies can

734
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,600
better pull resources together

735
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,080
to make this even more cheaper or even

736
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,240
more effective

737
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,559
well so first i will say it's absolutely

738
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,919
essential to support human exploration

739
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,520
for space agencies to pool their

740
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,240
resources because when you look at the

741
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,080
cost

742
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,360
associated with robotic missions when

743
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,720
you look at the cost associated with

744
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,000
human missions you're looking at an

745
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,320
order of magnitude

746
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
if not two orders of magnitude more cost

747
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,678
so it's simply impossible

748
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,279
for one country to be able to do this

749
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,720
alone you have to do it with space

750
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,080
agencies from around the world so

751
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,360
there's several ways to do that you

752
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,120
could choose to

753
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,479
break it up into a pie where one country

754
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,320
takes responsibility for the launch

755
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
vehicle another takes responsibility for

756
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,960
scientific instruments

757
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,799
another takes responsibility for the

758
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
spacecraft and that way you share the

759
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,520
costs or you can do it in a more

760
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,279
holistic fashion

761
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,720
where you look for who has the expertise

762
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,240
that we need and you form an

763
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,840
international team who works on

764
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,279
everything together and i definitely

765
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,959
would be a supporter of the latter

766
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,559
because i think that's super exciting as

767
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,440
an engineer to be able to work

768
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,440
with space agencies around the world

769
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,919
we'll make sure that at least this part

770
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,400
of our conversation will be sent to

771
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,440
multiple space agencies around the world

772
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,360
uh but still the the issue of space

773
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,799
exploration is not only a matter of

774
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,279
international cooperation

775
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,039
but also of uh space race and that's

776
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,760
where geopolitical tensions come

777
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,400
into place so what are your thoughts

778
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,720
about

779
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,520
about uh this issue is this the mars

780
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,279
exploration

781
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,840
will will it lead to more international

782
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,000
cooperation or to more geopolitical

783
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,760
pensions

784
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
i think there's another aspect of it

785
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,440
which is it leads to competition

786
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,439
and competition can actually lead to

787
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,440
efficiencies new technologies

788
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,960
innovation which ultimately facilitate

789
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,559
the exploration of space and a great

790
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,039
example of that which is completely in

791
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,120
line

792
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,720
with our discussion is the commercial

793
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,279
crew program that nasa

794
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
engaged in which now is sending

795
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,960
astronauts to this international space

796
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,880
station so the commercial crew program

797
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,400
came in at a very low development cost

798
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,520
only a few billion dollars

799
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,039
yet it gives us access to the

800
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
international space station which will

801
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,200
save

802
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,559
the us space agency money it will

803
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,679
facilitate space

804
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,639
tourism so i would see this aspect of

805
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,159
competition

806
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
amongst countries amongst private

807
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,240
companies is actually uh reducing costs

808
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,320
and finding new efficiencies in new

809
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
innovation

810
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,439
and talking about this competition we

811
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
have a question from audit from the

812
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,159
audience from katarina

813
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,959
asking if you could compare the goals

814
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,279
and technological level of the american

815
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,960
uae and chinese mars missions and their

816
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,440
significance for the future of space

817
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,200
exploration

818
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,120
well i'll be honest to say that i don't

819
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,640
know enough about the details of their

820
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,918
mission from an engineering perspective

821
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,440
to be able to compare it

822
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,720
but i would say that because they're

823
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,400
scientific missions and they have

824
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,760
scientific objectives they're probably

825
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,760
following the same objectives which is

826
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,039
to understand past habitability

827
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,480
whether or not there could have been

828
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,760
microbial life on the surface whether

829
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,880
there is still is today

830
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,158
and to be able to do um those types of

831
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,039
measurements you have to develop

832
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,559
instruments you have to have

833
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,000
telecommunications ability you have to

834
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,799
have power on board you have to have a

835
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,559
spacecraft bus

836
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,080
that can do those things so i think it's

837
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,918
great that we're creating

838
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,960
different uh sources of this expertise

839
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,640
across the globe because that

840
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,159
immediately feeds forward into this

841
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,120
vision of a

842
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,559
global or planetary earth human

843
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,279
exploration program that i hope happens

844
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,039
in the next

845
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:49,200
15 to 20 years you mentioned climate

846
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,480
change and sustainability and the idea

847
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,400
of protection of

848
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,960
of the outer space in your presentation

849
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,559
so uh this is a very important the

850
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,279
planetary protection is an important

851
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,320
aspect of

852
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,400
of sending spacecraft to mars so will it

853
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,200
be maintained once the humans the first

854
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,799
humans

855
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,400
will will get there so that's a really

856
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,080
good and important debate that we need

857
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,880
to have so just as a little bit of

858
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,000
background

859
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,919
when we send a spacecraft to a planetary

860
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,720
body a celestial body which may have

861
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,640
life we

862
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,159
use planetary protection protocols to

863
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,039
make sure that we don't bring earth

864
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,520
bacteria

865
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,120
or earth viruses to this planetary body

866
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,679
and therefore damage whatever might be

867
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,600
there

868
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,120
in terms of you know microbial life or

869
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,559
even contaminate our own scientific

870
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,760
measurements so when we send rovers to

871
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,678
the surface of mars

872
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,279
we engage in a variety of protocols

873
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,880
which make sure the rover's clean so

874
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,919
that we don't bring our earth-based

875
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
bacteria

876
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,120
to the surface of mars of course when we

877
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,559
send people it's going to be a very

878
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,479
different situation because people

879
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,918
inherently have a microbiome inside them

880
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,159
and they have bacteria that we use to

881
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,159
survive so we will be bringing bacteria

882
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
from earth tomorrow so we need to have a

883
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,520
global conversation

884
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,039
we need to have a policy discussion as

885
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,639
to how much is okay

886
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,840
what are we going to do in terms of to

887
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,799
reduce our footprint where we're

888
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,639
actually creating

889
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,320
um you know this human microbiome

890
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,360
environment these are conversations that

891
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,200
have to be had

892
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,439
at that geopolitical level which involve

893
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,399
scientists and engineers as well as

894
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,840
politicians

895
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,879
to say what is the right way to handle

896
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,918
this but it's something that we're going

897
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,480
to have to broach very soon

898
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,240
dr sigupta this has been really really

899
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,399
fascinating and a great pleasure

900
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,600
to have you with us today i would like

901
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,678
to thank you very much

902
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,320
for for joining the digital stage of

903
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,080
globsec and as i wrap up this panel

904
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,240
i would like to invite you all to stay

globstic 2020 digital stage and that's

907
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,039
an update
