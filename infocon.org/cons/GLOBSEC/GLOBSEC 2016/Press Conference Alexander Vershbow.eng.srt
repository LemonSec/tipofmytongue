essential contribution to shaping the

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,519
European a transatlantic agenda and this

11
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,229
year it's as important as ever both is a

12
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:58,780
key platform to discuss NATO's

13
00:00:56,229 --> 00:01:02,170
priorities ahead of our summit in Warsaw

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,330
July and second because we are dealing

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,210
with one of the most challenging

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:11,440
security situations in Europe in 90

17
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:13,690
decades the challenges come from both

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,940
the east and the south and NATO is

19
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,610
trying to take decisive action in

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,340
response to the challenges from both

21
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,070
directions since the whale summit in

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,539
2014 we've been implementing the

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,490
greatest strengthening of our collective

24
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:29,439
defense since the end of the Cold War

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,420
we've tripled the size of the NATO

26
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,439
Response Force with our new high

27
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,990
readiness spearhead force at its core

28
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,250
we've set up a chain of new headquarters

29
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,919
in the eastern part of our lives

30
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,320
including one here in Slovakia boosting

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,340
our ability to plan exercise and

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,520
reinforce if needed and we're reversing

33
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,890
the long decline in defense spending

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,609
with a halt in the cuts in most allied

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:02,439
countries last year and many countries

36
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:04,390
now increasing defense spending in July

37
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,369
at the summit meeting in Warsaw we will

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,869
take the next steps to further

39
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:10,699
strengthen our defensive deterrence

40
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,620
will enhance the forward presence of

41
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,298
multinational forces in the eastern part

42
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,879
of the Alliance will increase our

43
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:20,599
resilience against hybrid warfare and

44
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,790
cyber threats will advance the goal of a

45
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:26,899
year pole and free with the admission of

46
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,879
Montenegro as a member and will

47
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,370
reconfirm our long-term commitment to

48
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,440
Afghanistan through our resolute support

49
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,970
mission and through continued financial

50
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,560
support to the Afghan security forces

51
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,720
and we will agree on further measures to

52
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,819
respond to the challenges coming from

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,920
the Middle East and North Africa in

54
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,970
particular strengthening our ability to

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,410
train advise and assist local forces

56
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,409
we're already working closely with Iraq

57
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:58,040
Jordan and Tunisia to help them bolster

58
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:59,510
bolster their security but the

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,150
secretary-general and I think we could

60
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,599
do me he could be doing a lot more to

61
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:08,090
support countries on our southern flank

62
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:12,018
for instance Libya because in the end

63
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,970
the fight against terrorism is includes

64
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:17,000
building local capacity it's one of the

65
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,849
best weapons that we have so we have a

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,069
broad agenda which we put under the

67
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,470
rubric of long-term adaptation of the

68
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,450
Alliance to keep our alliance strong

69
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,489
open to dialogue and working with our

70
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,060
partners around the world so with that

71
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:37,780
ready to answer questions ok so it's

72
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,780
alice base for questions or there

73
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,909
it's a constant revenues from new Europe

74
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:47,810
newspaper and Brussels you mentioned I

75
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:50,060
love ya it's a caustic droplets from

76
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,549
Europe newspaper in Brussels you

77
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,810
mentioned the threat of the south and

78
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:59,810
also threat of fur in the Middle East

79
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,659
and northern Africa do you consider dash

80
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,569
dash to be the number one priority in

81
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:07,690
terms of number one threat now and also

82
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:11,750
how would you rank Russia it seems like

83
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,780
we heard from President Putin director

84
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,029
might talk that it was sort of fargo

85
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,370
center at all so he's brushed hair

86
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:22,119
another big threat for europe or is not

87
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,120
as much as touch

88
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,259
okay we'll turn up the microphone I

89
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,990
heard I heard question but it's very

90
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:40,979
hard to hear i'm like i have an airplane

91
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:43,449
behind me here i'm not sure where we're

92
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:46,029
setting a rank order of the threats

93
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:49,330
clearly dash is perhaps the most

94
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:52,449
pernicious of the terrorist groups that

95
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:55,210
are confronting first of all the Middle

96
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:58,419
East but now also our own societies but

97
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:02,739
okay al-qaeda is still out there other

98
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:09,609
groups like boko haram al-shabaab in

99
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:11,349
Somalia but ISIL or dash with its

100
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,409
aspiration to build a so-called

101
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:20,139
caliphate and establish the attributes

102
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:21,969
of a state is proving to be a more

103
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:25,029
formidable Challenger than maybe some of

104
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:26,919
the other groups and it requires a broad

105
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:31,120
international strategy which NATO is

106
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:34,180
only one player the coalition of course

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,849
that is fighting a diet especially in

108
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,919
Iraq and Syria is led by the United

109
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:40,688
States but all the Allies are

110
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,210
contributing in one way or another and

111
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:45,490
then there's other international efforts

112
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:49,659
to weaken the dash by cutting off its

113
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:52,659
financial support its oil business by

114
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:54,879
trying to control the movements of the

115
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:57,009
foreign fighters that go to the Middle

116
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,129
East and come back and create havoc in

117
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:02,710
our own societies there's the longterm

118
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:06,729
ideological battle to discredit it's

119
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,818
twisted version of Islam which first

120
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:13,810
which must be led by the the Muslim

121
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:16,870
world itself I think NATO's role is both

122
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,759
in ensuring that our forces in the

123
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,689
coalition are as interoperable as

124
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:25,360
possible that's our long-term role in

125
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:28,330
the past but in the future I am says

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,050
again trying to help shore up to build

127
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,628
up the capacity of

128
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,360
other middle eastern states threatened

129
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:37,970
by dash so that the spread can be better

130
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,280
contained through the efforts of the

131
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,400
international community and the

132
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,719
countries who are threatened themselves

133
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,770
as for your question about President

134
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,479
Putin obviously still very fundamental

135
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,930
problems in terms of Russian policy even

136
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:57,919
if the tone changes from one day to the

137
00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:00,379
next most fundamentally we still face

138
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,560
unacceptable Russian aggression against

139
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:06,199
Ukraine sovereign state which has seen

140
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,479
its a part of its territory illegally

141
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,120
annexed and its eastern provinces

142
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,669
destabilized through an insurgency yes

143
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,669
that's organized at paid for and

144
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:19,940
commanded from Moscow with Russian

145
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:23,448
troops directing the separatists in

146
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,650
eastern Ukraine so but we will talk to

147
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,080
Russia and we'll have a meeting next

148
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,989
week of the nato-russia Council in which

149
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,990
will give our assessment of Russia's

150
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,400
responsibility for the current situation

151
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,240
urge Russia to fully implement the Minsk

152
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,888
agreements but also discuss Russian

153
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,130
provocative military activities which

154
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:47,539
have created the risk of it of

155
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:51,289
accidental conflict and we think call

156
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:56,449
for returning to measures of Risk

157
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:58,969
Reduction and transparency which Russia

158
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:02,830
has been avoiding Christopher for some

159
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:02,830
time so it's a difficult relationship

160
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:08,629
Russia needs to change its behavior in

161
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:11,389
Ukraine but dialogue is part of the

162
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:13,800
effort to bring Russia back to policies

163
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:16,800
that we can

164
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
except

165
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:27,850
Young Buck Rogers can you hear me

166
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,849
despite the Jets buzzing behavior I'll

167
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,320
try to shout more I was going to ask

168
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,150
about the agenda important for the

169
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,330
nato-russia council meeting we just

170
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:41,449
talked about that but it's this meeting

171
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,099
actually sign of normalization rote

172
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,070
memorization improvement in relation

173
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:49,310
sources and efforts to operate in a kind

174
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:52,010
of unwanted escalation which we've seen

175
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:54,800
this program if actor by the russian

176
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,270
jets in the past week and so on so which

177
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,670
direction is it going is question number

178
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:01,460
one question of virtue relates to what

179
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:05,630
you talked about earlier during the

180
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,670
panel and that is the role of NATO in

181
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:11,630
North Africa and Middle East potentially

182
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:14,479
in the longer term just yesterday there

183
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:19,070
was news that the EU was ready to assist

184
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,280
the new Libyan government in training

185
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,860
and improving the security situation is

186
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,819
there any role for NATO when this is not

187
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,850
thank you the meeting of the nato-russia

188
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,870
Council start with that question the

189
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:37,130
meeting on Wednesday next week is is not

190
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,440
meant in any way to signal a

191
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:43,460
normalization of the relationship with

192
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,760
Russia when they illegally annexed

193
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:49,840
Crimea and and soon after that launched

194
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:55,010
the destabilization of eastern Ukraine

195
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,320
our leaders of this case it was our

196
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,960
foreign ministers agreed that we had to

197
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,850
suspend all practical cooperation with

198
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,950
Russia which have been taking place

199
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,200
under the umbrella of the nato-russia

200
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:09,950
Council and that remains our position

201
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,050
that at a time when Russia is violating

202
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,510
international law and many other

203
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:17,329
agreements basically violating the rules

204
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:19,970
of European security there can be no

205
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,860
business as usual but when we took that

206
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,370
decision we agreed that we should keep

207
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,500
channels of communication open and that

208
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,000
included the possibility of meetings of

209
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,270
the nato-russia Council at the level of

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,030
our passengers we had two such meetings

211
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,910
in the spring of

212
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:38,069
2014 that hasn't been used since that

213
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,699
time so this is more a resumption of

214
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:45,570
dialogue but not the normalization as I

215
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:48,150
said the agenda will be the crisis unit

216
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,260
around Ukraine including the need for

217
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,480
full implementation of the Minsk

218
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,540
agreements will talk about the military

219
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,060
activities that concern us the need for

220
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,790
transparency risk reduction I'm sure the

221
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:03,390
Russians will raise concerns about NATO

222
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,209
activities but we think we have a good

223
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,920
story to tell in that regard and lastly

224
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,180
we'll exchange assessments of the

225
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,459
situation in Afghanistan not that we

226
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,229
likely go back to cooperation but it's

227
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:20,850
obviously an area that affects both

228
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,030
NATO's and Russia's security and so that

229
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,740
will be the third topic on the other

230
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:30,240
question that the progress towards the

231
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,530
consolidation of this new government of

232
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:41,700
national unity in Libya is encouraging

233
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:44,250
and we stand ready to pop to assist that

234
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,740
government if it requests two years ago

235
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,670
we were very close to implementing a

236
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:55,790
program to assist the government at the

237
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:58,949
time in Libya in helping to develop and

238
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,709
reform its defence institutions and of

239
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,150
course Libya under Qadhafi had as

240
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,210
someone said at the conference today has

241
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:10,380
had no institutions so it's starting

242
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:14,370
from a very rudimentary base but if this

243
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:17,670
new government requests NATO assistance

244
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:21,300
in this same area we stand ready to help

245
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,579
them out indeed we have other potential

246
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:27,209
ways we could assist if they asked first

247
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,660
those would have to be decided by by all

248
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,529
28 allies

249
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,529
I'd be the cushion here

250
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:42,630
hello this is after remand from the

251
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,279
observer in Brussels it's about the NATO

252
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,649
mission in the Aegean Sea of

253
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,480
surveillance of my great dream close can

254
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:50,040
you give us an assessment on how

255
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
successful that's been in helping to

256
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,279
manage the situation also where the NATO

257
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,670
vessels have had to rescue any people

258
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,829
from the water and then going on whether

259
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,180
there is whether they'd have been

260
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:05,699
developed this role for example I

261
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,620
surveillance of migratory flows also in

262
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:12,510
North Africa would be buried him in the

263
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:17,910
Middle East the operation in the Aegean

264
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:20,610
which was decided in February based on

265
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:24,089
the proposal from Germany Greece and

266
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:29,610
Turkey has been underway now for several

267
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:32,579
weeks it's still not deployed fully in

268
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:35,459
all the areas that were envisaged but

269
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,219
already we can see some positive results

270
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:41,130
I don't know the latest statistics but

271
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,959
last week we heard an update indicating

272
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:47,519
that a significant number i think

273
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,729
between two and three dozen i don't know

274
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,350
the precise figure of smuggling illegal

275
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,970
smuggling vessels were first identified

276
00:13:52,350 --> 00:14:00,750
by the nato mission and enabled an

277
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:04,380
earlier alert to go to the responsible

278
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:07,230
authorities the Turkish and Greek Coast

279
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,560
Guard's as well as Frontex and at least

280
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,180
in some cases it would enable them to

281
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,000
intercept so that's how it's supposed to

282
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:20,279
work NATO is providing surveillance to

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,820
support the the responsible agencies but

284
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:28,140
they do the actual interdiction of the

285
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:30,209
illegal ships as far as I know data

286
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:35,670
hasn't hasn't been called upon to rescue

287
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:40,229
any any migrants who were at risk of

288
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:43,920
of sinking but that halo has that

289
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,630
authority as an international obligation

290
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,640
for all all vessels to help people in

291
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,590
distress as far as I know hasn't

292
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,980
happened yet could this be a broader

293
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:57,390
mission something allies would have to

294
00:14:52,980 --> 00:15:00,000
debate the european union of course is

295
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,250
conducting a an operation operation

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,850
Sofia in the central Mediterranean aimed

297
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:08,430
at controlling illegal smuggling from

298
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:10,740
North Africa and Libya in particular to

299
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:15,140
Europe at the moment the EU has not

300
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:19,170
sought to the same sort of NATO support

301
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,699
but if they were to do so I think the

302
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,810
experience gained in the Indian would

303
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,400
would help us in answering that call but

304
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:30,380
do you seem to think it seems to feel it

305
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,380
has it covered at least up till now

306
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,300
thank you very much my name is not wash

307
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,459
naveed i'm from solar public television

308
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,219
I have just one question this summer

309
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,620
NATO semi NATO summit will be held in

310
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,560
war so it will be near the Russian

311
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:50,250
border do you think or King you believed

312
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:54,239
it could stigmatize result of the summit

313
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:57,120
and in connection with this do your

314
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,930
thing what about polish expectations

315
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,560
about permanent presence of NATO in

316
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,560
Poland

317
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:11,439
like again what any nation that hosts a

318
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:15,610
NATO summit is proud to do so and it's

319
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:17,379
of course a moment for all the Allies to

320
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,589
come together in solidarity so I don't

321
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:24,910
see any danger of stigmatizing the

322
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:27,029
decisions or the of the event in fact

323
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,620
I'm optimistic that it will be a very

324
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,839
significant show of unity on the part of

325
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,709
the Alliance in terms of strengthening

326
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:39,120
our defensive deterrents supporting our

327
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:41,709
neighbors in the east and the south and

328
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,040
showing that the Alliance is able to

329
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:48,790
adapt to the significant challenges of

330
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,339
the time this issue of forward presence

331
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,800
will be high on the list of decisions

332
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:56,230
the details still have to be worked out

333
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,079
so I can't describe to you what it will

334
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,850
entail but we already know from the

335
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:04,599
decisions of our defense ministers in

336
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:07,449
February that this enhanced forward

337
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,458
presence needs to be multinational it

338
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:12,659
will be rotational as opposed to

339
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:16,209
permanent but it will be a continuous

340
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:20,740
rotational presence with real combat

341
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:24,209
capability aimed at demonstrating to any

342
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:27,399
aggressor that if they challenge the

343
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:31,179
borders of NATO they would encounter not

344
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:34,330
just home defense forces but Americans

345
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:35,440
and Europeans as well so in other words

346
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,279
they would be taking on the whole

347
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,309
Alliance so I think that the Allies

348
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,510
agree on these basic principles include

349
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,090
including that this would be a

350
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,669
rotational presence and I think we heard

351
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:55,720
from Minister vucic offski yesterday

352
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:59,420
that a rotational presence is supported

353
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:08,170
by Poland for for the Warsaw summit

354
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:11,210
special here thank you problem yesterday

355
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:14,060
Reuters an agency published article with

356
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,780
the headline al-qaeda re-emerged as a

357
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:21,800
challenge for us NATO in Afghanistan

358
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:24,740
after 15 years we went to Afghanistan we

359
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,620
have headlines like this how do you

360
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,630
assess the situation in Afghanistan is

361
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:34,270
every other is every night to presence

362
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:36,440
thank you well we believe the overall

363
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,970
trends in Afghanistan have been

364
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,280
favorable with the Afghan security

365
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,300
forces who now have the full

366
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,010
responsibility for the for the fight

367
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,700
steadily gaining capability improving

368
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:52,490
their leadership their ability to to

369
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,730
counter the Taliban and other other

370
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,110
threats that being said the Taliban has

371
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,860
proved to be very pernicious and there

372
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,780
are manifestations of other terrorist

373
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,139
groups but i think the taliban is still

374
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,389
the main adversary in afghanistan but

375
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:16,160
there's also branches perhaps self

376
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:19,220
branding themselves of a diet but a new

377
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,290
fighting season has begun NATO is

378
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,720
committed to continuing to advise and

379
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:27,500
assist and train the Afghan security

380
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,250
forces and to support the efforts of the

381
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,920
national unity government there to

382
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:39,730
improve the strategic direction of the

383
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:43,820
forces so we're still confident that

384
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:46,490
things are improving still a lot of

385
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,070
challenges ahead but i think the sense

386
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:52,130
that the afghanistan is worth the

387
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,720
further investment is reflected in the

388
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,370
fact that allies have already decided

389
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,820
that will extend the current resolute

390
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,840
support mission into 2017 and that we

391
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,950
will course stay engaged with

392
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,689
Afghanistan over the longer term

393
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,600
even after resolute support is completed

394
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,150
we'll move from a military-led training

395
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,469
mission to a civilian-led mission under

396
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,990
what's called the enduring partnership

397
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:16,480
for Afghanistan so whenever to turn our

398
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:21,100
backs on Afghanistan but the threats are

399
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,390
still there and Afghans have have tough

400
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,240
fight on their hands but they are

401
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:32,290
steadily improving if any other

402
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,360
questions if not thank you very much Bob

403
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,980
for paradox and we will see each other

404
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,879
in couple of minutes in next press

405
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,880
conference thank you
