00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,060
used to do it I check web by googled and

27
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:15,950
I put Albright quotes and there is

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,900
thousands of quotes one very famous

29
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,759
there is a special place in hell for

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,020
women do we who do not help each other

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,390
but one very simple thing catch my eye

32
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:30,140
caught my eye and that was the let me

33
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:33,259
look at that most of the time I spent

34
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,979
when I get up in the morning is to be

35
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:40,750
figure out what is going to happen very

36
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:43,880
simple thing we usually do it some of us

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,610
who tried to think what is going to

38
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,350
happen and I think this was a perfect

39
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,079
description of our intention here in

40
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,179
Globe sick to bring people to create a

41
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,990
blend of people who could come in one

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:00,350
place I'll try to wake up not in the

43
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:03,169
morning well I mean wake up in a

44
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:06,020
figurative sense and think where we are

45
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,390
where the world we are part of is today

46
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,000
he not only try to figure out what is

47
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,279
going to happen but what we should what

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,440
we could and what we are obliged to do

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,010
about it to make our

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:24,380
better more secure and more predictable

51
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:26,660
place every time when I open globe sake

52
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,450
i used to say security is not for free

53
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,090
we have to work on that we should not be

54
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,489
negligible and it's becoming a cliche

55
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,180
because I feel partly some frustration

56
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:41,120
that it seems like we are still running

57
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,170
uphill but we cannot see on the top of

58
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,840
the hill and world as globe sector globe

59
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,540
sec excuse me for being biased so I

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,490
measure that deer by ear glob sector

61
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,859
glob sick it's not becoming a better

62
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:58,640
place when we look when we look where we

63
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:04,220
are today from the last year well we

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:07,790
don't see any more better world in

65
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,700
Ukraine Crimea we don't see less

66
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,600
problems in the greater Middle East we

67
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:17,179
see terrorism stronger other than weaker

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,840
we see Europe completely out of balance

69
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,739
we see an individual countries of EU and

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,780
transatlantic space a kind of weakening

71
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,959
of our self-confidence that system we

72
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,550
are part of is truly the one which is

73
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,459
superior we see the growth of extremism

74
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:40,580
we see the growth of intolerance

75
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:43,010
xenophobia are you see in politics

76
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,200
strange people coming up and don't take

77
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,810
me wrong or those those of you who who

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,399
are out of political world so world has

79
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,209
not become better place but this is a

80
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,010
good reason to meet again are in this

81
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,810
excellent blend as we managed to have

82
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,230
again thank you all very much for coming

83
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:03,170
we have a excellent blend of political

84
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,630
leaders analysts are those who think

85
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,970
those who should do those who think and

86
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,410
do that's the best combination not

87
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:15,080
always so and i have a small few small

88
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,399
announcements to make unfortunately we

89
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,160
will have a small change in the program

90
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,909
we will have to skip the panel of two

91
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,039
prime ministers czech and slovak arm

92
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,910
which is very unfortunate our prime

93
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:30,030
minister is in the hospital

94
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,830
he's got a small heart issue we are all

95
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,590
very much hoping that it will get fine

96
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,620
I'll let me cheer the audience to wish

97
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,719
him well and n speed recovery but we

98
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,490
will need to skip the panel or prime

99
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,980
ministers and there will be small change

100
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,510
in the program you will benefit from it

101
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,670
by the way because you will then have a

102
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,320
small break between the evening things

103
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:54,500
