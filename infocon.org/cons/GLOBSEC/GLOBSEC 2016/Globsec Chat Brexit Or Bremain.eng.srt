00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,130
welcome your moderator of the globe sec

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:19,919
Chet Tom Nuttall good afternoon everyone

3
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,259
I'm Tom Nuttall I write about European

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,640
politics and economics for the Economist

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,970
we're here for what's going to be a

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,429
fairly brief session on brexit for those

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,198
watching from afar can seem like this

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,820
campaign has been going on for weeks or

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,180
months in fact it actually formally

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,250
started only yesterday we can now look

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,430
forward to 10 weeks of what will no

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,800
doubt be a highly civilized debate

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,899
grounded entirely in facts and utterly

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,809
free of distortions exaggerations and

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,640
posturing and with me to discuss this is

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,110
David Lidington who is the British

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:01:04,019
Europe Minister please give him a warm

18
00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:06,450
welcome thank you before I start I will

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,189
just quickly note that the minister has

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,070
been in post since the Conservative

21
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,839
Party took office in 2010 which makes

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,270
him the longest-serving Europe minister

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,130
since the post was created in the 1970s

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,960
and there's not a bad achievement when

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,339
you look at the under the Labour

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,960
government ministers barely had a chance

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,689
to get their feet under the desk before

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,100
they were whisked away for a replacement

29
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,380
we have only 30 minutes so we'll get

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,908
right into it I'm going to start with a

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,149
couple of questions then we'll turn it

32
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,770
over to the audience for QA and I

33
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,689
because we only have half an hour I'm

34
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,520
going to take a fanatical approach

35
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,679
towards time keeping both with the

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,979
minister and with you because our time

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,850
is so short minister if I can start by

38
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:51,479
asking the polls recently seemed to have

39
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,309
shown a decisive shift towards the leave

40
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,950
position it's now getting rather close

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,090
what in your view has gone wrong and

42
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,770
what is the government going to do to

43
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,829
turn this around I think it was always

44
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,479
likely that the the polls were going to

45
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:10,068
be closed as people focused on the issue

46
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:12,870
and we've seen I think since the

47
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:17,099
migration crisis broke

48
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,390
last summer a shift a greater number of

49
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,159
people moving towards leave it's still

50
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,089
the case that the majority of poles and

51
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,879
the bookmakers are all point to a remain

52
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,709
win but it's not something we can take

53
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,828
for granted in any way and I think that

54
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,019
the message that the Prime Minister is

55
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:37,140
very determined to keep pushing forward

56
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,730
is that it is to both economic and

57
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,609
security advantage of the United Kingdom

58
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,200
to remain an EU member and there are

59
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,160
profound risks about the kind of leap

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,040
into the dark that leaving would involve

61
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,599
you mentioned the migration crisis those

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,179
of us who have been watching it acutely

63
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,010
aware that it's very much not over yet

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,629
the next couple of months during which

65
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,179
the campaign will really gather speed in

66
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,879
Britain could see all sorts of

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,769
unexpected events there how worried are

68
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,929
you about the ways in which that could

69
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,349
feed into the debate over Britain's

70
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,819
position in the European no doubt I mean

71
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:15,450
immigration in its broadest sense has

72
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,130
been the top-ranked issue in terms of

73
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,380
British public opinion for well over a

74
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,418
year now ahead of the economy ahead of

75
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,180
the health service Veda the normal bread

76
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:27,660
and butter domestic issues now of course

77
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,419
the UK leaving the European Union is not

78
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,609
going to make one iota of difference to

79
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,280
what is happening in the eg and alter

80
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,900
the numbers of people in cali anything

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,049
it will make it worse because it will

82
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,959
make it more difficult for European

83
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:45,599
countries none of which can solve this

84
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,669
crisis on on its own to come together

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,168
with a cooperative ants and I think what

86
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,290
is really important as we look forward

87
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:53,400
to the next few months both of the

88
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,298
British question but leaving aside the

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,810
British question it's objectively

90
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:01,169
important is that the EU agreement with

91
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:04,859
turkey is made to work that it is

92
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:07,620
implemented properly and that we press

93
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,989
ahead with what we're doing to follow up

94
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,599
with a letter summit cartoon process

95
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,639
working with African countries to try to

96
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,159
bring some order to the situation the

97
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,139
central Mediterranean as well if if

98
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,690
Britain does vote to stay in the

99
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,700
European Union it will remain outside

100
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,190
perhaps the two most crucial important

101
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,750
areas of cooperation and integration

102
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,960
the first being the single currency and

103
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,790
the second being the asylum and border

104
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,739
area of cooperation on which Britain has

105
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,810
an opt-out now the government calls this

106
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,990
having the both the best of both worlds

107
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,780
but is there a sense that as the years

108
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,400
go by and the integration proceeds in

109
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,919
this in these areas in which Britain

110
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,200
stays outside that Britain mate might

111
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,450
anyway drift towards some sort of

112
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,070
associate membership of the EU can

113
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,960
Britain ever be truly happy inside the

114
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,880
European Union yes I think Britain can

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,289
be happy inside the your opinion on the

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,210
basis of a mutual respect on our part

117
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,880
for the fact that for some other

118
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,450
countries there is a genuine deep-felt

119
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,760
wish to pursue greater fiscal economic

120
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,289
and political integration and the single

121
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,270
currency undoubtedly creates a dynamic

122
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,120
that takes things in that direction

123
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,240
lines those countries at a part of it

124
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,310
but equally which respects the position

125
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,620
of member states like ourselves who do

126
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,350
not want to pursue that course and i

127
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,620
think that the historic importance of

128
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,290
the febri european council agreement was

129
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,290
that for the first time it committed the

130
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:40,410
european union every member state

131
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:43,620
publicly to the notion that there should

132
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,419
be more than one destination we're not

133
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,440
talking about two speeds we're talking

134
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:51,750
about a pattern of variable geometry

135
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,080
differentiated integration with some

136
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,820
countries choosy to pursue about closer

137
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,500
political integration and other others

138
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,320
not and each grained respect the other

139
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,710
position okay I will now turn it over to

140
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,000
the QA part of the session we can take

141
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,390
questions from the audience of course

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,160
but also via the globe SEC app and the

143
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,130
questions will pop up on my gadget here

144
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,450
you can just tap the post a question

145
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,400
segment of the app if you have anything

146
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,320
to anything that you would like to pose

147
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,030
to the minister and please let me remind

148
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,520
you to be extremely brief because we

149
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,650
only have about 20 minutes I don't want

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,930
to keep you from your lunch so who would

151
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,120
like to begin please sir in the front

152
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,430
and if you could wait for the mic which

153
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,100
I think should be on its way and please

154
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,900
remember to identify yourself thank you

155

160
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,679
simple question please David Cameron

161
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:57,690
quite strongly is supporting this thing

162
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:00,590
in European Union but many British

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,669
businesses representatives

164
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,659

underline that it is not needed that

167
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:15,840
some strong European vision of Great

168
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,690
Britain resent it not only to British

169
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,900
citizens but other 27 European countries

170
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:25,550
is needed what do you think about it

171
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:29,130
well the dogs clear is that all the main

172
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,900
business groups Confederation of British

173
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,979
industry engineering employers

174
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,239
federation British Chambers of Commerce

175
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:40,440
Federation of small businesses either

176
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,690
have a corporate position or reflect the

177
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,870
views of a majority of their member

178
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,180
companies in be decisively in favor of

179
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:52,280
continuing membership of the European

180
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:55,530
Union I think that the economic case for

181
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,650
membership is the one that cuts through

182
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,049
most to British voters that that's what

183
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,460
every single opinion poll tells us and

184
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,660
now the other arguments about security

185
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,700
about diplomatic weight are important

186
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,080
and we mustn't neglect those but it is

187
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,960
the economic arguments which the

188
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,969
evidence suggests matter most to the

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,120
people casting their vote and I think

190
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,710
we've got to have a combination of

191
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,099
arguments we've both got to emphasize

192
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,960
the positive advantages of EU membership

193
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,210
the fact that it has brought a flood of

194
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,710
foreign direct investment into the

195
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,789
United Kingdom is still the biggest

196
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:35,520
chair of any member state of the the EU

197
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:36,929
that it has simplified matters are so

198
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,520
many of our businesses that it has

199
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,400
brought benefits to consumers in the

200
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,300
forms of cheaper prices and key

201
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:50,339
opportunities like cheap air travel and

202
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:53,290
cheaper mobile and data charges so

203
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:56,380
that's important and we need to continue

204
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,209
to demonstrate that the EU is up for the

205
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,670
task of completing the single marketing

206
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:02,609
services for forging new trade deals and

207
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,699
cutting back on unnecessary red tape and

208
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:09,459
regulation but there's also is important

209
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:12,639
to keep saying to people that there is

210
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:16,660
no easy alternative you listen to their

211
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:19,269
Champions of brexit and you get confused

212
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,899
and contradictory answers as to what a

213
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:24,519
relationship with the EU outside

214
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,889
membership would amount to some say

215
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,839
Norway well that means you accept free

216
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:30,190
movement to accept paying into the

217
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:31,720
budget you accept all the rules and

218
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,449
regulations that you have no vote on

219
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,649
them some say a Canada star Free Trade

220
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,569
Agreement well that doesn't touch

221
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:41,310
services and it's taking a very long

222
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:44,589
time to negotiate and let alone a ratify

223
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,689
some say rely on the WTO will the WTO

224
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:48,730
rules large you don't apply to services

225
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,050
they still lead to some very significant

226
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,630
tariffs that would affect for example

227
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:56,290
our car exporters and quite a number of

228
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:58,449
our agricultural food exporters and they

229
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,149
don't normally touch services a at all

230
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:03,849
so all of the alternatives seemed to me

231
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:06,760
to be fraught with uncertainty and worse

232
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,589
than what we get at the moment we had a

233
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,589
question here in the front please sir at

234
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:15,279
Jonathan aisle Lucy London a minister I

235
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,500
want to take up Tom's initial remarks in

236
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,510
and sort of develop them further let me

237
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,490
take you to the 24th of June and let's

238
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,800
assume that the answer is yes for

239
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,839
staying in the European Union now apart

240
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,139
from applause when you go back to

241
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,720
Brussels what is the British policy I

242
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,839
mean do we just say woof we past that

243
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,589
hurdle sit down and contiguous before Oh

244
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:40,300
is there a reform agenda of the UK for

245
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,029
the European Union who could be taken

246
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,709
forward the day after oh very very

247
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,709
definitely the latter Jonathan because

248
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:54,040
look beyond the UK look at the

249
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:56,680
challenges facing Europe and the

250
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,259
disaffection in so many countries which

251
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,329
is giving rise to support for populist

252
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:04,779
parties of both right and left in many

253
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:07,270
member states there's a existential

254
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:09,010
economic challenge

255
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,110
thrown efforts by global competition and

256
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,850
digital technology if Europe can't raise

257
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,160
its game on competitiveness and create

258
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,020
more jobs then the next during the

259
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,969
generation won't have the standards of

260
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,680
living all the social protection people

261
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,270
expect now and if that happens the

262
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,939
social and political tensions will be

263
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:27,069
profound so really pushing forward and

264
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,930
leading the agenda on completing that

265
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,430
single market especially in services

266
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:34,989
where most of the new jobs will come

267
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:36,819
from it in trade deals in cutting

268
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,350
unnecessary regulation is key but then

269
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,930
there's a political dimension to this as

270
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,990
well we face challenges from global

271
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:47,650
crime and terrorism that will require

272
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,090
more work which our Home Secretary

273
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,610
Theresa May is helping to lead at

274
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,920
European level on things like rules on

275
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,530
cross-border firearms movements on

276
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,050
better information exchange between

277
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,579
police forces across Europe passenger

278
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:04,060
Dane records which I'm glad was approved

279
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,000
by the European Parliament this week but

280
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,430
also challenges from a truculent

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,310
aggressive Russia that we need to show

282
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,569
solidarity in resisting because that's a

283
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,040
threat to the security of so many

284
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,240
countries particularly in Central Europe

285
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,260
and the challenge of state collapse in

286
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,900
parts of Africa and the Middle East

287
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,810
which is one of the key drivers of

288
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,730
large-scale movements of people not the

289
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,160
only one but it's one key element of

290
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,830
that again we can't Germany can't France

291
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,930
can't sort this on its own working

292
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,300
together we stand a chance of doing so

293
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,489
it's even more important we do that at a

294
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,890
time when the political appetite in the

295
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,140
United States for such global

296
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,180
interventions is diminished compared

297
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,780
with what it once was you see that in

298
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:52,989
the way in which American voters you

299
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:56,890
know are resentful of what they see as

300
00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,130
Europe consuming security overwhelmingly

301
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,830
paid for by American taxpayers I'm going

302
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,660
to take a question from the app in front

303
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,550
of me and this is from Francis O'Donnell

304
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,910
from the institute of international and

305
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:13,060
european affairs the question is if as

306
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,810
polls indicate Northern Ireland Scotland

307
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,760
and Wales will vote to remain inside the

308
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,949
European Union if the overall if because

309
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,370
of the English vote Britain votes to

310
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,170
leave

311
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,650
well this essentially be an English vote

312
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:29,529
for independence as the the the polls

313
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:31,150
are sir tat the moment they're showing

314
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:33,490
Scotland and Northern Ireland very

315
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,410
decisively in favor of continued

316
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,990
membership London very decisively in

317
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,260
favor of continued membership and in

318
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,620
rest of England and in Wales too it's

319
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:47,410
more it's a more close battle I think

320
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,180
that while this has to be a decision for

321
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,560
the UK as a whole it's the UK that's the

322
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,140
member state of the signatory of the

323
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:58,209
treaties there there would certainly be

324
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,589
a very least some political and

325
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,180
constitutional turbulence because the

326
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,800
Scottish National Party the First

327
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,209
Minister of Scotland already said in the

328
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,880
event of a vote to leave they would

329
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,920
press for a second referendum on

330
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,320
Scottish independence I think Northern

331
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,589
Ireland the the risks are even more

332
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,830
troubling because this is the UK's only

333
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:20,350
land border and we've had a common

334
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,110
travel area with the Republic of Ireland

335
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:27,550
ever since the partition of Ireland in

336
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:30,970
the early 1920s and Irish is able to

337
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:34,120
move freely into the UK and vice versa

338
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:37,270
now if that becomes an EU external

339
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,240
border then there may be obligations on

340
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:44,800
Republic of Ireland to impose checks

341
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:48,670
there if as the champions of leaving the

342
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:56,109
EU argue the one purpose in leaving is

343
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:58,449
to stop EU movement into the UK well

344
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,850
then you can't do that without some sort

345
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:04,810
of border checks including at your sole

346
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:07,480
land frontier and actually try to impose

347
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:10,119
those would would be a massive practical

348
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,410
challenge but I think then i was picking

349
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,589
this up when i was in northern ireland

350
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:18,219
recently you know you you start just to

351
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:20,589
to make what is still an incomplete

352
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,750
peace process that little bit more

353
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,400
vulnerable I think there's no wish to

354
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,260
make it more vulnerable either north or

355
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,709
south of the border but I just think it

356
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,720
we would be crazy to undermine that

357
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,489
process of reconciliation in any way

358
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,320
which is of course why the Irish

359
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,640
government is very

360
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,070
to each other why the Irish government

361
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,770
is very keen to do and why I think

362
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,800
public opinion in Northern Ireland which

363
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,540
historic is not always being strong in

364
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,189
support of EU membership at the moment

365
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,319
seems to be quite decisively in favor of

366
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,930
romaine we had a question over here

367
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,440
please sir slava me Deb ski polish

368
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:58,020
Institute of International Affairs also

369
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,000
Debbie my question is following but yeah

370
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,860
in Poland we are keeping our fingers

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,770
crossed for this part of the government

372
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,480
you represent who are in favor of

373
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:10,170
staying united kingdom within the

374
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,980
opinion Poland is is preparing itself

375
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:16,729
for hosting next NATO summit if

376
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:20,580
something goes wrong for this part of of

377
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,740
the government you represent what you

378
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,720
what great britain is going to say what

379
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,830
message is going to deliver during the

380
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:33,990
summit well i think there will be a

381
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:36,510
determination to continue with the the

382
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,430
commitment to NATO and to collect a

383
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:42,330
defence and security that the Prime

384
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,370
Minister has championed and he and the

385
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,290
Foreign Secretary have been very clear

386
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,850
in their bilateral conversations with

387
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:52,819
their pose opposite numbers that that is

388
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:56,630
their their commitment I just think that

389
00:16:52,820 --> 00:17:01,820
the moment we have a situation where

390
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:04,410
NATO rightly remains the the prime

391
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,089
organization for European collective

392
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,850
security and crucially for keeping the

393
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,859
Americans and the Canadians bound in at

394
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,169
a time when its Sun the other side of

395
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:18,389
Atlantic would like to see those those

396
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:21,180
links given less priority but the EU

397
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:24,030
plays an essential complementary role if

398
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,740
we're talking about Russia no Russia

399
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,820
presents not just a conventional

400
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:32,190
military challenge to to some parts of

401
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,750
Europe but there are challenges that

402
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,410
Europe faces in terms of the use of

403
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:40,230
energy as a weapon for diplomatic

404
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:43,320
influence it terms how information is

405
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:47,460
used terms of how cyber capability is

406
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,000
used and those are things that it is the

407
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,630
e

408
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,960
EU are not simply NATO needs to be

409
00:17:51,630 --> 00:18:00,480
equipped to respond to question here in

410
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:04,230
the front please yes thank you Phillip

411
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,470
blonde from Res Publica in London really

412
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:10,080
Mike my question is a combination of the

413
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,930
two earlier questions and I'm profoundly

414
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,520
for remaining in I want you to succeed i

415
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:18,510
want the prime minister saw your tweet

416
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,420
okay thank you very much but I fear

417
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,340
we're missing a trick I agree with you

418
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:26,310
that the economic argument is at the top

419
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,659
but what those who want to exit have

420
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:30,300
effectively have done if they've

421
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,490
neutralized the economic argument if I

422
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,720
was a campaign director for them I'd

423
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,640
have done exactly what they've done

424
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,950
they've confused the argument they've

425
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,950
divided business opinion and so

426
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,080
consequently in a way for the vote the

427
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,140
strongest hand we have to play has been

428
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:50,159
relatively neutralized what I fear that

429
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,870
that we should add to the the offer that

430
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,390
isn't in the offer and I think that both

431
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,479
questions from the floor ask is a strong

432
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:59,820
positive not a technocratic vision for

433
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,010
Britain's role if you look at the people

434
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,020
who are voting against Britain joining

435
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,360
they are nationalists in not in a

436
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,210
pejorative sense their patriotic they

437
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,979
believe in Britain's greatness the what

438
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,230
and they think Britain's greatness is

439
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,190
secured peculiarly in bizarrely by

440
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:20,280
somehow going off alone in a completely

441
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,410
almost kind of fantastical manner that

442
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,300
would somehow be Elizabethan kind of

443
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,300
pirates again or something vaguely

444
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,800
ridiculous the point is is there's an

445
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,610
argument I think you need to make that

446
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,290
you're not making and that is that the

447
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:37,350
Europe is the platform in the path to

448
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,540
Britain's continuing world influence on

449
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,730
the global stage that Europe is the

450
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,920
multiplier platform in Europe is the

451
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,470
path to Britain's greatness not the

452
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:50,160
impediment to it can I ask you feel yeah

453
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,600
why is this argument not being made well

454
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,770
i was i was making it at some length

455
00:19:51,600 --> 00:20:00,929
that gin a speech I gave two days ago to

456
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:02,340
a sponsor conference in in London and I

457
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,810
I will certainly be doing doing more

458
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,310
than I think you will hear more of that

459
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:10,470
as the campaign proper gets underway but

460
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,600
I won't disagree with you Phillip is in

461
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,370
saying that you know business opinion

462
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,560
has been being divided economic

463
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,909
arguments being be neutralized I agree

464
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:23,090
with your analysis of the tactics or the

465
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:26,940
other side but the overwhelming view of

466
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:29,070
business continues to be for remain a

467
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,880
city for example come out very publicly

468
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:35,250
as a corporate body to champion remain

469
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,410
what you do have of course it is true is

470
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,530
that the BBC with the duty of

471
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:43,110
impartiality is sort of balancing

472
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,300
comments in a well the Lord Mayor of

473
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,280
London no says this on behalf of the

474
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,200
city and then we find a hedge fund

475
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,510
manager somewhere who has a different

476
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,400
view and so that that is balanced but

477
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:58,170
actually it's not a representative

478
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,050
balance and we're opinion lies and I

479
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,560
think my one warning I don't disagree

480
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:07,530
with the the key point you are making

481
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:11,250
but i would just warn that i don't

482
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:15,570
believe UK public opinion is ever likely

483
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:19,260
to be starry-eyed about the EU there is

484
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:21,780
not and will not be that visceral

485
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,910
attachment to the ideal of European

486
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,320
integration that you will have in many

487
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,720
other parts of Europe in that stems

488
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,520
largely in my view from different

489
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,870
historical experiences the mid 20th

490
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,080
century and not just on different

491
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,179
geography both play their part and

492
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,800
therefore i think the british reaction

493
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,190
will have since you always be pragmatic

494
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,960
and self-interested and the bulk of the

495
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,450
argument has to target target that

496
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,770
reality okay we've got about five

497
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,540
minutes left so we're into the quick

498
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,860
fire round quick questions quick answers

499
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,750
I'm going to ask one from another one

500
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,370
from the app this is from yeah kavalan

501
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,530
Stein from the Konrad Adenauer stiff

502
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,139
tongue this is a comment cleverly

503
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:00,000
disguised as a question do you believe

504
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,160
that the people of the out camp realize

505
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,410
how much bricks it would paralyze the EU

506
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,330
forcing us to focus on ourselves for

507
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,040
years in organ in order to organize the

508
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,570
disentanglement and making it much

509
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,060
harder to tackle issues like the

510
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,639
migration crisis do you believe that son

511
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:18,870
I mean that there is no

512
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,730
Oh unanimity of you in the out camp I

513
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:23,399
think someone some of the you kick

514
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:25,170
people would probably say yes and that's

515
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,690
rather good thing and in fairness to

516
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:30,120
Ferris I mean he said in the past that

517
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,130
yes leaving would be the UK will

518
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,750
probably be a bit poorer might be less

519
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,120
influential in the world but actually

520
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,420
that surprise worth paying what he sees

521
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:43,080
as the the benefits I think a number of

522
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:46,800
the other champions of leaving have a a

523
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,889
just a belief in fairy tales there is a

524
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,070
bly the sumption that everything would

525
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,510
could fall into place alternative

526
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,550
arrangements could be negotiated as

527
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:59,250
quickly and smoothly and I think that is

528
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,200
just ignoring reality and I think that

529
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,600
is why when you press them and what the

530
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,990
alternative is that they want the

531
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,000
response is either just to shout project

532
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,180
fear or to try and focus on something to

533
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,280
do with process it is still never to

534
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,700
give any detail or to describe the path

535
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:20,550
and the compromises that will be

536
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,650
necessary if they would seek one of

537
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,030
those alternatives I wanted to take a

538
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,710
question it's towards the back the

539
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,940
gentleman over here do you have a mic or

540
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:32,070
if someone could get one to him and

541
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,650
please be very brief Stephen rockman

542
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,080
SEPs Brussels Minister you have focused

543
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,660
primarily on the impact for Britain as

544
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,740
minister for Europe can you can you

545
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,850
envisage a scenario of brexit and

546
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,330
describe to us what the impact would be

547
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:51,600
on the European Union I mean you've got

548
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,860
a obviously you need to edit it to David

549
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,139
by the governments to speak for

550
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,050
themselves but my my view would be

551
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,960
destabilizing and destabilizing at a

552
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:03,840
time when Europe as I've said faces

553
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:07,320
profound economic and political and

554
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:12,470
security challenges I think that it

555
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:14,909
would it would certainly remove the

556
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,190
biggest champion of open markets and

557
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,750
free trade from the table and I think

558
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,110
there'd be a risk there for that Europe

559
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,290
would be become more protectionist more

560
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:27,840
risk of rejection 'used arguments and

561
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:34,750
that would harm Europe's competitive

562
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:40,840
and cost jobs I think that the the in

563
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:46,690
terms of maintaining a determined front

564
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:48,250
in the face of Russian aggression that

565
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,200
would be weakened I think that Europe's

566
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,150
foreign policy and security capacity

567
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,100
would be weakened because you'd be

568
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,580
taking out one of the biggest diplomatic

569
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,350
and military players so I think it would

570
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,780
be bad news how would the rest of how

571
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,820
the 27 respond it's really for them to

572
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,530
say but I think they would certainly and

573
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,580
I'm very clear from conversations I've

574
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:12,149
had some at least would then push for a

575
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,990
very quickly towards further

576
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,180
integrations try and restore stability

577
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:19,450
and I think that then runs up against

578
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:22,840
the sort of challenge you have from

579
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:26,500
villip ends and the yobics and the

580
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:29,889
five-star movements and others who would

581
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,490
see that as inimical to to healing the

582
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,900
breach between the public opinion and

583
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,910
what a scene as remote decision takers

584
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,410
now we only have about a minute and a

585
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,060
half left so i'm going to abuse my

586
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,880
progressiveness the chair and ask the

587
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,919
final question myself ministered the

588
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,870
Prime Minister has said that he's

589
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,490
confident that Britain would be able to

590
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,409
flourish if we were outside of the

591
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,420
European Union but of course that would

592
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,670
in large part depend on what sort of

593
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,350
deal Britain were able to obtain with

594
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,540
the EU in the subsequent negotiations

595
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,250
that would take place are you confident

596
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,620
that those negotiate that you would have

597
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,540
a helpful negotiating partner on the

598
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,860
other side of the table if Britain were

599
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,659
to leave and that you would be able to

600
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,129
get a good deal on things like access to

601
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,020
the single market trade and so on I

602
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,150
think you would either you would seek to

603
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,740
do so but Prime Minister has never

604
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,810
underestimated the difficulties we

605
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,270
export something like forty four percent

606
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:22,510
of everything we sell abroad to the rest

607
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:24,550
of the EU vu 27 collectively export

608
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,550
seven to eight percent and what they

609
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:29,139
sell to the UK so the boots on the other

610
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,950
foot I think particularly give the

611
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,330
two-year deadline Audrey article 53rd

612
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,100
the exit negotiations to take place

613
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,110
after which the departing state is

614
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,719
automatically out with the rights and

615
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,240
obligations that flow from membership

616
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,380
I think that the UK is a big enough

617
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:51,460
player you know a fifth for biggest

618
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:54,730
economy in the world no actually we are

619
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:59,140
we are you know the the job-creating

620
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:03,730
center of Europe at the moment no we

621
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:05,380
could cope but I like the PM believe

622
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:07,630
that that would be very far from the

623
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,720
best alternative I think would be less

624
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:13,270
prosperous we'd have less opportunity

625
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,679
outside and I think we would not to go

626
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:17,620
to the plums what we would not be

627
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,080
playing the role we should aspire to in

628
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,989
terms of shaping the European and the

629
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,899
Western challenge to a period of great

630
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:28,030
global challenge well on that note we'll

631
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,230
have to wrap it up I've been asked to

632
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,690
remind you that lunch is available

633
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,940
outside in the lobby and downstairs and

634
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,520
make me let me also remind you to be

635
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,409
back here for 2 15 when we will have

636
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,629
another session also chaired by me on

637
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,980
the critical issue of the future of

638
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,690
Europe please join me in thanking

639
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,690
minister of Europe David living
