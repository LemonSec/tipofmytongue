1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,340
second decade of excellence like the

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,110
first one was website has become the

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,540
most influential security conference

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,700
east of munich by now with original

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,029
slavic niche regional settings and also

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,250
worldwide outreach helping us to find

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,150
solutions to some of the most pressing

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,769
international issues of our times last I

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,829
spoke about it when you met here last

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,810
year then 10 months ago we were more

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,910
optimistic and we then we are today and

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,000
I while opening this conference try to

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,319
spread out some positive messages

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,660
unfortunately migration and terrorism

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,750
shattered our basic understanding of

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,760
reality in Europe and beyond and now

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,640
it's our challenge but also our

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,339
responsibility to search for avenues to

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,310
make sure that this confident continent

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,860
is still safe rules-based and in control

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:08,490
and that's also the message that we have

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,680
to send out of Europe to our partners

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,240
the message of determination but this

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,820
could and should be also an opportunity

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,780
to ask yourself some suggestive

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,869
questions for example on how we departed

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,570
from vision of Europe Holland free to

28
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:28,770
the increasing gap between its people

29
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,350
and the EU integration project from

30
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,499
passion for membership to enlargement

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,130
malice all the way to Euro skepticism

32
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:40,318
and mistrust and even to the threat of

33
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,408
the first-ever disintegration in

34
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,740
European Union from a moral narrative on

35
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:51,030
migration to the rise of far-right

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,929
forces and extremism from the Arab

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:58,170
Spring hopes to fail state Islamic

38
00:01:54,929 --> 00:02:00,450
radicalization dies brutality and terror

39
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,590
attacks in the European capitals and

40
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:08,310
scores of non-eu countries from the high

41
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,160
expectations of the second maiden to

42
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,700
this post Soviet sobering reality of

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,130
Ukrainian internal politics from seeking

44
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,220
Russia as a strategic partner to our

45
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,819
solutions to seeing Russia rather as a

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,849
strategic dialogue

47
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:28,160
from the EU energy union projects to the

48
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:31,670
internal divisions over the South dream

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,489
or no dream projects so this is the

50
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:38,929
perspective this year and Beyond breaks

51
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:41,799
it nigh gratian terrorism and add the

52
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:45,290
Ukraine crisis the middle is thermal

53
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:47,810
instability in North Africa and so on it

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,569
all shows that the youth that Europe the

55
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:54,190
safest of islands is surrounded by the

56
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:57,349
bloodiest conflicts on our planet but

57
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:00,019
alarming is also a gap between what

58
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:03,768
boats elites say and common people think

59
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:06,829
a feeling is strong that the period of

60
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:09,950
peace stability and even prosperity

61
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:15,200
might be on decline and automatic

62
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:19,190
guarantee that democracy will prevail is

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,988
questioned more than a modern option do

64
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,239
we have the capacity to tackle these

65
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:25,910
challenges without trying to think out

66
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,130
of the box and confront our traditional

67
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:33,079
European idealism with ruthless

68
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:35,480
realpolitik facing unhurt barbarism to

69
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,389
confront our deeply rooted humanism with

70
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,358
broken safety after unprecedented wave

71
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:44,870
of terror or to confront our political

72
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,910
correctness with the need of

73
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,880
communication clarity to hold the rise

74
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,489
of extremism to be even more provocative

75
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,349
let me quote the philosopher Karl Popper

76
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,319
who once said about tolerance and I

77
00:03:54,349 --> 00:04:00,168
quote if we extend unlimited tolerance

78
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,790
even to those who are intolerant if we

79
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:04,370
are not prepared to defend a tolerant

80
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:07,578
society against the onslaught of the

81
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:11,049
intolerant then the tolerant will be

82
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:15,169
destroyed and the tolerance with them

83
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:18,739
does I wish to see the European Union to

84
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:23,750
be more real more political and more

85
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:26,138
global real because there are some who

86
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,849
see our ideals is our weakness and

87
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,610
therefore we must add some realism into

88
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:32,998
our thinking exactly to protect these

89
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,769
ideas

90
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:37,539
political as we have to upgrade the

91
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:40,629
European Union's bureaucratic foundation

92
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:43,539
into strategic action we need to adjust

93
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:46,599
our sometimes clumsy policymaking to

94
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:48,519
ever faster political reality and global

95
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:51,219
for time it's right to take a more

96
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:54,369
strategic approach after being in word

97
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:55,599
looking for so long hopefully the EU

98
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:57,729
global strategy which is under

99
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:00,688
preparation and upcoming NATO summit

100
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:03,639
will give us some inspiration it is real

101
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:06,369
ladies and gentlemen slovakia will work

102
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,039
with these and many other issues during

103
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:11,859
our upcoming EU presidency so the more

104
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,649
complex your deliberations here are the

105
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:17,378
more useful they might be for us during

106
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:19,359
our presidency but I also believe they

107
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:22,449
will help us better understand current

108
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:24,369
global state of play finally let me

109
