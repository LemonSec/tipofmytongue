1
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:14,549
thank you very much dear madam president

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:19,970
of Croatia excellencies distinguished

3
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:23,279
guests ladies and gentlemen last year

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:27,029
many of our conversations were about

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,410
whether the world has changed for good

6
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:36,559
or if you are just going through a bad

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,800
moment whether it was a storm or

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,209
complete

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:47,010
climate change this year the trouble

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:51,449
continues Ukraine our neighbor remains

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,870
wounded more lives have been lost to

12
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:58,500
terrorism in Paris Istanbul Middle East

13
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,419
African countries or recently in

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,659
Brussels the basic international norms

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:10,260
are still being violated and the number

16
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,689
of people in need leaving their homes in

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,240
search for a better life is still huge

18
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:21,899
and yet even the world outside continues

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:27,600
to be a dangerous place I want to speak

20
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:33,570
about something else something we may

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:38,009
not fully comprehend yet I think we have

22
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:44,970
to take deep and honest look at what's

23
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:48,600
going on in our very own societies not

24
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:52,020
just in Slovakia but it other decent

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:58,199
democracies or western part of the world

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:00,780
as well the picture we are getting these

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,439
days from our societies is somehow

28
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,619
baffling we have modern tools to

29
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:12,480
communicate the best ones in our history

30
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,940
and yet we sometimes fail to deliver a

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,970
message

32
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:21,200
years after the Cold War we are facing

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:24,350
the new wave of political propaganda and

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:29,640
information Wars so intense and

35
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:33,299
efficient that they again have the power

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:37,290
to manipulate the mood in our societies

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:42,500
or even cripple important political

38
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:46,709
outcomes and as a result to weaken our

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:50,280
security we can see disturbing signals

40
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:54,870
about the depth of this challenge the

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:03:01,220
word decent becomes symbol of weakness

42
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:04,050
and the word extreme symbol of strength

43
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:07,609
extreme political parties and movements

44
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:10,890
are getting stronger in many countries

45
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:14,700
even the mainstream politicians can't

46
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:18,238
resist to retreat or even echo the

47
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:22,518
language of simple popular but wrong

48
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:26,850
solutions and on the other hand moderate

49
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:31,260
value basis politics is often seen as

50
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:33,810
weak old-fashioned and not fancy enough

51
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:39,269
in the face of course to tear down the

52
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:42,930
walls of the existing system the

53
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:46,049
pressure to undermine and dismiss our

54
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:50,940
core values and principles the building

55
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:53,730
blocks of our societies is growing the

56
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,220
level of this threat may not be the same

57
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,738
across all our countries because the

58
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,109
strength and foundations of the open

59
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:06,540
societies are not the same across our

60
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:10,680
countries but one thing is common to all

61
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:15,420
of us the pressure is fed by the

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,840
information wars but also by our own in

63
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,238
efficiency to explain and to deliver

64
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,169
solutions for our domestic and global

65
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,169
problems

66
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,750
we cannot act as as if the history has

67
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,630
ended because this is not the first time

68
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,380
when liberal democratic societies are

69
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:41,940
under the pressure the previous century

70
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:47,610
told us how such mistakes can lead to

71
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:50,930
dangerous outcome we can't take our

72
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,370
values and principles for granted I

73
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,490
understand that we are busy with the

74
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:59,730
high politics strategic challenges and

75
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,330
the complexity of everyday that task we

76
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:08,280
have to face but those issues are

77
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:11,820
connected in fact it is the values and

78
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,840
the principles that are the ultimate

79
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:18,270
target of the propaganda encouraging

80
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,190
goals from dark dark corners of our

81
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:27,349
societies extremism xenophobia in

82
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,350
general suspicion against democracy our

83
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:36,240
values and priest principles are not

84
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,210
self explanatory it would be a mistake

85
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,680
to fall under this illusion and to

86
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:45,989
forget to talk about them at all we will

87
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,080
not be able to counter hoaxes and

88
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,410
misinformation if we abandon the

89
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:57,810
ambition to calibrate the moral compass

90
00:05:52,410 --> 00:06:01,950
of our societies the answer to boiling

91
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:05,760
anger cannot be Coverley silence ladies

92
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,800
and gentlemen I am NOT talking about the

93
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,900
importance of values and principles to

94
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,919
give some abstract moral lesson

95
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:17,520
I just want to underline how important

96
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,280
is to halt the slow erosion of trust in

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,640
our societies because it leads to

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:28,650
serious political and security

99
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:31,950
consequences here in this room we all

100
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:34,849
know we had a lot to digest in the

101
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:38,248
previous years and still not to face

102
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:42,569
financial crisis risk of Greg

103
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:47,299
ukrane refugee crisis terrorism risk of

104
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:52,399
brexit tackling these issues takes time

105
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:55,198
will an ability to compromise sometimes

106
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,539
we simply have to try to come up with

107
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,299
something only to learn from our

108
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:04,109
mistakes afterwards but we also

109
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:07,349
understand the democratic societies are

110
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:09,719
in fact best equipped to handle benefit

111
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:13,229
from this creative process of solution

112
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:15,659
signal seeking that's why we are living

113
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:20,758
in the most prosperous and safe part of

114
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:23,629
the world but honestly I can I can

115
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,689
understand why part of our societies

116
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:30,389
perceives this recent events as

117
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:34,079
seemingly endless queue of troubles and

118
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,909
failures so things like the results of

119
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,979
last week's referendum in Nederland

120
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:41,759
shouldn't surprise us shouldn't surprise

121
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:44,039
us but this should not be a reason to

122
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,299
give up on searching for common

123
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:51,589
solutions because if we give up if we

124
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:55,799
fail to fight with skepticism extremism

125
00:07:51,589 --> 00:08:00,209
nationalism we may get caught in a loop

126
00:07:55,799 --> 00:08:04,888
of damage control rushed plans B Plan C

127
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:07,319
plans D and face the fact that we will

128
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:14,369
repeatedly hit the wall of distrusting

129
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:16,949
public in one or another country so we

130
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:21,569
should spare no opportunity to remind

131
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:26,099
ourself of irresponsible role of the EON

132
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:28,110
better our unity and stability to speak

133
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:32,610
frankly about our security and

134
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:36,659
challenges we face to explain the young

135
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:40,050
ones why we have no better alternatives

136
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:42,558
to freedom and democracy to understand

137
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:45,809
the value of solidarity and unity to

138
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:49,679
stress the importance of being able to

139
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:51,149
compromise but also to remain principled

140
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:57,040
when necessary

141
00:08:51,149 --> 00:09:00,750
to show here in this region that the v4

142
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,599
is about empathy and cooperation and

143
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:10,390
that we can't ever abandon our humanity

144
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:13,120
no matter what difficulties we face so I

145
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,970
wish you all the best when you discuss

146
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,140
how to improve cooperation intelligence

147
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:24,880
or enhanced NATO presence but let's keep

148
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:28,779
in mind we are only strong if we manage

149
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,529
to remain healthy in the core of our

150
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:37,480
societies in the hearts and minds of our

151
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:40,779
people because the strongest foundation

152
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:45,220
of our safety and defense is when people

153
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:49,620
understand there is a lot to lose and a

154
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,620
lot worth defending thank you very much

155
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,050
thank you thank you very much for

156
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,500
excellent opening you're setting the

157
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,490
stage and let me wish our participants

158
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,490
with conference
