00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:15,260
even in times of toughest challenges not

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,689
to choose between either security or

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:23,369
humanity but to choose a path that

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:26,609
combines both of them presence presence

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:31,679
once again presence of military the

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:35,450
troops from different NATO countries the

frustrations that radicalize so many

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,599
people is their utter conviction that

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,340
they'll never receive justice from their

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,340
own state from their own country
