8
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:34,460
presidency tradition and endorsing and

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,219
supporting the gloves a conference over

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,820
the years glob sig has become a major

11
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:42,980
achievement maybe the biggest similar

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,769
security conference in this part of

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,078
Europe and our slack friends have

14
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:50,239
managed to set up a four map which

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,600
provides a forum for time early debate

16
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,059
and which has earned a reputation

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,300
extending beyond regional borders it's

18
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:02,419
very important right now the security

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,878
situation in Europe and beyond which

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,990
began to deteriorate a few years ago is

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:12,740
far from settled we need to put up with

22
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:15,979
manifold security risk in many ways we

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:19,310
are running to catch up as fast as we

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:24,920
are try to adapt so the circumstances

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:27,080
change since we last met the migration

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,230
crisis has developed into a major

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:34,280
challenge the situation in eastern

28
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:36,110
Ukraine has stalled in to a stalemate we

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,590
have seen a game-changing Russian

30
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,270
military campaign in Syria dash and the

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,120
pressure in its middle eastern

32
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,449
stronghold has shifted its activities

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,000
else we're setting up franchises across

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,510
the region and launching a campaign to

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,820
target Europeans at home other areas

36
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:59,720
have recently emerged as a zones of

37
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:04,399
conflict nagorno-karabakh is in southern

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:07,340
Caucasus being one prominent example all

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,180
these areas of conflict and contention

40
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:15,890
risk escalating into what could be a

41
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:19,100
major clash to succeed in our mission

42
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,369
we will need to come up with responses

43
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:25,910
which are carefully considered and

44
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:29,240
prudent the great benefit of glob sec

45
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:32,930
lies in its contribution to the framing

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,910
of such responses glob sec provides the

47
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,150
opportunity for vital informal dialogue

48
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:40,820
across borders across professional

49
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,810
occupations and across ideological

50
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:47,690
divides a dialogue which stimulates

51
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:52,700
original ideas some melting pot as was

52
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:56,600
said and ideas on from which we can all

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:03:00,560
learn I wish you all an enjoyable

54
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,140
experience may mail make the best of

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,600
discussions both in conference rooms and

56
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,600
in more informal setting thank you
