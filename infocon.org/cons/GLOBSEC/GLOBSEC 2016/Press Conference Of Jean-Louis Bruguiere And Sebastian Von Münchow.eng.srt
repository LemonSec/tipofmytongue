with question related to security issues

15
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:33,190
parliamentary oversight and terrorism

16
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,190
gentlemen

17
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,610
thank you just some remarks and some

18
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:55,330
question about your problems or

19
00:01:51,610 --> 00:02:00,010
financing terrorism which is maybe right

20
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:04,150
now with new attacks in Europe strands

21
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:06,640
and inverses crucial issue because it

22
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,679
was not possible of car to carry out

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,950
search operation to finance or certain

24
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,320
groups because my expectation that I

25
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,839
think we have more than 50 persons or no

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,650
oh all the group had not been Dementors

27
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,350
as a time and maybe between 15 maybe 100

28
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,050
people at a lot and so that's mean to

29
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:29,170
have to have resources or money and the

30
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,970
problem of financing is crucial is very

31
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,179
important to make a difference for me

32
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,840
according to my experience about what we

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,900
have you know in Syria and N and in the

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,989
call you know an anorak we have a lot of

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,410
money you know dash succeeded to have an

36
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:49,510
impressive amount of money several

37
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,739
billions of US dollars that's not seen

38
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:56,739
before but in fact you know the sense

39
00:02:53,739 --> 00:03:00,730
operating outside you know the network's

40
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:03,340
implied involve in operations to you

41
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:08,140
know to detect you know the target to

42
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:11,200
organize you know the operations to have

43
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,690
safe house to have you know a munitions

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,480
rifle and so on that's a fine answer is

45
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,090
a small financing system and this

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,760
financing system is you know connect

47
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,680
comes from criminality the connection

48
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,048
between the terrorists and criminality

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,630
is not very new you know I've

50
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,430
experienced that before before and the

51
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,430
problem you know and all this money

52
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,590
comes not from some comes from South

53
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,209
Syria not really because it's very

54
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,000
difficult to transfer money they know

55
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:42,160
that you monitor by any systems are you

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,190
as a French users have the possibility

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,320
to connect and two monitors

58
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,480
the financial market is finish of the

59
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,540
banks so is a palimony you know on

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,299
rotary and and and there are many many

61
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,329
means for that you know the burglars you

62
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,820
know the fruits the credit card frauds

63
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,650
and specially right now something

64
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,650
they're quite new and very important is

65
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,800
the traffic the smuggling of cigarette

66
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,960
ebc trade of tobacco that's representing

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,470
very important about right now about 10

68
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,049
million 10 billion of euro per years you

69
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:20,858
know in Europe that's a lot of course

70
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:22,960
this money was not used only by that is

71
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,780
used by you know the criminal by the

72
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,700
black the black market but is the

73
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,159
important resources where was this

74
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,229
country feed product also is quite use

75
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,150
you have many meanings saying that that

76
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,370
so that's the reason why is very

77
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,429
difficult for us for the law enforcement

78
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,100
to judiciary intelligence to detect this

79
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,900
flow because the exchange is by cash and

80
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,120
don't you have no trace about that

81
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,799
that's a very big problem the other

82
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,720
reason why it is very important you know

83
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,669
to exchange information between zero

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,280
enforcement agency inside the country

85
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:57,549
and outside in order to detect them to

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,650
staunch this money because if you

87
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,560
succeed that we have a very good blood

88
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:06,609
we know to stop the terrorist operation

89
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,090
thank you very much good morning ladies

90
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:13,330
and gentlemen yesterday night night old

91
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:18,729
session was a very good opportunity not

92
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,840
only to visit what what you Jia Jia just

93
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,720
explained

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,198
organized crime terrorism nexus in the

95
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:31,100
narrow sense in a specific area but also

96
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,780
in the in a broader context if you wish

97
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:39,320
that the maser Angela de Marco level so

98
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:44,630
latest research shows we can talk about

99
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:46,040
a crime instability Nexus right whereas

100
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,419
in former times we fought like okay

101
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,020
organized crimes organized crime

102
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,510
terrorism is terrorism now with a fert

103
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:58,250
player the so-called shadow facilitator

104
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:59,870
or the fixers or the super fixers we

105
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,260
have a phenomenon which is much more

106
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,630
dangerous so it's about the proceeds of

107
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,870
crime the money she was was talking

108
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,930
about which is then going to enter in

109
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,680
may be legitimate business real estate

110
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:18,139
what what what have you and it has a

111
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,010
destabilizing effect in transition

112
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:24,590
countries in post-conflict countries

113
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,650
also in the Western Hemisphere and some

114
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,080
of the latest academic say this is

115
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:33,739
undermining the understanding of

116
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,550
sobriety or the westphalian state if you

117
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:40,940
if you wish and that of course will

118
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,500
probably hinder development look just

119
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,690
look at the figures were organized crime

120
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,210
is or crime and the Human Development

121
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,960
Index you will find it matches and this

122
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:53,099
danger we were able to discuss yesterday

123
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,989
night

124
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,740
thank you very much this is the space

125
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,740
for your questions

126
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,970
good morning Susanna Gabrielle from your

127
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,479
active my question would be whether

128
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,040
there are any indication that some of

129
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,710
the financing of terrorism in Europe

130
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,250
comes from the finances that the

131
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:21,909
smugglers of refugees are able to do

132
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:27,340
collect within the current refugee

133
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:29,560
crisis yes yes and no be careful we

134
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,330
could have some connections but for me

135
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,120
the connection is not the most important

136
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,390
the problem is manipulations that's very

137
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,910
crucial because it's not because we have

138
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,419
discovered some three or four peoples

139
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,950
who are involved you know in the Paris

140
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:48,219
attacks or Britain's as a matter of fact

141
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:51,070
that means that all the refugee refugee

142
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:55,500
is the flows of Asia is a main stream

143
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:59,140
you know to to conduct you know

144
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,140
terrorists in Europe's but but you know

145
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:05,080
the problems that that dash manipulate

146
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:09,400
these systems in orders to make you know

147
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:12,130
to make to promote the terror filling in

148
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,169
Europe that's a new tool of terrors and

149
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,240
so we should be very prudent of course

150
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,849
because because the manipulation is

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,240
democratic order is emphasized by the

152
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:25,270
media the media of course you know focus

153
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,030
about this problem and and and the goal

154
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:31,900
of that is to make you know it make you

155
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:36,579
know that to make a disturbed in inside

156
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:39,370
our society and try to oppose some you

157
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,680
know clan in our peoples in our society

158
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,710
in others to make you know a big disturb

159
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,050
right that's the goal you know to break

160
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,210
the consensus or social consensus you

161
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,099
know in our democratic order does it

162
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,680
also we should be very prudent about

163
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,530
that myanna that's a matter of fact that

164
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,630
use but in fact I think it's one one

165
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,610
person no more the problem is elsewhere

166
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,689
but the manipulation is much more

167
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,690
important is very dangerous

168
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,620
okay next question is the magic thank

169
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:14,130
you under my check daily pravda could

170
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,740
you please say a little bit more about

171
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:23,290
this next as you mentioned the organized

172
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:26,170
crime purism and start because yeah we

173
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,810
have this discussion at blob sick but

174
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,639
correct me if I am wrong but I don't

175
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,800
think this is like a really new

176
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:39,430
phenomenon so maybe it was evolving

177
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,500
somehow and maybe a little bit more

178
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,930
broadly I don't know I'm writing about

179
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,430
those issues in all 13 years and of

180
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,949
course we are always talking about the

181
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,829
financing terrorism and stopping finance

182
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:53,109
so if you can you say for example I

183
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:56,079
don't know from them from 9-11 what

184
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:59,350
happened what where are our successes

185
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:01,920
and and a little bit also about failure

186
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,920
thank you

187
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:12,670
huge pleasure will will will tell you

188
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:15,430
that the phenomenon is not new what we

189
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,819
believe in in a marshal center and we

190
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:21,010
have 700 students from the security

191
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,640
architecture from all over the world for

192
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:27,700
a year in our college so there is a

193
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:31,420
exchange also with practitioners from

194
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:34,270
from from out there is the understanding

195
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:40,930
maybe that the threat perception is is

196
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:44,500
new if the fish on this nexus for

197
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:49,660
instance there is diamond mining

198
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:52,300
somewhere in central Africa which is

199
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,030
probably not done in the legitimate

200
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,569
sense as we believe mining should should

201
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:00,790
be done in our part of the world then

202
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,700
how do you get it out from there you

203
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:06,790
need a shadow facilitator how do you get

204
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:12,130
it across oceans you need a shadow

205
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:14,230
facilitator and then the end user the

206
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,570
final destinations so there's there's a

207
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:20,290
sort of a hierarchy yeah but ultimately

208
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:22,690
this is this is all in flux and the

209
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:26,110
security architectures are now about to

210
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:30,160
understand it there are international

211
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:35,020
tools now on the table some are still in

212
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,390
the drafting process plus as mr. bouge

213
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:41,410
pointed out we need to cooperate more on

214
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:43,900
that we need to share information not

215
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,010
only state to state but also the

216
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:51,660
institutions inside the state maybe also

217
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:55,990
state public sector and private sector

218
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,480
many many many players ultimately how do

219
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,459
you fight a network of a network

220
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,639
and this is this is what we try to

221
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,638
achieve

222
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,450
ok now you agree now cooperation is

223
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,220
crucial right now you know where we are

224
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,610
facing a global threat that's a matter

225
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,800
of fact no but the response is too many

226
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,450
fragmented right now especially inside

227
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,540
of the country because the connections

228
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,940
sometimes is not sufficient between your

229
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,280
intelligence the police you know the ROI

230
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,840
enforcement says judiciary we have some

231
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,319
connection quite will be difficult and

232
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,460
so the response you know is not

233
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,650
responsive it's not you know we cut

234
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,930
waste time in response that's a very big

235
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,449
problem and the major problem for me is

236
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,280
Europe Europe you know is big problem as

237
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,350
you know because the cooperation is

238
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,900
globally good is not a problem no

239
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,850
political issue for that but in fact

240
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,459
practically speaking it's much more

241
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,680
complicated because it sort is a set of

242
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,510
sovereign state the premier sovereignty

243
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,599
as you know you know the prime of

244
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,460
security globally speaking is only of

245
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,830
the capitals of a member state not of

246
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,570
European Union's you know Europe all or

247
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,820
you resist adjustment to make

248
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,370
corporations they are not is not FBI

249
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,890
system you know of course and so the

250
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,710
prime of cooperation is crucial and yo

251
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:15,199
what is important for example that each

252
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,620
member state I have experiences in my

253
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,740
when I was in our dokie and I'm is on

254
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,810
you know perspective and experience in

255
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,850
thread in no specifics of the strength

256
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,099
the passage of the sweat in France was

257
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,500
not the same you know 10 years ago was

258
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,540
his pain for Spain was important it was

259
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,930
a there is open to the basque programs

260
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,270
UK was IRA remember that so it's very

261
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,630
difficult you know speaker is speaking

262
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:44,120
to have you know to have the same

263
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:46,220
intensity of a detection for two two or

264
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,920
three sweat you focus on one and you can

265
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,890
neglect users and so problem is you know

266
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,870
if you do that you end a mine in Rihanna

267
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,430
the global you know fight and

268
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,430
understanding your batteries because it

269
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,410
is I'm not this agenda yeah they use the

270
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,270
global you know the globality of

271
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,790
Europe's they move very quickly from one

272
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,130
state to others same solution can zone

273
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,910
and so from if you have not a global

274
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,860
understanding and reactions in real time

275
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,550
we can you know we can succeeded in the

276
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,620
future

277
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,899
okay thank you very much unfortunately

278
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,300
we are short of time so we have to

279
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:24,880
finish so I want to thank the gentleman

280
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,269
for being with us and thank you for

281
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,269
attention

282
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:48,540
the last scheduled press conference let

283
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,939
