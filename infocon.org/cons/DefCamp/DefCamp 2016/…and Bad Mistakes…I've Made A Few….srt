00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,399
you have an issue when you have a

security thing you know who to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

471
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,149
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> searched out all aspects of</font>

just you

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one of my biggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems so</font>

517
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">so yeah that's how that started working</font>

518
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,090
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I literally had an issue where we</font>

519
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,650
went and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was with the team i'm not</font>

520
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about them because this is</font>

521
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:24,470
about my<font color="#CCCCCC"> fail</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we had to deal with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the guy for the client and this guy was</font>

a horrible jerk<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> networking by</font>

the way just FYI<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

525
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,440
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I'd mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for no</font>

526
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,149

527
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,220
not really happy with us

528
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,960
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it could have been the</font>

529
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,750
fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I stole his laptop off his</font>

530
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,190
desk and the cable for his computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

one of the cookies on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this plate that</font>

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,120
may have been a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may be</font>

533
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,620
contributing factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but he literally</font>

534
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,429
was not very pleasant to deal with in

535
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,389
the best of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

536
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:56,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so a couple of members of our team</font>

537
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:59,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were nice enough to get domain</font>

password hashes and decrypt all their

passwords for the last you know year or

542
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,980
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we were able to look at his</font>

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:15,410
user ID and all the passwords used in

544
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,370
the last two years and we noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

545
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:21,890
important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> he used the same word</font>

546
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">but then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers and stuff at the</font>

547
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:28,190
end of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's how he changed it</font>

548
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:30,740
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't a common word but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

549
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,450
will tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it was a word that was</font>

550
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">calm enough that we were able to use it</font>

551
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:39,680
in a conversation that we had with him

552

<font color="#E5E5E5">his boss his boss's boss and our boss</font>

to deal with that didn't make it

597

unlikely places like networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

600
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,750
because when you actually go into an

management management has brought me in

612
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:20,239
here because they want to listen to my

opinion on the vulnerabilities of the

I'm not gonna surprise you hardly with

was sort of sad my heart<font color="#E5E5E5"> died a little</font>

bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i logged in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did a graceful</font>

00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:13,069
shutdown of that server in the middle of

00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:24,258
and guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

not a report three months later saying

these are all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that we were</font>

that's helpful

858
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,379
so you give them something to look at

859
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:18,790
you give them something to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

860
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:23,319
what we need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to be more</font>

00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:32,829
other words you're dealing with humans

00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,629
for a client and you broke into their

869
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:45,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">service do you realize that there's</font>

870
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:47,770
people there that are responsible for

00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:49,779
those servers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

that affects the human being on the

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,510
for that

879
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:12,480
so everything that you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact humans</font>

880

<font color="#CCCCCC">life</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do your reports accordingly</font>
