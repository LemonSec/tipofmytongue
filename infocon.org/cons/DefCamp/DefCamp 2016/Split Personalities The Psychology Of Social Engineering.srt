doing a conference and you do not

10
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:29,849
realize how much work goes into this so

11
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:33,239
please give them a lot of attention a

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,329
we're going to talk a little bit today

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,850
about social engineering and some of the

20
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,100
misconceptions that there are it and

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,559
really how we can handle this and look

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,170
at psychology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in some of the</font>

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,140
research to get us to understand that

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,740
this is a problem that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">will face and and we can't really get</font>

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,770
away from it

27
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually used my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jedi mind power to</font>

28
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,610
knock that over right there

29
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,529
so before we get started a little bit

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,289
about myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am a security</font>

32
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,900
there's a lot of researchers here<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

33
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,229
this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a good thing but I</font>

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,750
run an ethical hacking firm<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font>

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:39,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to discuss is stuff that I do on a</font>

40
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,429
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the right technology</font>

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,559
you're good to go

42
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,140
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then over the past decade I've</font>

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,200
started to realize there's the human

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:02,159
factor in this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that really just</font>

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed changed up the game so I again</font>

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting we do all sorts of</font>

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,579
things i do not do tech support anymore

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,780
so we come in we say here's your

49
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,950
problems

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,349
goodbye and move on from there

51
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a</font>

52
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:19,790
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about social engineering and</font>

53
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you've heard this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go around</font>

54
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">throughout today and yesterday yesterday</font>

55
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,930
morning adjacent<font color="#CCCCCC"> Street talked a lot</font>

56
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,030
about social engineering and as someone

57
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,220
that's been sharing cab rides with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

58
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,890
can tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's social engineers free</font>

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,760
cab rides<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time</font>

60
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:43,010
there's a lot of misconceptions about

61
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,959
social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and this is one</font>

62
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,140
of those definitions that you'll see the

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,780
clever manipulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tendency to trust</font>

64
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,089
is what is social engineering social

65
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:58,250
engineering is actually hacking the

66
00:02:53,090 --> 00:03:00,319
human now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll go around in our field</font>

67
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you'll see something like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

68
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,149
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend of mine Ralph richmondva</font>

69
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually has a patch like this and you</font>

70
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,040
know social engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> because all</font>

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">right no patch for human stupidity right</font>

72
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we always say that why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do you get it</font>

73
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they were stupid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

74
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:21,078
absolutely stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

75
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the number one issue we need to</font>

76
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:26,810
stop and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's let's put it</font>

77
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,660
this way if it was truly the fact that

78
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,000
someone was able to be social<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineer</font>

79
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they were stupid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then when</font>

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself or someone else came in and did a</font>

81
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:40,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">fishing engagement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you fell for it</font>

82
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,238
your company should fire you<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

83
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:45,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you're too stupid that that's</font>

84
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,380
the whole reason

85
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,750
no it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can come in and we can</font>

86
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,630
train and as we're going to see the

87
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason social engineering works is not</font>

88
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:00,290
because humans are stupid

89
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,870
it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely complex now</font>

90
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,440
let's go ahead and let's look at how

91
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,620
humans are built<font color="#E5E5E5"> design evolved however</font>

92
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,380
you want to look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have this</font>

93
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,230
one side of us and we'll use<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill here</font>

94
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,529
as an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> aside that's very logical</font>

95
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,930
that we think we do risk assessments

96
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,239
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the street</font>

97
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,280
and there's a garbage truck<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming do we</font>

98
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,889
run across<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

99
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,340
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

100
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:31,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that which by the way you guys are</font>

101
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:36,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the third</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world's worst</font>

103
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:44,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am so glad I'm not driving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

104
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">um you make logical choices and yes this</font>

105
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,360
is very spot cash right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start a Star</font>

106
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">Trek</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fans here</font>

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok it's a star wars sort of country I</font>

108
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:58,258
get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yoda ish then you know we</font>

109
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:01,289
come in and we were able to look at an

110
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:05,969
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're able to reason it's a very</font>

111
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:08,699
high complex form and something that

112
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:12,120
until recently we thought only humans

113
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,939
possessed<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the problem lies that we</font>

114
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,719
have a second side<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have an emotional</font>

115
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:22,139
side and this is a lot older primitive

116
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:28,469
side now it's not very complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

117
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:33,300
problem is is that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> trumps any any</font>

118
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:35,400
rational or logical thought you may have

119
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,279
there's a phrase we use in America

120
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,560
called knee-jerk reaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

121
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,089
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just did</font>

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,069
something right

123
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:46,800
someone called your name<font color="#CCCCCC"> you punch him</font>

124
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:48,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a knee-jerk reaction right now</font>

125
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,729
the thing is is what we have to

126
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,629
understand is for social engineering to

127
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:55,620
work

128
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:59,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's very simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I get you to not think</font>

129
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:04,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">I get you to feel if i get you to feel</font>

130
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:08,399
that emotion<font color="#E5E5E5"> overwhelms any logic that</font>

131
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:12,149
you have and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you to</font>

132
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,919
do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you guys may have heard</font>

133
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:18,029
that our country just went through an

134
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,039

175
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:11,069
problem here<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the big issue that we</font>

176
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:13,199
run into is if we can use this and

177
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,119
weaponize this to get past your

178
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,709
technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> defenses</font>

179
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:21,119
what are we to do well let's go back and

180
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:24,239
let's look at what some of the

181
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:27,029
researchers say<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we'll go back a</font>

182
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:31,739
couple hundred years ago and a certain

183
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:34,110
gentleman came up with this phrase<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

184
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:34,978
<font color="#CCCCCC">ito</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her go some anybody know what that</font>

185
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,719
means

186
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:43,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think therefore I am</font>

187
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that was mr.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rene</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to car and he</font>

188
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,480
actually said you know this is this is

189
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:51,779
the first realization<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think I'm</font>

190
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,350
logical<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

191
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:58,410
I'm not just some function just walking

192
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:01,680
around like a plant<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am actually human</font>

193
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so this is what we have held onto</font>

194
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,969
for couple hundred years but what we're

195
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:12,809
finding is research says you as a person

196
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not a logical person just because</font>

197
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:19,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think that does not make up you any</font>

198
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,189
Germans in here

203
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,149
play

204
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:39,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">Herbert said listen this is a whole uh</font>

205
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:42,180
research piece he did back in the

206
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:44,699
sixties and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you want to say</font>

207
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,939
is that when we want to talk about

208
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:53,279
rational thinking when we want to dot

209
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:57,660
discuss how humans react logically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

210
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,959
have to understand what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> role emotion</font>

211
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,569
plays into it and really what what he

212
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:08,309
was starting to get it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> none of us are</font>

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I fire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we returned and I</font>

268
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,589
went over and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr. him i said that's</font>

269
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,329
really interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do pentesting I</font>

270
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,709
said we do social engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

271
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">love to come into your social</font>

272
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:53,469
engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> siab you know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could talk</font>

273
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:56,079
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll do for free and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

274
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,050
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I go but you're going to stand</font>

275
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,449
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole whoever gets social</font>

276
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,060
engineered<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to fire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

277
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:08,260
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go so that means if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i get you</font>

278
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to resign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> correct and he</font>

279
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,420
just walked away and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard back</font>

280
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,970
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know we really gotta get</font>

281
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,760
away from this now while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was doing</font>

282
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,640
some of

283
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,640
this study<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's amazing because</font>

284
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a whole field right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

285
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,790
talking about emotions and there's some

286
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:31,550
some breakthrough issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

287
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:34,189
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> post-traumatic stress syndrome of</font>

288
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:37,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">their actually even seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of</font>

289
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,860
that is we learn it and we have certain

290
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,350
diseases because we've learned it and

291
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,380
because of our emotions<font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman by the</font>

292
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,170
name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> n</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Antonio Damasio and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry</font>

293
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:51,620
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm mispronouncing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his name he got</font>

294
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:57,500
into this kind of in a weird way he

295
00:13:51,620 --> 00:14:00,830
deals with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trauma victims</font>

296
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,820
he's a brain surgeon<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the</font>

297
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:08,360
things he started noticing<font color="#CCCCCC"> was he would</font>

298
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:12,830
have patients that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have frontal lobe</font>

299
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,950
ille<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage now your front lobe is where</font>

300
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:19,610
your emotions<font color="#CCCCCC"> were religion and all that</font>

301
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,980
comes comes to play and what he noticed

302
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:25,490
was people that had no function here

303
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">could not make decisions now it's not</font>

304
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,550
like what do you want to do with your

305
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,209
life

306
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:35,810
it was like here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exact diet</font>

307
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:40,190
cokes<font color="#CCCCCC"> which one do you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

308
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:42,260
could not make a decision at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

309
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,680
he started going through in and he

310
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:52,220
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> realizing that every single</font>

311
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:54,829
decision you make in your life has an

312
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,200
emotional aspect to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we probably</font>

313
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,930
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you bought a house</font>

314
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you bought a car you know I go out</font>

315
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:06,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">and buy toys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guitar stuff like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

316
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:09,140
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rationalize it by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the</font>

317
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,040
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go well do I want it I want it</font>

318
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:17,750
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grab it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but from a just</font>

319
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:20,599
minut<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues are my new decisions we may</font>

320
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:24,740
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still have an emotional</font>

321
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,860
emotional aspect to it

322
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,110
so what does that tell us if we're

323
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,980
dealing with social engineering

324
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">every single decision every single</font>

325
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:41,240
aspect of your human<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

326
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,360
organization or as you has a

327
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:50,060
vulnerability or exposure to be social

328
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:54,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who here has never been social</font>

329
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,910
engineered<font color="#CCCCCC"> good I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glad to see that</font>

330
00:15:54,019 --> 00:16:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's usually always one in every</font>

331
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:04,370
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like time put on your</font>

332
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,690
freaking hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so as we go</font>

333
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,079
around this now

334
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:11,180
so what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll look</font>

335
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit about just what are some of</font>

336
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:16,189
the ways we can kind of get around this

337
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,170
and then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in how can we use this to</font>

338
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:22,700
our advantage to social engineer because

339
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:25,579
really understanding this is great but

340
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,670
what are just some of the little my new

341
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:31,699
things that we could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font>

342
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:35,540
get in there and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of had a</font>

343
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:38,899
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> epiphany a couple months ago and</font>

344
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll talk about how we get past this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

345
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:46,640
let's talk a little bit about fishing

346
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:48,890
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> my experience with social</font>

347
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,459
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> really comes back to my</font>

348
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:55,519
childhood<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a cop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> police officer</font>

middle child<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I had to learn too high</font>

352
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:08,480
a lot because I was a bad kid<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my</font>

353
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:11,720
parents are proud of me now when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say</font>

354
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but by had quite a bit of issues</font>

355
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,669
growing up and in really social

356
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:18,290
engineering is a skill<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you could</font>

357
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:20,059
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason you can talk to some of</font>

358
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:24,290
these other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

359
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:26,178
someone has a gun like this and you have

360
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,850
to talk your way out of it

361
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:31,790
it's a bit of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> skill set so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we</font>

362
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:34,730
get past some of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> defenses you've</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phishing websites</font>

381
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,720
when we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the paper minute to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

fake

386
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:46,669
what made you realize that the file the

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,889
URL

388
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:53,090
yeah that's good you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> your injuries</font>

389
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to see that maybe maybe not</font>

390
00:18:53,090 --> 00:19:01,939
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three domains here which one</font>

391
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,590
of these is faith and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

392
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,140
bottom one that was supposed to say

entry LS it kinda looks like entrails

394
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">which is kind of the guts of animal</font>

00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:51,879
there is a vulnerability or a flaw in

the logic of the protocol of<font color="#E5E5E5"> smtp which</font>

will allow me to send an email from the

let me show you exactly how we do it

470
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,690
when you connect to a mail server<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

471
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,030
say hello

told you say hello

474
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,900
afterwards you say who the emails from

475
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,930
now we all know that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm trying to</font>

00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,730
send something to say parameter<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I say</font>

portion of it

492
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,180
that's what outlook is going to actually

client is going to show and we should

495
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,370
know that this is the case because most

496
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:30,159
of our companies use mass marketing

stop trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to enlighten our</font>

619

621
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:58,110
you think about it in and this is one of

622
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:02,220
those areas i was actually emailing

623
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:06,870
people because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was trying to figure</font>

out our habits emotions<font color="#CCCCCC"> or our habits</font>

out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that and but I kind of</font>

627
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,250
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they fall more on the emotion</font>

628
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:24,990
side kind of right in the middle there

629
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:27,419
because most habits you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

630
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:30,360
have to logically think about you just

631
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:33,480
do and has anybody ever had a habit that

632
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe once they don't do it they really</font>

633
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,520
have emotional<font color="#E5E5E5"> backlash about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

638
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:56,250

764
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,510
one of those areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

765
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,540
important

<font color="#E5E5E5">have good policy and without good people</font>

not because we're stupid

775
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:54,250
we as an industry need to stop that

776
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:56,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">because as an industry it number one</font>

makes us look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we would say in</font>

780
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,290
people and you know what's the big deal
