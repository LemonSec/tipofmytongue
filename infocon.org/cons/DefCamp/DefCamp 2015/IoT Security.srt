1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:07,978
everyone we are going to be speaking
about I would you security and what

2
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:13,010
about us we are both members of black a
cruise ship to you as you can see by our

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:22,080
pool and also week of owners startup
called a room so what they are a team

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,698
maybe it's the insecurity of things or
maybe it's the internet off threats as

5
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:36,309
we can see you later these things have
some tools but their team is of course

6
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:41,899
is the interest of things around

7
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:49,309
of connection and whys that has on and
off switch to the internet so we can be

8
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:56,030
coffee maker washing machines so far as
many many other devices utilize goes on

9
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:04,769
and off switch that chances I can be
part of our team has unleashed from

10
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:15,430
governor says there are over five
furlongs smart devices now account grows

11
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:28,500
so over 15 years we will have 48 belongs
devices connected so what's the problem

12
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,619
with the security problem

13
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,420
cesium

14
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:45,820
almost all their tea prices so sharply
described most common vulnerabilities

15
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:53,288
recently founded I would you raises the
first one is predictable credentials or

16
00:01:53,289 --> 00:02:00,740
default credentials for example some
belkin wireless devices has has been

17
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:09,679
based on market is so they can predict
as it connects to device and as example

18
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,989
about Tsukasa home to my home controller
which has such as age gauges which

19
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:26,510
started in immutable do is memorize all
this case for all kinds of devices so if

20
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:35,209
I can extract this case just Kidz from
one device you can use it for any advice

21
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:46,000
of the next one is access to private for
example smart watches TomTom has

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,600
interesting feature of reading and
listening and also rising piles overused

23
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:03,329
be so there's no guarantee you when you
buy these watches that anyone that where

24
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:14,989
is unmodified so someone can modify
trauma and use it for his goals

25
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:21,330
next is also about

26
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:31,060
Tsukasa smart home controller which can
be controlled by over HTTP so it runs

27
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:41,550
HTTP Server them as a problem is it is
preserving is misconfigured so you can

28
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:51,280
least miles from this device and found
the root password and connect or is this

29
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:02,459
age with israel also because of smart
devices sometimes needs to sound

30
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:11,500
sensible data to the cloud to all these
other devices these data should be

31
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,070
protected so devices should use the
cryptography but it's a problem that

32
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:27,159
these devices has low computational
power so strong cryptography use a job

33
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:36,810
using of Pakistan Republic is impossible
so developers use their homemade

34
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:50,940
threesome and sore with constant gamma
which is bad and so on their own actions

35
00:04:50,940 --> 00:05:01,660
and yes we're so smart devices are
willing and why it's all goes there are

36
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:12,270
there are over 500 windows and a lot of
difference platform center architectures

37
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:12,810
and

38
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:36,220
other things that you can see on this
flight so why should we care so altered

39
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:45,630
models depend so how we call our
Internet device connects to the field

40
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:54,479
can be analyzed using Internet directly
or indirectly it can be accessible only

41
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:02,300
from internet or it can use to lure
little sent work so let's look at the

42
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:13,150
picture as a standard network takeovers
this attack a direct connection to the

43
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:24,140
Internet of Things device so it can be
done via internet if it's even have to

44
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:32,719
think device is public IP so he can take
you from the internet also you can

45
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:43,039
attack it using to lure or Bluetooth and
work another day katherine is can

46
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:56,260
somehow make connections between devices
with ground in such case at exit devices

47
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:07,740
compromise and then he can even take
your PC also we can see this attack he

48
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:15,740
can physically attack your PC and for
example the cross-site request forgery

49
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:25,000
Lee then attacks devices and other
takers can be just your guests who is in

50
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:39,349
your home at work and he joins us so we
can defend you can use either host based

51
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:45,590
intrusion prevention system or network
based intrusion prevention system

52
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:52,760
was based intrusion prevention system
almost impossible because intervene

53
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,990
device almost low-power a lot of
different software vendors different

54
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:07,070
directions and other problems as
majority of the night of devices to care

55
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:15,520
for any alleged my very few to run
something to eat so moralistic he's to

56
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:24,130
use network-based IPS but we still have
some problems with it cause there is a

57
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:38,429
lot of devices have a lot of protocols
say they really different so we need to

58
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:48,370
go to this means high-cost Cabrera
totaled all this traffic also came to

59
00:08:48,370 --> 00:09:01,050
help us against all the attacks for
example it can use some

60
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:11,290
only from some standard or well-known
ethics the using realistic is limited

61
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:20,599
the same problem with its area of nice
our device prob

62
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:28,600
should be good and also network based
GPS don't have any protection portfolio

63
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:36,350
and Bluetooth devices for different
reasons so many existing solutions we

64
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:44,250
have four devices in the internet one
device on the market and all devices can

65
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:55,690
cope against every day every attack us
so how most of these devices works soles

66
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:05,310
stands here between our home network and
service provider and protects you

67
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:13,819
against this attack and the passion
against this attack but we still have

68
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:22,130
problems severe attack from our internal
local network and from attacker who

69
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:35,420
tries to compromise your device using
data connection so comparison of QS

70
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:47,589
devices as you can see soldiers about
foster beer but this is much better so

71
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:55,690
you can see him as the price of all the
devices

72
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:12,020
about $300 only suture a bit lower costs
and so is also been see that show the

73
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:23,069
talks have some questions it's because
45 last month's very website of shield

74
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:29,610
is not accessible and only on what side
of talks you can find a reference to

75
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:35,640
actual device and there is only a few
information its picture it's about on to

76
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:48,260
order its price and that's all so one
more about human we have all the device

77
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:58,880
but it was about six months ago i said
im and we still don't have feet not all

78
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:09,150
industries stop asking to our questions
by email hope you all get someone who

79
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:17,100
also works by BitDefender it's only
device that is already has released its

80
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:28,760
a bit smaller when winter but it's
enough for almost 20 home networks so

81
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,220
how can we make a protection better all
the majority of these devices stands

82
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,230
here but if we will put it we will make
a better protection for example we can

83
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:48,060
protect against taken from internal
network or from

84
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:59,380
shelves used which go away because it
protects only Internet devices not home

85
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:12,360
at work so we tried to make a device
will solve certain we will stand here

86
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:21,150
and so the majority of networks it's not
working device we are still working on

87
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:28,500
it and it's what we want to see in our
device hope someone will make all of

88
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,180
these pills to its stance and local and
work with because we want to protect

89
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:45,479
against hackers so it should be a local
networks it also should separate PC

90
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,960
devices and better things devices cause
there can be a lot of PCs in your

91
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:01,750
network it can generate a lot of traffic
and it's much easier to filter traffic

92
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:10,410
of all Internet of Things devices so in
other options is to split every nothing

93
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:18,120
devices separate because in most cases
racial communicating each other and when

94
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,380
for example your toaster ask your
refrigerator solving it seems strange

95
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,810
cuz shouldn't communicate also

96
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:38,150
its usage of signatures and should reach
to call me for those devices it you can

97
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:45,529
have your network because it's obvious
you shouldn't no less traffic for

98
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:53,130
example Samsung SmartTV future of all
the Philips lamp smarter and of course

99
00:14:53,130 --> 00:15:11,470
we hope it will evaporate to design and
cold war type so it's just said it's not

100
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:30,110
it's not ready for release its just
research state to do so there is some

101
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:48,649
devices its securities disabled yeah
it's an example to attack bill came

102
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:58,379
ministrations recent comments and
injection in it so we try to ya so

103
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:11,220
almost nothing ok so just tell you there
is a section now we have been exploited

104
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,579
to close protection is disabled

105
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:39,769
what is necessary or not but also to
redeem its listing files so we our

106
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:57,819
device which is a local network just
ahead and enabling security status

107
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:09,658
run explode again and it blocks
connection so about an exception

108
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:19,480
everything but for exploit but good for
us and over here is strong as it was a

109
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:38,929
tax attempt

110
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:49,460
so inclusion interpreting commander
still don't care about security lot now

111
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:57,429
it's much better but still some of these
problems and something devices

112
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:06,710
director travel so it's really hard to
find in the real world but another thing

113
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,559
devices

114
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:14,789
it's easy to find there is no protection
for saludo and Bluetooth networks at all

115
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:20,490
for different reasons for example in
russia it's impossible to sell saludable

116
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:29,259
talk to lure or sport closest points
without license and even if you have

117
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:39,369
this license so it's like a story it's
really hard to make sacrifices so this

118
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:46,209
existing devices don't protect from
total taker and this is the reason why

119
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:54,259
existing protection can help you so now
it's like from his book

120
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:59,450
assistance of the wrong person cancel
those persons ourselves so protective

121
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:09,010
devices will self defense operations

122
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:22,510
no questions

123
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:35,920
so the device uses violence to separate
segments different networks yeah that'll

124
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,340
produce device how does this affect
their ability to communicate with each

125
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,899
other do then have to like setup port
forwarding for each of them if I want to

126
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:52,870
stream to my 50 years said we don't care
for this device and it's it's the

127
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:58,959
problems that we can see it's some ways
of solving these problems but of course

128
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:07,500
if we have different each other devices
in his own fuel n then it's impossible

129
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:16,120
Singh said stream video from your phone
to my ear is a possible word maybe it's

130
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:24,729
possible to a future for example you
have some application form you just tell

131
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:33,070
them ok I want to communicate with these
days about an hour and joy in 10 maybe

132
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:40,950
its solution of what you said to use any
ideas ideas solution on it like open

133
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:48,340
source snorter or anything like that we
tried to use but it's clear some

134
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:57,199
disadvantages now we try to find
something better so the hardware is not

135
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,390
powerful enough to actually to get
inspection

136
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,760
it's a real problem to full
participation especially problem when

137
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:13,870
you try to inspect pls terrific you
should I men's and needles connection

138
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,899
not good in all cases what kind of CPU
did you try water

139
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:40,540
SOC what would you use I don't remember
I don't work with small but its website

140
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:46,649
architecture well because there are some
some sort of like

141
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:53,320
tips at Old Navy which are specially
designed for doing back in action and

142
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:03,689
handling tests like this rather than
other local resources you try to find

143
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:12,050
good configuration yeah thanks for all
the talk is interesting I think

144
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:17,169
everybody wants to do these devices or
to have these but I have two questions

145
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:24,600
one is simple I mean he is your project
open source of hard work did you upload

146
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,889
it somewhere and somebody just don't
know they put it in a vehicle machine to

147
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:34,040
just try to find bugs in your web
interface or just make sure about the

148
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:40,909
whole pre-trial be partially open source
so some part of this project will be

149
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,350
open source to another part will be lost

150
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:53,810
ok many projects do I say the second
question actually i think is how I I can

151
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:59,669
clearly see many of us will receive a
limitation so blue to cellular networks

152
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,980
inspection

153
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:07,500
like supporting this kind of devices not
even mentioning all over mesh networks

154
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,580
and proprietary radio frequency
protocols devices you would never think

155
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:18,720
are communicating radio frequency so how
do you see but vendors and yourself

156
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,370
would be able to address with a mean
like if rather frequency protocols or

157
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:31,219
not necessarily frequency how your
device who's gonna handle this Bluetooth

158
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,309
cell or you know we don't to going to
protect saludo or Bluetooth network

159
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:46,418
cause it's it's country-specific to
protect salon at work and we don't have

160
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:53,950
any ideas to securely protect your
Bluetooth device cause you don't want to

161
00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:01,429
bring something resumed its over think
so maybe it's just every person should

162
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:08,220
channel if you don't use it some quizzes

163
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,870
basically means for example you have a
mesh networks imagine Ben s Google nest

164
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,070
and all these

165
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,710
sea-based mesh network of networks which
are like

166
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:26,620
you you know the protocol and all these
other base metals which are created at

167
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:33,090
home and they can use additional layers
of how you are going to solve this

168
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,750
communication device have to communicate
with you cannot even remember my and

169
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:44,990
some attackers can remotely try to
eavesdrop or inject it into both like

170
00:24:44,990 --> 00:25:08,039
back at the end of a tax write yes

171
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:18,429
is not to use force of other vendors as
well as a question if you think about

172
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:19,740
that

173
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:43,179
thank you thank you
