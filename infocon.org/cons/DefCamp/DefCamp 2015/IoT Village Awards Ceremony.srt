1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,189
thank you so much for joining again so
right now will have the worst hermana

2
00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:07,749
variety village and I will let J

3
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:10,940
speaking

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,049
hello everybody

5
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:24,880
yes it's nice to see so many people in
one room is awesome

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,168
grouping over here very nice so the IP
village where I'm not gonna lie to your

7
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:38,269
much better than expected so next year
we're gonna come with a lot more devices

8
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:44,989
and a lot more room most of the time the
space was filled 100% and that also

9
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:50,980
there were some cases some moments like
to overclock or midnight were it was

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:01:00,909
real just wants it that was probably on
other people tried the big spider

11
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:09,020
the biggest price of the mall was the
first one to get hard in 15 minutes and

12
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:16,509
then the Chinese doorbell so the
criteria for selection the way we picked

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,630
up the equipment was something that's a
low-hanging fruit that has a known

14
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,229
vulnerability that's not reveal to
exploit not just point and click you

15
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,500
have to actually spend more than one
minute to do it and that was the

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,909
replicator ok then

17
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:45,649
something that was wrong to have bugs
Chinese doorbell smart adorable bought

18
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:54,280
off ebay that absolutely nobody knew
nothing about so Chinese whole weekend

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,569
all sympathize with that

20
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:02,520
sure an undocumented there's not even
manufacturer website right to find any

21
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:10,590
kind of reference whatsoever so this was
happening like four hours three hours

22
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,720
something about then there's the nest
cam actually the next one is democracy

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,799
Kolkata and we patched it so it's fully
updated and that was supposed to be a

24
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:28,250
challenge for everyone to actually come
with a zero-day exploit or some sort of

25
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,030
her ability that was not found or
disclose the removal was not revealed to

26
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,019
find and that's still being worked on

27
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:39,620
because you can see it's not here on the
stage with me and a nest camp which is

28
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:46,870
still broadcasting really nobody managed
to hack it yet so the city a city of

29
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:55,280
guys if you want they're still up until
five o'clock so when the left closes

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,079
then we're going to take whatever is
left with us home but if you can find

31
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,900
something in either the mikrotik or the
nest cam then they're still up for grabs

32
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:11,810
now it is my great pleasure to invite
the guy that want that we could wait

33
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:18,420
months so I D Alex and nature

34
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:33,049
ok so I did you order because 15 minutes
thank you my name is Adrian I really

35
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:39,530
like routers the first thing I do when I
buy a wireless router is I change the

36
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:47,709
firm or because I don't trust software
that I cannot control and for this one

37
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:58,819
daughter had her former that was bought
with the former wasn't upgraded the

38
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:08,060
firmware was one year old and first
results on Google was how to hack it was

39
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:21,399
an attack on a home network automation
protocol which lets you do on on

40
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:28,739
authenticated command 28 that you just
simply run telnet on it without

41
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,970
credentials so we got to hang out on a
date with Drew taxes so that was the

42
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,229
first time the second step was to kind
of brute force to the file system in

43
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:51,520
order to find the admin password I got
to detour just accidentally I managed to

44
00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:02,140
put it into factory default by accident
and then after they get back I for some

45
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,729
more and I found

46
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:11,370
admin password in clear text on the file
system so that was basically today we

47
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,860
upgraded the firmware to but operation
and their vulnerabilities fixed so

48
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:30,039
remember to go home and upgrade your
former two ureters

49
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,289
remote command execution and passwords
stored in plain text and a lot of other

50
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:42,449
horrible stuff on the file system so the
Chinese doorbell it's actually pretty

51
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,289
cool you know it talks to your phone and
you can see on your phone who's at the

52
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,120
door and can talk to them and you can
push the button

53
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,990
what was the police ring doorbell later
I saw it it has a very poor English you

54
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:03,699
know the Chinese doorbell doesn't speak
English very well so ok so congrats guys

55
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:11,209
the last few words

56
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:23,449
accusation in a vendor a backdoor on it
and basically that will I guess where

57
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:30,830
the way in and was the Android app that
is provided to the no no not a lot of

58
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:38,109
300 but he gives going to publish the
details of this wasn't known

59
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:44,149
vulnerability this is not an envelope we
did find they did find the vendor back

60
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:48,830
door on it I'm gonna buy another one
just just to confirm that all the

61
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:55,459
doorbells made by these manufacturers
are vulnerable to the same thing I need

62
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:00,749
to find a manufacturer in order to the
responsible disclosure and you guys did

63
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:05,610
you like this you guys did blind remote
remote command execution it was actually

64
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,100
pretty trivial ok so it just it was a
matter of finding the right

65
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,030
comment to write command ok I think
that's it

66
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,150
if anybody has any questions feel free
to ask otherwise the devices are still

67
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:26,020
up for grabs of democratic is still the
best camera still there in broadcasting

68
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,130
and we've made the password available so
we have access to democratic admin

69
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:38,280
interface and have access to the nest
cam account so good luck if you if you

70
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,450
feel up to it questions no yes thank you
all
