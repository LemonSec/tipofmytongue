1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,890
we will have a stage as one unit school
who is it just how to mess with under it

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:20,640
England's

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,810
so I hope you are the design
presentation because it was a little bit

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:36,309
something happen in a schedule so thank
everyone for coming today I'm going to

5
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:44,379
resent you an open source project we
have developed this project for about

6
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:50,970
three or four months so it's pretty
young and the message of the whole

7
00:00:50,970 --> 00:01:00,789
presentation is please come up with some
opinions on how to cede whole being

8
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,699
proved actually so we are requesting
some feedback from your we are asking

9
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,880
you to provide us some feedback and
ideas how can this project will be

10
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:31,070
improved

11
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:38,869
there so my presentation is called how
to mess with Android intense I'm just go

12
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:47,750
together with Christina school we have
developed this store and read the

13
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:54,300
intense are one of the important ways
how components inside Android

14
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,899
communicate so this is a part of
inter-process communication actually

15
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:09,170
none read here we are so once again this
is me hear somebody patients I'm

16
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:16,260
education takers quest player and her
own words

17
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:25,399
now today's agenda I will focus on three
main points are modulation some existing

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,480
solutions which we have researched
before so to say and our our project

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:46,750
first our motivation well how many of
you are using an Android phone and for

20
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,829
how many of you

21
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:57,440
securities important things so that's
why we have come with these open source

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,420
project we wanted to address one issue
not all the times and reading times are

23
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:17,220
sanitized and a way how to test this is
to stretch them or to visit them and

24
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,709
this way you can check if hundred
components actually underneath

25
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,579
applications can handle my foreign
intense mulford messages or just a

26
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:37,010
little bit of research we have done
before we start our project it's a paper

27
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,609
golden father crafting in terms of their

28
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,580
they have found some crazies in native
code for top apps like Facebook What's

29
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,200
Up babe I think and this was one on the
search seize power projects so to say I

30
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,780
mean we we got some ideas from them then
another project is this droid Pfizer 400

31
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:12,000
UPS within their tag this is a research
paper written by some students and PhD

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,510
students Sumerian China I'm doing wrong
and unfortunately their project is not

33
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,640
publicly disclosed source I have tried
to bring the source code by this said

34
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:30,430
that they don't collaborate with us so
we were on our own said the same another

35
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,840
another project is this in turn fighting
project some guy quote the US has tried

36
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,130
to develop a more dual core drug user

37
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,719
closer for those who don't know it's a
framework for assessing security

38
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,610
vulnerabilities and read we're going to
discuss about it a little bit late there

39
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:04,680
and we gonna strains of these word that
they were interested only in

40
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,240
broadcasting tents and basically they
have just hard coded things there and

41
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,870
they didn't do too much fighting they
just send broadcasting things within

42
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,610
Android applications this is how the
architecture of this model looks like

43
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:31,340
and looks complicated and now we have
come with our solution to make something

44
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:41,020
very simple easy to use and easy to
integrate with drug user

45
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,810
those are pretty much the steps when we
are discussing about internal fighting

46
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,380
so we extract

47
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:57,360
information from our appt we generate
interns we find them and we send them to

48
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:06,270
to the back to the application we
executives sentence this is how it looks

49
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:13,169
like the interface basically you have a
client on the device under test and the

50
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:21,210
server on your Linux machine during
their communicates through a port by the

51
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:28,810
forties 314 15 that's why you have to
forward first the TCP port to this value

52
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:38,050
and then you can communicate with the
user fees are the commands in order to

53
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,570
use a specific module so if you're
developing your own model Ford roser

54
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:51,000
just put it on a pass and then issue
that command was reported in table and

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:02,210
then you will have your own brother
module inside roser this is how the main

56
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,000
class looks like for our project here
are some options you may pass to our

57
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,830
interns for you know we can you you have
to pass the package name you want to the

58
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:28,900
majors all the packages inside the
device you may send either broadcasting

59
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:37,830
things or facing intense basically those
intense have like six parameters and you

60
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:49,219
can choose between by using specific
parameters or all of them of course if

61
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,670
you want two fires a lot of in time zone

62
00:07:52,670 --> 00:08:01,860
for an application may be some crash
occurred and it's very good to use this

63
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,810
option

64
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,430
save state just not to be put in this
situation that you have to rerun the

65
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:14,250
whole situation again by saving the
state then you can reloaded exactly from

66
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,350
it remains of course you have to specify
the device if you are testing on

67
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:28,000
multiple devices you specify the
DeviceID and we have also performed a

68
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,880
duet of serious attack against the
activity manager running these normal

69
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:42,950
this is how the architecture looks like
you have the device under test running

70
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:51,020
the dozer gland and is collecting for
his deformations and then you can issue

71
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,270
you can't really actually any option you
want and in the end you will obtain some

72
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:06,560
logs some seed fires those seen fires
are very useful if you want to see which

73
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:17,229
dragged we choose trace led to a crash
and if you want to make the device to be

74
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,340
in the same state as it was before
crashing

75
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:32,290
those are the whole options and their
dependencies if you have a seat file you

76
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,469
can run the same seat file again to
replace the application has been fixed

77
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,580
for example so you find a bug then your
budget and then you re-run the seed file

78
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:51,430
just to see if the page was actually
fixing your problem or not

79
00:09:51,430 --> 00:10:01,199
those are some examples of how can you
run this module you can read outside

80
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,730
rosary simply by issuing a minor see and
then the command this is very good

81
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,899
because maybe you want to automate
things you don't want to be inside

82
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:18,860
rosary and types of many commands you
can do a script and you can trigger

83
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:28,709
these commands actually outside rose our
client this is how you run a seat file

84
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:35,430
this is how to run a complete with
reloads day so we have five parameters

85
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,989
which we save for example if you want to
be lowered from the state you simply

86
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:49,890
both those values to this parameter
regarding our results we were able to

87
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:59,850
find a lot of john pointed exceptions
estate secured exemptions and so on and

88
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,459
as I said before we have performed the
denial of service attack against the

89
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:11,189
activity manager actually exactly during
the analysis said thank you wanted to

90
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:19,990
try to open it will shut down
automatically

91
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:27,959
this is our project we were uploading or
projects right here this is our QR code

92
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,839
which leads you to this club so don't be
afraid to scan it in Georgia told you

93
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,560
yesterday that might be dangerous

94
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:43,079
no this is not going to upload also this
project and make it open source on 2012

95
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:50,360
oric which is the Intel hub so you can
see all the open source projects Intel

96
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:59,010
developers have published 22 the
community I have also recorded record of

97
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:10,060
origin of serious attack this is how
does intent of internal looks like for

98
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:21,689
example here we have the extra value
parameter fast and here we have the day

99
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:28,209
you are a feisty as barometers and of
course we can reload as I said before

100
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:34,180
from any state we we want so if any
crash occurred in the meantime we can

101
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:41,239
save the state and reload from that
state for the road now I'm going to show

102
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:56,870
you how did the denial of service attack
looked like it was performed

103
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:16,510
Nexus device Nexus tablet like two days
ago so it has marshmallow and it is only

104
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:23,210
three minutes so don't worry so we have
here the device I have used this visor

105
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:34,270
because you can see the device in the
same time with your screen so it's a

106
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:41,069
chrome plugin actually

107
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:59,720
the device screen

108
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:07,730
now I started to drizzle gland yeah I
mean the server to listen on port 314

109
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:19,459
154 this matter I have to forward for
his the TCP port for ADB to communicate

110
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:27,378
with Mike land

111
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:37,569
and this is how console looks like you
can type comments like Ellis help run

112
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:43,368
and so on this is a whole list of
moderates you have by the fight and here

113
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:52,989
is our module installed inside rosary
I'm going to your package least list all

114
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:58,689
the news and I will filter by militants
I'm just using this package for my line

115
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:05,519
of service attack is really important
not to have an activity which pops up if

116
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:14,660
you want to succeed

117
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:29,819
by issuing hope you can see the whole
options you you can use for any module

118
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:48,970
and for the democracies will use the
denial of service attack

119
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:58,689
the name of the module package name and
then she said that and you buy sexually

120
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:03,509
how many times do you want to be sent to
the device in order for for these

121
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:14,089
deleterious attack and this is what
happens on the screen of the device is

122
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:22,730
not a military so you should try to open
any it will shut down some of them are

123
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:34,410
shutting down very quickly some of them
are thinking yes so he's was pretty much

124
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:40,920
my presentation I want to thank my open
source security team for supporting me

125
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:49,810
for supporting us and if you have any
questions I'm here to answer them
