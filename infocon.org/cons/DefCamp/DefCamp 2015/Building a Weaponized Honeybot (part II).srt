4
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,828

and we ought to Romania right everyone

8
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:55,360
can see this clearly moved to this and
we're not using any to affect clear on

9
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:10,850
the same page

10
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:35,390

11
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,910

12
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:46,760
and that's trying and right now we're
delighted states right so I'm using tour

13
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,600
right now and as their isolation we were
trying to do my eyes recalling attack

14
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,620
right in my presentation so let's check
HERE also to make sure that we are

15
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:15,530
running toward and yes we're running as
you can see so let's have a look

16
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:22,330
so action as you can see we have the
country you have the city we have the

17
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,520
coordinates we have the Java version of
Flash version the screen resolution

18
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:37,209
which mostly used to to track users or
users behind boxes as you can see here

19
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:53,450
cancer can

20
00:03:53,450 --> 00:04:03,410
as the same IP address anyway so I know
still using to of course I had to remove

21
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,840
some of this cold because it was found
them not just like presentation friendly

22
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,970
so I had to remove some of them can also
type of machine so how to disable the

23
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:19,570
attack engine but as you can see here
pretty much weaknesses and utilize the

24
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,200
user but his location got his job
abrasion flash version

25
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,669
everything and we can like like any to
exploit toolkit you can just like for

26
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,799
them expose on the fly on his machine so
thank you so much
