find the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all good guys</font>

145
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,169
here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're attempting to find the</font>

146
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:12,660
other guys right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like you see there</font>

147
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,570
you can use signature file<font color="#E5E5E5"> comparisons</font>

148
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,210
you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> anomaly detection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do</font>

150
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:24,210
all sorts of stuff on the traffic that

151
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:27,450
you capture and this only works at a

152
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:30,599
network level so this is before that

153
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,940
traffic hits the hosts in the network

154
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you've got the other side of things</font>

155
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:38,340
which is the host intrusion detection

156
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,039
system which goes beyond the basic

157
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,219
firewall and detect changes in the

158
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,350

168
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,800
logging it and possibly sending you an

something about it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to leave</font>

179
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:51,359

the thing is each component of the ids

00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:49,350
there's ways to do that you could affect

if it's blocking legitimate traffic

00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:06,059
that's going to piss off your users

206
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:20,069
up generating a lot of false negatives

208
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,939
that's allowed to pass because the

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the knowledge that were covering</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">by using an ideas</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ok i put the ideas now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of</font>

that was working at it was supposed to

00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:58,509
be working is not working anymore

<font color="#E5E5E5">now did that solve my initial problem</font>

224
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,459
possibly not right it might just have

225
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:10,480
brought in a whole bunch of other

227
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,100
well the thing is with ids is<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,459
if you go above that the default setting

00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:45,069
is just allow all traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

allow everything beyond that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:13,059
deal with a lot of complex stuff that it

247

can attack one of these components and

252
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,750
you can cause it to use a lot of memory

253
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:31,420
by opening a lot of sessions that it has

300

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,100

a minute

338
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,670
they use all sorts of unusual

some stuff that's different than what

346
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,779
you were expecting

347
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:04,140
how do you deal with it and this varies

348
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:08,730
greatly as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is another</font>

349
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,770
reason why these attacks happen and

350
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,069
these are some of the most common ones

351
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:17,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">it might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not be visible to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

back of the room so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just go through</font>

353
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:24,659
them anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said you will get</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides anyway so there's no need</font>

355
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,540
to

356
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to really attempt to read all of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

357
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:43,470
let's go through some of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in surgeon</font>

358
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:44,490
this is one of the common attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

359
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,270
this works

360
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:50,790
this usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> occurs when the ids is less</font>

361
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:54,660
strict<font color="#E5E5E5"> and processing the packet then</font>

362
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:57,990
the network behind it and it ends up

363
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:04,680
accepting packets that the end system

364
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:07,890
just drops<font color="#E5E5E5"> rejects so there's an example</font>

365
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,850
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data stream and you see that the</font>

366
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:14,310
sequence is<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be reconstructed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

367
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:18,000
you can send packets in a random order

368
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:21,450
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can specify the sequence</font>

369
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,520
inside each packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so both the ids and</font>

370
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,400
the target system have to reconstruct

371
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,280
that out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> packets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they get</font>

372
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you might not know that but if</font>

373
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:37,440
you send packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> 123 in this order they</font>

374
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:42,540
might end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to 31 on the target</font>

375
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:46,050
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks work so the end</font>

376
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:49,770
target has to reconstruct the data out

377
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:52,919
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has received</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what happens</font>

378
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:56,010
here is you can see there's two packets

379
00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:02,700
with the same sequence number that were

380
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:06,360
sent and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accepts the third</font>

381
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:09,150
packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> the later one which over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rights</font>

382
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,030
the data so it sends all of that it

383
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:16,620
sends everything that it receives but it

384
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:19,770
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sees</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ATX a ck so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that this is</font>

385
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:23,639
not an attack it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can just allow this</font>

386
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:25,950
to to pass while the target<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS actually</font>

387
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,360
only accepts the first packet and

388
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:33,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">discards the second one so the the data</font>

389
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,178
that reaches the end target is actually

390
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,450
an attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

391
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:43,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">the opposite of this is called division</font>

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have at least three options to do it</font>

00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:37,570

do that and that usually doesn't happen

563
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:06,370
so you can just go ahead and attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

open up an encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> Channel and hack</font>

637
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:42,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think from nine years ago that allows</font>

638
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,330
you to create some BMP files that

639
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:50,400

the image<font color="#E5E5E5"> now as potential solutions</font>

641
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,770
like I said the part that nobody cares

642
00:31:51,870 --> 00:32:00,360
about one thing that would be useful is

643
00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:03,600
called normalization which tries to make

644
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,780
sure that the traffic that it sees or

645
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,689
processes is similar to what the target

646
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,520
host would see as you saw most of the

647
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,500
issues stem from the fact that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas</font>

648
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,889
processes data in a different way than

649
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:21,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host so the normalization process</font>

650
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:25,980
does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it allows to sort of act as if</font>

651
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,920
you're the OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the target system and</font>

652
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,900
this is like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second part of the</font>

653
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,179
solution you sort of have to find a way

654
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,919
to implement different tcp/ip<font color="#CCCCCC"> stacks</font>

655

<font color="#CCCCCC">inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

657
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:41,789
simulate the stack on the target systems

658
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:43,739
and they have to know well this is a

659
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:46,139
window system this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

660
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:47,609
if this packet goes here<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to process it in a different way</font>

662
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:53,699
than that packet you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get this is usually</font>

663
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:55,859
easier done at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host level instead of</font>

the network level<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there's a bunch of</font>
