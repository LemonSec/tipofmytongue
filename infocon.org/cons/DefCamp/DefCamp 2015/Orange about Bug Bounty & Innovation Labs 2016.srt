1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,498
thank you want the morning so today
we're going to actually to become the

2
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:15,379
first one is actually what I started
yesterday to to explain the bug bounty

3
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:19,830
and the reason or injuries following its
supporting this this program for the

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,290
first time in many operators side on the
left side and the second tote bags it's

5
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,730
about innovation labs and here I wanted
to ask you how many of you are familiar

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:38,230
with innovation ads please raise your
hand so not so many good this means that

7
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:45,489
we have a good topic for today we will
start first with an introduction about

8
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:53,620
let's say the moment in our life and
said the interface is the interactions

9
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,709
with the cybersecurity and here I'm
pretty sure that you are quite aware

10
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,839
about the places in which you are
accessing the public hotspots the wifi

11
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:09,229
which could be public hotspots could be
private hot spots on passports personal

12
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:14,460
hotspots mobile electronic comments it's
a hot topic in which cybersecurity it's

13
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,509
an important enabler then for sure the
public sector and government

14
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:26,799
applications which needs a strong
security mechanism behind the strong

15
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,590
support from all the industry players
then in terms of education

16
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,750
modern education today it's should be
based on

17
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,920
a clear and strict rules in terms of
security and coming to the enterprise to

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,710
go to the business sector you are all
probably familiar people which are

19
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,889
working from multi-national sector from
from companies which are already

20
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,619
introducing all or they introduced the
bring your own devices they have their

21
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:04,440
own assistants I'd probably the
integration with the internet with the

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,609
people which are working remotely so
it's very important to have a secure

23
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,209
connections and the way to to allow the
people to have a mobile working space

24
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:18,739
then for sure these kind of events
conferences special events which needs

25
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,850
to be secured not necessary that we are
here on the difficult should be highly

26
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,930
secure secure and for sure the connected
to the Internet things we saw the

27
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:39,190
contest on the idea village and today
actually intends to approach on

28
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:48,880
designing the security solution it's
very important to assess the volume of

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,690
the data the type of the device is the
type of the technologies the user

30
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:59,459
behaviors that we are what we are facing
in the not only in Romania but also in

31
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,200
the in the world and he just some of the
figures that we are all injured we are

32
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,040
considering in the engineering face when
were designing a product being for the

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,578
security or just for the communication
for a 90 bpm or for the I don't know 40

34
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:17,530
wifi type of the solar solutions so we
are relying on something some secrets

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,590
and here are just a couple of them so
from our statistics 58 percentage of

36
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,390
those cities and areas are using the
internet daily fixed other words in the

37
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:34,410
world's 1.5 billion smartphone users
today and push this will increase for

38
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,570
time more wifi traffic I don't know if
this is probably something that we

39
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,650
expect it or not no more wifi traffics
in the words of similar one still

40
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,140
capture on the way for WiFi part then
something interesting ok

41
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,100
probably you are in this situation
you're going in a retailer in a shopping

42
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,010
mall want to buy something you need to
check some prices to compare the prices

43
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,200
than you are using the hot spots there
and on the company side on the company

44
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,769
level 61 percent of the employees or
should they want the mobile working

45
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,610
working space they want they want the
companies believe that the cloud can

46
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,109
improve their abilities 63% a Saudi
secret sexual important to be considered

47
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,640
in the design phase before to start
building a new PC software security

48
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:30,729
solutions for a security applications in
terms of enterprise sectors what's

49
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:38,850
actually in the first half of this year
we did a survey in Romania on the medium

50
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,210
and large companies and what we found
out is that less than a quarter of the

51
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,840
company's interview believe they face
the cybersecurity risks so this means

52
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,719
that probably there assuming that they
don't have any security but also this is

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,310
on the lower level 30 percent to
unsecured wi-fi network at all 43

54
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,110
minutes kind of traffic for miles 150
percentage they have no application

55
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,140
control systems and going so nobody does

56
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:17,130
protection don't employ two factor
authentication for the VPN connection we

57
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,710
just mentioned about the mobile workers
at all we started already processed to

58
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,260
built with you can call it up

59
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,050
bulletproof solution when the business
internet securities of the companies the

60
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:37,010
contest that we support it in the last
couple of weeks together with the comp

61
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:42,849
was actually meant to increase the
accuracy of the solution being on the

62
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:50,000
harder level on the configuration level
the architectural and this is not all

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,190
so when we're talking about building the
product building and architecture behind

64
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,830
the product behind the services rather
she not only is not only the engineering

65
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,510
mind from the company from orange or
from our partners store yesterday that

66
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,270
with the forty-ninth our partners on the
bhagwan contest but it's also important

67
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:16,190
to to take also some were some feedback
some fresh ideas from the from the young

68
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:22,260
generation in here bringing in the
startup concept and this is the reason

69
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,610
that I asked you initially about the
innovation labs because from innovation

70
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,400
lets which is practically the program
three months but actually the program in

71
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,419
which all in his partner so he's not
managed by orange is managed by take

72
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,549
lunch which is an orange from Romania so
we we we are bringing new ideas fresh

73
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,300
ideas not only on the cybersecurity part
but also on the other businesses like

74
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,750
retail like agriculture like he held so
for us to programs which are important

75
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,040
in this moment for building the product
shooting at the product can become

76
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:01,080
bulletproof intensive security but also
creating new revenue stream for us

77
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,270
innovation let's and the first on or
about twenty is what we already started

78
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,940
with this with this concept is different
and we were really wants to go more and

79
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,610
to have a unique challenges inside this
Orangeburg County program I will

80
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,419
speaking about innovation labs because
I've seen that this is something which

81
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:28,760
is not on your side and then I will try
to mix to about twenty reason what we

82
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,229
are doing and to actually how r
continued innovation labs I mention that

83
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:39,510
it's a dream on startup three months
accelerator which is actually taking an

84
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:45,110
idea and the team of couple of people
from 23 up to five people from one idea

85
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,000
to prototyping and going up to the most
viable program

86
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,360
product which is actually a prototype
that can be tested in real life and

87
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,860
she's the real life it's actually which
the real customers so when when you're

88
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,750
seeing his idea it's ok what they're
bringing in and hear the start of this

89
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:11,090
contest it's it's starting actually with
a hard on which is a 24 hour coding face

90
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,659
exactly like the continent like the
contest that just finished now just that

91
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,300
is for building an idea for put building
a prototype ok then it's about three

92
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,430
months of mentoring and take talks and
therefore should boost day and the

93
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,130
democrat the funeral which investors not
only orange but also the partners from

94
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,409
the program and here you have the three
main partners so to get there with with

95
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:40,159
us in this in this in this program
managed by techcrunch.com food and the

96
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,840
American Foundation there are behind us
there are also other partners like this

97
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,660
year which is also one of the sponsors
today actually we are taking the ideas

98
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,910
and the team that teams which are
producing this we have taken from from

99
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,250
this program we actually we are going to
the mentorship face we are opening our

100
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,450
network infrastructure we are opening
our API so not only what is but also the

101
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:05,620
high-tech partners I mentioned it also
Cisco together with us so we are

102
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,070
bringing also they neighbors with them
and then we are trying to expose this

103
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,210
type of solutions to our customers time
to see the feedback and then to

104
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,260
fine-tune the process and at the end we
can have a successful product or

105
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,120
application that could be integrated in
orange portfolio or other partners

106
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,410
portfolio so in terms of benefits for
the high tech ecosystem or should that

107
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:35,160
one of the reason we are doing this it's
to attract young people interpret state

108
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:46,310
then to try to reach out to how to think
in terms of product in terms of

109
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:52,709
marketing not only in terms of technical
parameters and for sure to bring some

110
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,730
project management skills and experience
this is the reason for the techniques

111
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,520
and for the mentorship programs

112
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,960
and begin to increase the number of
startups things they go system in

113
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,070
Romania because this is a new program
which is i didn't mention before it's

114
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:15,580
not it's because now it's also present
in cluj-napoca and next year

115
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,230
innovation 8060 actually we will be in
the program also in the studio and

116
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:25,630
probably this is the figures and
statistics from this year the program

117
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:34,820
has the choice between 1st of February
and end of May which does start codons

118
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:44,710
to us because we had more than 200
registered participants which former on

119
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:51,940
54 teams they wanted to idea ideas
pitched so thirty teams in the

120
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,470
programming in the three months of the
accelerator programs because before this

121
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,560
accelerated program in the hospital we
had fifty 14th then at the end of the

122
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,260
program will remain which 24 product
24th bet our alpha solutions and product

123
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:15,240
here we have some I will open a movie
just to to see the experience from the

124
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,110
demo day

125
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,570
so the demo day was the end of the
program in which they presented their

126
00:11:24,570 --> 00:14:00,610
solution

127
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:22,709
the program was the scene from different
social networks you can check the

128
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:28,640
programs because the program started
actually 2013 orange joined the program

129
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,790
in 2014

130
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,800
so for the next year preparing for the
third edition ok what is the link

131
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:43,599
actually with security and one of the
team from this year from the last

132
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,640
contest called intelligence proposed
product solution for the company's on

133
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,730
the security side to secure their to
secure their business environment so the

134
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,100
product designed to automatically
discover the critical services and

135
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,810
security friend footprints over the
tyrant

136
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:13,119
administrator actually one of the
founders

137
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
capture the flag

138
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:28,190
I don't know probably and inside the
Innovation Lab this year they got also

139
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:34,199
some finals which they use it to develop
the product to bring anything the last

140
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,719
faced actually the face for the points
at which these parties now there in the

141
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,490
middle of this year if you are
interesting about his experience about

142
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:59,030
the team experience both how they did it
I invited to discuss should be here

143
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:27,930
between the two programs products from
the program

144
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:34,839
innovation labs 2016 what we are
preparing in terms of texts we are we

145
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,840
see that on the health side and on the
lifestyle we need somehow to keep this

146
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:50,690
year then the retail we have to keep
this district attorney Craig Rd culture

147
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,680
way because the one of the part of the
American Foundation is very keen to this

148
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,930
topic and for sure

149
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,569
stable security and behind this what I
mention we are the partners we are

150
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,150
opening our infrastructure we are
supporting in terms of mental ships in

151
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,700
terms of bringing the right

152
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:17,870
districts are willing to take such
solution and to validate the concept so

153
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:27,569
probably the most important factor in
this program that if you're interested

154
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:34,950
you can check this innovation let's open
registration will be beginning probably

155
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,010
beginning of February next year we just
started together with the teasing face

156
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,210
then the hospital because the bill will
be much and they mentioned yeah she's

157
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:55,980
trying to see if we can find a way also
to bring in the techniques with all the

158
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,970
three months of the program is the day
we have the middle of the program

159
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,100
actually what we are looking to the
movies to see the progress of the

160
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,990
solution and some of some of the
participants some of the teams usually

161
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:15,810
are not on the day and then there are
other ideas just to bring the successful

162
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:22,899
product on the demo day which is the
final so what will happen actually we

163
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:29,540
are estimating for the next contestant
9595 teams entering the hospitals in the

164
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,470
tri-cities 495 team's pitching for one
minute

165
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:40,700
beginning of the weekend the morning
then we are judging so it will be a

166
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:47,230
crowd waiting fifty percent of the
points and then jury selection and then

167
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,310
we will remain with 17 switch entering
the 24 hours

168
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,560
gardens at the end of the haircut on
Sunday morning five minutes each time we

169
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:06,590
lived with them and speech at the end we
are estimating to have our own 3414

170
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,949
entering the three-month program going
toward this all the faces that I

171
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,480
mentioned before which are actually
talks with people from industry from

172
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,960
multi-national from entrepreneurs
speaking about marketing about idea

173
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:31,670
about how you can bring a product from
an idea to successful development to

174
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:38,820
successful deployment then we have the
mental ships and attention because they

175
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,919
thought this was with innovation and
send the link with

176
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:52,330
with security environment and security
researcher community not going back to

177
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:59,530
the Orangeburg County which is the
program that will occasionally we

178
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,270
mention I mentioned yesterday the reason
oranges actually sustaining this program

179
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,700
is very important to again to have
multiple guys looking to the solution

180
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:15,220
that we are developing very important to
use the available resources which are

181
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:22,270
part of useful practical research of the
Securities chilled white ethical hackers

182
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:27,980
community and this is one of the reason
that we are standing this for sure that

183
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,549
behind this we are also reinforcing the

184
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:37,529
responsible disclosure in terms of
reliability identification because that

185
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:42,249
is the most important is actually the
difference between doing something good

186
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:49,460
and doing something but we are not alone
in this quest on the world in the words

187
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,210
there are programs in there are two
companies which are you thinking this

188
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:00,110
type of approach this contest and
they're working with hackers and here

189
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:07,840
you have just a few of the companies
probably the online software development

190
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:15,600
and for sure that even today said the
figures are from the corner in the last

191
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,100
night and today this is the situation is
to be 130 programs public programs open

192
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,879
on the bug bounties and if you are doing
the month it's more or less

193
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:36,509
100 bucks discovered that program which
is quite relevant and also the amount of

194
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:41,460
money spent and also the Hall of Fame
which is increasing its increasing and

195
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,309
if you're going on the pages of this
website you can find their own like

196
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:50,320
knowledge meant but wanted knowledge
menteur Monty Hall of Fame you will find

197
00:21:50,320 --> 00:22:01,570
a lot of Romanian probably some of them
are here with us in this room we had two

198
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:09,439
weeks we receive 93 year we had we
ninety five participants were registered

199
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:17,220
15 participants managed to score reports
112 reports received by us and by our

200
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:26,610
partner 4971 validated and this was
based points for the

201
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:36,290
world yesterday we we also had the
ceremony to give the price that the

202
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:44,580
words to three of the top three
contenders and actually my pleasure to

203
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:54,659
invite here the first two units and they
will I asked them to share some feedback

204
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,150
section

205
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:02,299
how did it the reason they participated
to this contest they have some advice

206
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:25,920
for you I will

207
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:45,410
I'm going to share my name is I'm going
to share my experience with ABS County

208
00:23:45,410 --> 00:24:03,430
used to participate in programs like
facebook like I used to play no games

209
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:11,800
today I'm going to to speak about my
motivation how hard it was to find all

210
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:21,629
these security problems give an example
of how I managed to discover this attack

211
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:32,040
and to help to improve the security of
web application firewalls is very

212
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:43,800
important to have the security of this
software vary security another because

213
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,490
I'm a very curious person to see how
things works and Indians to learn

214
00:24:48,490 --> 00:25:06,170
something about that how hard it was so
so that the firewall managed to block

215
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:15,320
very very well they scare injections and
then not so very well-managed like the

216
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:24,010
other ones but they had very good very
good protection and it was really hard

217
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:31,300
to explain their ok so I'll start with
the first example of how I managed to

218
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,590
find

219
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:42,480
excursions I don't know the number I
think it was 56 I don't remember how I

220
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:51,520
managed to find such problems that led
directly to the web applications request

221
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,789
more time

222
00:25:52,789 --> 00:26:02,010
union's web application to find out what
is blocked by the file then some

223
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:13,580
functions are and to find out what is
and what is not

224
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:26,250
and make white least watch what could
help me to develop attacks so the

225
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:33,230
firewall will stop by load as such as
Union all select union select select

226
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:43,020
something from Table one application for
recognize when functions like

227
00:26:43,020 --> 00:27:02,139
would recognize when i when i wud using
were recognized if I try to to command

228
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:16,020
the rest of the payload and i cant use
instead of space newline how I managed

229
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:26,779
to find a try to bypass each problem
like I can use spaces ok so I try to

230
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:33,420
find something that replace replace that
space so I something about

231
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:40,950
obfuscation techniques from a
presentation by Rodriguez and he found

232
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:52,100
that 20 space I use it to make an attack
and it was successfully it works and it

233
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,419
hit the web application so the first
payload I sent was that one on the

234
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:14,070
slight another way to another find a way
to 22 strings like a used car values

235
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:24,550
column like I can be used to replace I
can use to replace the string

236
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:34,430
representation instead of a I would use
Durex 6166 representation of eight so

237
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:45,140
and the comment I used the hashtag to
comment on the rest of the people then I

238
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:55,950
made a list of all skill works with
strings and it was a huge least and

239
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:03,080
operators that it direct into the web
application was the ones from from the

240
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:13,870
flight so they are important to extract
data from the database you can you can

241
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:20,330
use anything from there you can make
combination to extract data from the

242
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:33,360
babies are sleeping so I some things
that I was talking to looking for things

243
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:42,510
that weren't blocked by the Web
Application Firewall I managed to find I

244
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,980
made

245
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:54,910
to to get some event attributes that
that blocked by the fire all and I found

246
00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:04,140
a list of them some of them doesn't help
me because user interaction but some and

247
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:10,890
an example so I used the tag video it
was blocked I managed to find it in the

248
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:23,090
first in the first step here then I use
the event that would like so we'll take

249
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:33,549
the value is very generous with GDM
Japanese in code so what is what is

250
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:44,460
written on the slide is in javascript
and i ended with the server because HTTP

251
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:50,990
with wasn't allowed because it was
blocked by the Federal I think the

252
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:59,419
companies should support these kinds of
initiatives because it helps to improve

253
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:12,350
the software security should take part
they have to learn we should treat all

254
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:18,520
the cases when you blacklisting list of
others liked the firewall should treat

255
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:29,840
all the cases from aspects and I think
the crowd Community College help to

256
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:40,290
improve the security and this kind of
initiative should take read more in our

257
00:31:40,290 --> 00:32:08,168
thank you

258
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:15,009
hello everyone my name is and I have
participated in the contest I have

259
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:21,769
ranked second and they're like to talk
to you about my experience in the

260
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:27,029
contest and what are some of my
recommendation

261
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:35,409
first of all about me I'm 17 and I'm in
the last year of high school in my spare

262
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:41,059
time I like to improve alerting us about
one of my passions heightened security

263
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:53,190
that was the reason why I have
participated in the contest so what was

264
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,409
exactly my experience

265
00:32:55,409 --> 00:33:07,639
well first approach I after a break on
face I found out that there were four

266
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:18,830
platforms outdated which had a lot of
but they were fire world because the

267
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:26,199
rabbit is was kind of easy to find but
the firewall was blocking most of the

268
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:33,629
attacks so we had to bypass the firewall
an interesting thing that I found was

269
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:41,379
that programmers mistakes actually make
it worse for the firewall to block that

270
00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:50,639
tax for example one program note that it
was a good idea to your old according to

271
00:33:50,639 --> 00:34:04,090
put so I could double up a lot and it
would bypass the fire example of my

272
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:12,210
attacks the first one is about getting
access to the server by uploading Russia

273
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:31,210
after trying many things most of the
most of the two like the PHP open tags

274
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:46,830
and we couldn't i couldn't manage to
executed some how else I found that the

275
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:53,399
short tax for PHB were not filled out by
the firewall but there was a problem

276
00:34:53,399 --> 00:35:08,080
firewall config file has said of so we
couldn't execute PHP by using them but I

277
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:17,700
remember about beating that sort out for
PHP a call

278
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:32,629
works even if your taxes are off so we
could basically used this and we could

279
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:38,500
do something that bypass the firewall
that was something like you've all the

280
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:51,020
facts the court of requests and we could
basically do anything from here like for

281
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:59,400
example remote command execution after
uploading the show we could send a

282
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:07,700
request with the likes of a system
command and the command which would be

283
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:13,828
executed as the user

284
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:21,109
another interesting thing that wasn't
fire world was that I could create

285
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:28,900
reversal by using this remote command
execution for example use despite a

286
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:35,799
script of course I could use Perl or
something but this one for me so I was

287
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:51,509
there and we got a reversal interesting
example of an attack this was more

288
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:57,749
creating one because I wanted to do
something creative not so common way to

289
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:02,328
get any type of fire on the server

290
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:15,099
like her or any type of stuff we would
use effect DNS server and give the

291
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:25,160
basics before the matter to the ski
which would of course limit to 65,000

292
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:41,299
bites but we could do this and up and as
many times as we we are the first to our

293
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:51,979
fake penis which Gordon is key which was
a 64 appended to the model and in the

294
00:37:51,979 --> 00:38:00,520
end and there was our final

295
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:22,220
it was charging those things to learn
and this is all the security search or

296
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,899
anyone passionate about security

297
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:34,330
this is a great way to learn meetings
and change your self also I saw that it

298
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:49,750
is very hard to filter everything but at
least we can still there 99.9%

299
00:38:49,750 --> 00:39:02,380
and keep up with new methods in security
also for organizers it's a great way to

300
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:14,830
get a preview for their infrastructure
for the security and to improve it so

301
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:43,470
they would not lose some weight up to
thank you think you know what I didn't

302
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:50,529
mention before is that they are in the
same team and they just finished the

303
00:39:50,530 --> 00:40:03,510
capture the flag for their twenty-four
hours so just take away from this

304
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:11,480
presentation I mention of both orange
Monte the reason we're doing this and we

305
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,710
can we will continue to do this and here
probably will be also in a controlled

306
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,920
environment like this

307
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:26,620
stay tuned check the site and why not
try to think about the leaderboard

308
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,700
joining one of the accelerated programs
innovation and she's not the only one

309
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:41,169
here but I was just presented you'd
think the next program for the 2016 you

310
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:47,360
can check the website then I can give
you more information about this and

311
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,370
we're happy to answer all of your
questions now word during the break

312
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:57,529
thank you

313
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:04,300
questions find out

314
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:16,020
are there any plans for long-term bug
bounty program like the ones Facebook

315
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:26,500
has or has so this is what they tried to
highlight this what we did here are very

316
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:34,170
happy and proud actually we are thinking
also organize that help us with the part

317
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:40,070
of the infrastructure and also partner
fortunate and this is what we are going

318
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:46,200
to be in these moments to have this kind
of program at least two times a year

319
00:41:46,200 --> 00:42:03,649
want probably which the deaf and another
one for me but this is again just the

320
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:10,510
product and the way we have fine-tuning
the configuration before and each time

321
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:18,340
we'll have this kind of upgrade product
will try to put this kind of contesting

322
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:33,780
place I was thinking more in the program
continues its program if you went

323
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:41,830
the contest was more on the behind its
own security what are you asking is if

324
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:46,799
we are doing also these are we willing
to do this social for the project we

325
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,700
will consider today only focusing on the
enterprise this is also linked to the

326
00:42:52,700 --> 00:43:04,430
innovation labs into the start i know im
really impressed with what you did there

327
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:10,640
was there and I'm interested do you have
any international participants in the

328
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,830
program and the vision to incorporate
the nearby countries also in the content

329
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:30,259
or if you prefer to keep it will go
because we have so I'm interested in

330
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:52,630
participating in the open for everybody
and in terms of international audience

331
00:43:52,630 --> 00:44:14,870
what participants other countries going
on English from the additional in from

332
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:24,220
the difficult just that probably was not
before the news when I get back

333
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,240
thank you

334
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:34,899
other questions

335
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:44,589
also going to open up the structure to
the bug bounty and in addition to that

336
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:49,029
the programs are you going to provide

337
00:44:49,029 --> 00:44:56,479
some rewards like all the other players
so what they actually looking in terms

338
00:44:56,479 --> 00:45:00,779
of opening old infrastructure which part
of which because we open it actually

339
00:45:00,779 --> 00:45:05,419
this was a controlled environment it was
not a life traffic was just to test our

340
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:20,129
children to find any of them as long as
you're playing nice daily structure like

341
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:31,159
we are considering this part but all the
infrastructure it's talking about the

342
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:38,169
services because those are probed on a
daily basis by the attackers and then of

343
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:44,949
course our data is on your side we need
to make sure that gives the public as

344
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:50,599
the attackers especially now as we have
a large number of APT groups and that's

345
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:57,979
constantly growing and of course you're
a target so I mention about responsible

346
00:45:57,979 --> 00:46:04,928
disclosure I mentioned we have to do
this in a controlled environment because

347
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:14,959
we we have to know who is behind in
terms of opening old infrastructure or

348
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:18,928
part of the infrastructure we just
started with these analyzing now in

349
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:23,409
which other parts of our network of all
applications systems were all part of

350
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:28,109
the solution that these are working with
us we are thinking where and when to

351
00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:31,538
come with this for sure this will be
properly communicated by US

352
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:38,770
international forwards I mentioned that
yesterday was the ceremony but

353
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:48,330
depending what are you looking at well
that depends on you and say if you want

354
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:52,250
the remote code execution and orange
that are oh well that's going to cost

355
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:59,630
you five thousand or 10,000 and I'm not
talking about Ron but thats this kind of

356
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:07,620
this kind of words with you i mean to
have a place in the hall of fame or

357
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:13,560
acknowledgement is not enough for you
need more highly skilled people in the

358
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,529
idea security segment I don't think
that's enough because they spend their

359
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:26,620
own time discovering the greedy threats
and exploiting your infrastructure so if

360
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,500
you match an apt group that spends
hundreds of thousands of dollars to

361
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,520
attack you and to get our data with how
much do we are somewhere between two

362
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,220
thousand and ten thousand euros per
month well understood your point so we

363
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,910
are here said this is the first time for
us we are learning this this is probably

364
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:53,120
a contest that we plan to be managed in
three months we will consider this for

365
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:58,710
for the next stage and then this is
important also what the third year which

366
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,130
are participating

367
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:06,480
it's a time consumed in the in this
activity is not only in this context of

368
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:15,160
this for sure that we will will consider
thank you for

369
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:25,060
thank you so much thank you
