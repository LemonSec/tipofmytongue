1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
my name is shake work at the scene
security consultant IDT solutions based

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,269
in Dubai in the UAE and one of the key
in a discussion . today's around

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,599
building security operation centers and
the reason why is throughout the last

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,139
two days what we've identified is you
know the cyber threats are going to grow

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,430
and already significantly growing and
targeting different types of systems

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,060
applications across enterprise
environments and one of the key things

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,759
are usually start by Enterprises is
logging and monitoring so the agenda

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,390
that we're going to be discussing is the
need to build an enterprise-wide cyber

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,770
security operations center the
components of the sea stock what we call

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,710
c sub 2 20 and you'll see the reason why
we call it 2-0 the key components of

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,070
building SI saket obviously same
solutions which is security information

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,730
event management a tooth actually
collects all the logs correlates them

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,239
and provide security analytics and
correlation information and also try to

14
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,870
understand specific threat cases that
are within your enterprise environment

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,800
itself the most important thing in
trying to identify an attack breach is

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,188
to basically build early-warning
detection systems within your enterprise

17
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,210
and this is something that we find quite
often specifically in the Middle East

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,949
because it's a hot target you have a lot
of investment within the Middle East

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,720
where for example organizations are
building smart cities everything is from

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,310
the smart devices from smart phones you
can actually you know if you wanted to

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,060
book a train ticket you could do it
through your phones you can pay in a

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,000
meeting and taxis everything can be done
through the front door

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,710
everything is basically being put onto
smart cities environments and within the

24
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,610
middle east building basically a huge
data store of information from IOT

25
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,220
devices senses which you know developers
can then use to create nice applications

26
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,048
so of course the requirement to then do
perform monitoring and reporting becomes

27
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,170
one more important and as part of the
sea stock of course you need to build

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,390
processes procedures in order to
identify exactly how to carry out the

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,189
incident response when an incident does
occur so what are the current challenges

30
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,059
onslaught of security data right so
within an enterprise environment you

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,179
probably have perimeter firewalls you
have a DMC you have application

32
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,810
firewalls intrusion prevention systems
you might have an internal data center

33
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,270
fire

34
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,740
at the end . you might have anti virus
malware protection daily Prevention's

35
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,030
you have a huge number of different
types of devices within your enterprise

36
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,950
environments each one of them generating
huge amount of logs and as a security

37
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,000
analyst who's basically performing
security operations cannot simply

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,630
understand this looks right you need a
tool to be able to correlate them right

39
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,740
and at the same time what we're finding
is that cybersecurity is moving into a

40
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,470
very kind of a precious area because the
the regulations are being enforced by

41
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,740
the government so what we find for
example at least in the region that we

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,010
work in that the government is actually
developing information security

43
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,429
standards and enforcing it onto the
enterprise's so just like for example

44
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,590
you have iso 27001 you have a
country-specific security regulations

45
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,310
that is pushed to the enterprise's of
the government's and the government

46
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,360
federal entities they have to comply to
the security standards and that's the

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,500
only way the organization is going to
invest in security and implement the

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,340
right type of controls so there's a
there's this you know this the dynamics

49
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,570
are changing the other thing also that
we're finding is that the the line

50
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:25,060
between having a breach and legal
matters or legalities within

51
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,040
cybersecurity is also changing so if you
look at for example in the UK if the

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,130
cyber security breach the government has
the right to find an organization for

53
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,320
the negligence of the beach right so I'm
not sure if you guys saw the hacking

54
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,549
attempt that happened in the UK for talk
talk right which wear something like

55
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,720
around four million post API information
was stolen

56
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,609
there's there now under a an
investigation and approximately and

57
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,420
they're going to possibly be fine around
millions of pounds so the point here is

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,619
that legal framework is also changing of
course when you're looking at you know

59
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,110
protecting your organization's it's very
common to find that organizations are in

60
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,250
adequately prepared

61
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,959
why because there's no instant there's
no coordinated incident response

62
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,988
there's no understanding of the assets
that you have with digital assets that

63
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:21,548
you have the system honor the technical
owner who to escalate to and who to

64
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:22,359
respond to

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,170
so typically one of the things we found

66
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,290
and this is a very classic example in
2012

67
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,190
one of the major oil and gas companies
in Saudi was impacted the mouth culture

68
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,060
moon not sure if you if you guys have
heard of the malware but it basically

69
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,250
impacted 40,000 end points within the
organization so first of all the

70
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,370
compromise happened through compromising
privileged access for admittance system

71
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,970
admin for domain controller and then
basically took control of 40,000

72
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,170
machines the malware was then installed
and it and it was a time bomb so

73
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,510
basically it it executed exactly eleven
o'clock on a specific day which

74
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,580
basically removes the Master Boot copy
of the entire endpoints basically making

75
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,930
all the 40,000 machines useless now of
course if you had monitoring controls in

76
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,770
place you could actually be pretty
proactive in understanding what is

77
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,549
happening to environment now that
particular model where was specifically

78
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,500
designed for 32-bit systems now their
servers are running 64-bit architecture

79
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,280
so that's the only reason why the server
is actually survived the attack so we're

80
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,940
saying in the inn at least in the region
that we work in a huge amount of attacks

81
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,410
coming from different organizations
because of you know how active activism

82
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:40,560
activity geopolitical reasons etc right
so there are two approaches in building

83
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,940
a stock you can either in-house it or
you can outsource it right so as an

84
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,469
organization what you can do is you can
build the expertise within your

85
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,850
environment right or you could simply
outsource it to a trusted service

86
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,030
provider but one of the challenges is is
typically you can outsource security but

87
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,830
you cannot outsource your risk right so
so typically what we find is a

88
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,609
successful stock implementation is
usually done within the organization

89
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,080
itself and that it's a separate
organizational department that's

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,950
developed so it doesn't have a reporting
line 2i t it actually has a reporting

91
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,570
line much higher up in the
organizational chart and it has key

92
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,400
teams from the finance department from
the HR department etc and this goes back

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,909
to the point of use education which was
the number about previous session right

94
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,560
social engineering is a very common way
to you know carry out exploits within an

95
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
organization so the sock team is

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,830
only responsible from monitoring your
activities around event logs but also

97
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,750
responsible to educate and raise the
awareness of information security within

98
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,819
the different departments so why do you
need to build the sea stock right it's

99
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,789
designed to be the nuclear so it's the
heart of any organization from a

100
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,330
security point of view right is doing
continuous monitoring continuous

101
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,859
prevention is identifying any attacks or
different locks sources are you know

102
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,940
integrated into your into your system
solutions and of course you can build

103
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,780
computer emergency response teams around
it as well so if there is an incident

104
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,729
you know you know exactly the protocol
to follow to be able to get to be able

105
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:20,310
to remediate right so what are the key
objectives of a sock managing coordinate

106
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,360
the response of cyber threats and
incidents morning to the cyber security

107
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,139
posture and report deficiencies right
performs for under $MONEY billet

108
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,409
assessment so as as mentioned in the
previous presentation we're talking

109
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,949
about patch management patch management
should be applied in the regular basis

110
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:40,349
right whenever this for example in your
vulnerability is disclosed immediately

111
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:44,490
they should be you know a patching cycle
within the day within two days depending

112
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,229
on the criticality now whose
responsibility is it alright so it could

113
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,930
potentially be the responsibility of a
song because they have the ultimate

114
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,800
authority to say we've identified as a
new vulnerability on this particular

115
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,060
system and then informed the system
owners that please make sure that this

116
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,659
system is then patched right so you can
now see the link when it comes to

117
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:07,050
building a security operations center

118
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,860
another important reason why you need to
build a sakis you know remove over the

119
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,880
last two days we've heard about cyber
security breaches hacking attempts or

120
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,380
the nice different models are being
created etc but the most important thing

121
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,599
for enterprise is how quickly you can
recover from a breech right so you must

122
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,180
define artios recovery time objectives

123
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,149
how long can my web application for my
database that are you know how long it

124
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:37,229
can be outta class for before the
significant impact of the business right

125
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:42,779
so the ability to automate the
requirements to meet compliance so i'm

126
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,320
not sure about the landscape with in
Romania but certainly within the Middle

127
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,279
East is a huge risk

128
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,850
garment for compliance specifically if
you're working for a bank you have to be

129
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,389
PCI compliant because they want to trade
in math and music art so without this

130
00:08:55,389 --> 00:09:00,249
you cannot will not be training with you
but also for government entities you

131
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,860
know you have to be at least I to
complain but also some of the

132
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,089
organizations are state dependence of
the state's actually create security

133
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,170
policies and enforce it with the federal
entities and then the public sector at

134
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,319
the same time if you're working with an
oil and gas sector there are specific

135
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:18,248
frameworks like I c64 43 that can help
you basically improve the security

136
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:23,920
posture so by creating and building
compliances you can build the compliance

137
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,128
framework into the security operations
center other things are important is to

138
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:35,050
build our processes right so for example
there are a huge number of processes

139
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,809
that need to be developed as part of a
sea stock and that's something that

140
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,230
we'll discuss later on but one of the
things that you could do is you know

141
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,870
when you're building us our security
operations center you don't necessarily

142
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,370
have to invest in a huge team of
individuals are security analyzer you

143
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,170
know malware reverse engineers incident
responders etc you could actually build

144
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,509
you know capabilities within your team
as well as you extend the team within

145
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:01,839
for example the IT department right so
you have your system admin your network

146
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,699
admins your security admins etc at the
same time you could build trust

147
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:10,389
relationship with the service providers
that can provide you I'd find services

148
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:15,009
so while the components of building a
sock right so real-time monitoring is

149
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:19,569
important so data aggregation so just as
you have in your enterprise environment

150
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:23,199
depending on what kind of industry you
work in you have perimeter

151
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:26,378
next-generation firewalls intrusion
prevention systems where application

152
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:31,750
firewalls load balances a sell-off Lord
explicit proxy the list goes on and on

153
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,470
right you need to be able to integrate
all of these devices into a centralized

154
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:40,449
same solution right which is basically
your along aggregation . of course one

155
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:45,309
of the most important thing is to
correlate the data so if a user has

156
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:51,370
logged in remotely on ssl VPN from Dubai
and at the same time within five minutes

157
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,029
is logged in from Russia then you can
correlate the two data that the two

158
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,899
source IP addresses you know user cannot
be in two different locations within the

159
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,660
same time right so you can use this kind
of data to

160
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,589
identify that there's something
suspicious going on but also building in

161
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,400
a building security operations center
it's important that you know you

162
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,410
justified management what you're doing
right so you need to have he s delays

163
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,630
and kpi's to say for example within this
month we've actually defended against

164
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,700
fifty attacks have prevented you know
five different attempts where USBs

165
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,630
wanted to be plugged in eccentric cetera
right so this will allow you to then

166
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,439
gain better advantage point in getting
better investment from security

167
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,450
perspective so key success factors in
building a soft people process and

168
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,380
technology and I know this is a term
that's used everywhere but people

169
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,050
obviously they need to be trained you
need to have the right sort of people to

170
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,410
be able to deliver see so you need to
have the processes and of course the

171
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:54,280
technology to complement all of that so
just to quickly cover some of the points

172
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,050
proactive monitoring is important right
so being able to make sure that you

173
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,620
wanted to all the different types of
devices are connected in your network

174
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,120
alert notification is important if there
is a security breach who to notify what

175
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,600
is the severity level where is the risk
level and how to remediate that so that

176
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,620
the most important question to ask
yourself is if one of your critical

177
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,030
assets or ERP solutions or web services
which is performing eat in ecommerce

178
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,370
transaction if it's been breached

179
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,620
how do the incident response you have a
plan in place already right event

180
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,950
correlation is important compliance and
other things mentioned before change

181
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,290
management whenever there's a
configuration change in your

182
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,620
infrastructure you need to be able to
make sure that it doesn't impact

183
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,270
security right so for example I'm
firewood admin login to the perimeter

184
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,069
firewall I make a modification because i
need to allow a port on my web server

185
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,330
but this could impact security right so
change management with an IT

186
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,550
infrastructure must correlate to
security into the response behavior

187
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,410
analysis reporting aspects again these
are very important points and of course

188
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,780
everything is then comes down to from a
risk perspective so now when we look at

189
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,600
the second example architecture you can
see here for example you have all the

190
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,900
different type of components you have
your internet layer this is where you

191
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,540
connect to this

192
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,870
is provided you might have to service
providers you have a perimeter which is

193
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,650
typically your you know for a
next-generation firewall you have

194
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,920
potentially might be having a
distributed denial-of-service DDoS

195
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,510
mitigation tools your IPS etc and then
you have your DMV or public services

196
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,920
this is the primary attack vector from
the external point of view right and

197
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,640
then you might have internal middleware
type applications back in databases

198
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,150
mainframes etc these are all sitting
above what we call the data acquisition

199
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:46,280
layer right collecting the data from
different methods using this logs at the

200
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,490
eyes xml odbc log files etc on top of
that you have the data collaboration

201
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,610
layer where you have policy management
asset management security

202
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,570
vulnerabilities along with event
correlation layer as well and of course

203
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,460
sitting above that you have you know the
security management aspect which is

204
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,440
reporting to to the key management

205
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,310
typically when building a salt we've
seen successfully implemented where you

206
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:16,160
have similar components right so here
you have your different devices all

207
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,900
sending log data to the same solution
right so an active directory for example

208
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,790
if you integrate your Active Directory
into the same you're going to get all

209
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,140
the locks right so security logs event
log system logs now what happens if

210
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:36,530
administrator for the active directory
went back to your presentation he logs

211
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:42,560
in and modifies the user gpo's or the
Machine gpo's this impacts the entire

212
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,930
domain these kind of activities should
be marketed and then should be monitored

213
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,290
against was it a violent change request
that somebody actually raise the change

214
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,420
request to perform this action right so
you can now see the link where you have

215
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,430
the logs you need to be compliant does
it meet the compliance requirements and

216
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,829
does it meet the requirements from a
change perspective some of the other

217
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,460
things that can do can also be done is
integrating with service desk so for

218
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:16,070
example if there's an incident how you
actually you know raise the ticket for

219
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,580
the investigation to occur and also you
can integrate with vulnerability

220
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,300
assessment tools as well so what are the
kids you know some of the components you

221
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,060
have sim which is not just like
management rights are you collecting

222
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,160
events but also collecting

223
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,110
closer netflow SJ flaws I pics but
another important aspect is building

224
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,000
assets right how many if I ask for
example the question of do you know all

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,230
the assets within your enterprise
environment and have you classify them

226
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:48,110
on a risk level from a criticality of
high to low risk are you able to do that

227
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,829
the usual answer is typically know right
so it's important to build an asset

228
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:55,819
database of all the digital assets
within your environment and that could

229
00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:00,410
be not just pcs and servers but also you
know smart devices like for example

230
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,990
printers voice-over-ip wireless access
points etc right configuration

231
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:12,589
management is important as well so
typically when we when we look at for

232
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:17,540
example you know the security operations
center first-generation you would find

233
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,079
that most of the organizations have a
lock to lock management tool which is

234
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,739
acting like the same collecting all the
data and the security analysts are just

235
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,769
looking at the logs without really
understanding what activities are

236
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,730
happening right and then you have the
security auditors who are running for

237
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,410
example the vulnerability management to
like your you know your nexus your rapid

238
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,639
seven etc and just scanning the network
identifying the vulnerabilities and then

239
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,670
getting them down to the system wants to
patch the systems and then you have the

240
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,839
networking team who are just simply
monitoring using an SNMP monitoring tool

241
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,410
the links which is rather as acceptor
right now each one of these is working

242
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,009
in a silo they don't have any
integration so for example if we find

243
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,250
that you know distributed
denial-of-service attack on a network

244
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,480
interface is connected to your internet
zone right that will have a security

245
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,539
impact with the part that the person is
going to identify it is going to be the

246
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:11,209
network monitoring guys because they
want during the internet perimeter out

247
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:16,100
using SNMP so that the approach is
usually to have an integrated stock

248
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,389
rights where you can build automation so
one of the key things that can be done

249
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,189
is you can send all the logs from your
different type of devices to your sim

250
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,809
solution and then one of the things you
can find for example is the same

251
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:33,590
solution connects to the service desk
whenever there's for example incidents

252
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,418
that need to be reported and offenses
that need to be generated and the same

253
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:40,760
status same same time at the top

254
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,720
right inside you see vulnerability
assessment right so the security orders

255
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,770
are coming out scans or pen testers are
coming out the apt exercises all the

256
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,460
vulnerability data is not coming back
into the same so you are able to

257
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,500
identify that a particular system that
has been you know that I used when you

258
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,330
do see malicious traffic or suspicious
activity it actually does have a

259
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,550
vulnerability right and at the same time
compliance and monitoring so this is

260
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,460
typically the integration points when we
see a successful start being implemented

261
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,260
now some of the key important points in
building sockets to have the process in

262
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,570
place right data security monitoring
data as the classification normalization

263
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:25,850
data distribution event management each
different type of device generates a

264
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,379
huge amount of logs so if you take for
example a cisco a firewall it has

265
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,900
generally something like 17,000 logs
that it can generate events right

266
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,110
obviously we're not interested in that
because it is not all security specific

267
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,189
so you have to define exactly the type
of syslog event ideas that you want the

268
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,790
same thing that goes from Microsoft
Active Directory domain it generates a

269
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,530
huge amount of logs right so you have to
define exactly which event IDs this is

270
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,700
you know that needs to be marketed and
then having an incident response

271
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,490
practice in place so if there's an
incident breach

272
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,310
what are the things that need to happen
one of the things that we've I don't

273
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,810
mean usually come across is whenever
there's a breach the customers or

274
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,730
enterprises are not prepared in terms of
the readiness of it right

275
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,590
so having a process in place in terms of
communicating to the right individuals

276
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,699
how to isolate how to contain the issue
these are very important aspects and in

277
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,020
many cases you then have to also report
to report to national search right so if

278
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,840
you have a national search in the
country sometimes you're you know you're

279
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,370
also expected to integrate and talk to
them as all you can you should also

280
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,959
build a stock operating guidelines right
so how often do the stock island this

281
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,290
work is it by 5 24 x seven depending on
the type of support you need

282
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,370
escalation management is very important
right you need to be able to ensure that

283
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,129
whenever there is a cyber security
breach you escalate to the right . in

284
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,490
time data recovery procedures as
mentioned right so whenever there's a

285
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,340
breeze you need to be able to recover
and also every single type of security

286
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:00,428
incident has a different outcome right
so email phishing attack is a different

287
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:05,169
communicate communication mechanism in
place if it's a malware outbreak there's

288
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:09,279
a different process in place is it just
you know DDoS attack again is a

289
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,600
different outcome in place if there's an
internal disgruntled employee is not

290
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,539
happy with the organization because he's
been terminated installing a backdoor

291
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:21,549
there's another process in place to the
point I'm trying to make is within a

292
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:26,020
sock you have different types of
incidents and different incidents will

293
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,960
have different actionable items just
furthermore vulnerability manage patch

294
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,830
management and one of the important
things is to build operating guidelines

295
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,520
i'm skipping through some of the slides
but you will get them as part of us

296
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,789
follow this so it's very important that
when you're building a sock you

297
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,330
understand your overall environment
right without this you're blind

298
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,429
so you can only monitor what you know so
identify your infrastructure you know

299
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:59,380
what kind of environment you have your
internet connectivity DMZ back in data

300
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,059
centers mpls infrastructure you have
extra nice you have connectivity to

301
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,379
third parties ipsec ssl VPN try to
understand what your infrastructure

302
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,590
looks like because once you understand
your infrastructure and you understand

303
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,620
the services then you will have better
you know you have better success factor

304
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,600
in building sort this is one of the
things that we typically tend to do at

305
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,908
least but you'll see at the top

306
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:31,960
try to get mass working alright so this
is a typical example where we basically

307
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,970
build a security catalog and what is
this this is the Internet routers these

308
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,350
are the perimeter firewalls this is the
dns over this is the web

309
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,000
this is the Lord balancer with web
application firewall and this is the web

310
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,200
server so if you're an enterprise and
you're providing for example ecommerce

311
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,100
services typically this is the kind of
service you might be or security you

312
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,000
might be following it's important that
you understand all the services you're

313
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,250
providing on your DMV services and start
creating the flaws so here if you if you

314
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,299
follow for example you know my mouse who
come to the Internet routers through the

315
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:07,820
printer

316
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,379
viral on the Eagles own ingress and
egress on you'll be coming into the load

317
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,820
balancer which will hit the virtual IP
which will then come back to the

318
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,169
firewall as an internal zone and then
come back out again and hit the server

319
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:26,390
so this is my server here now
understanding the service flows will

320
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,830
allow you to monitor this service for
any abnormalities any security breaches

321
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,490
and that's exactly what you need to
monitor within the operation center

322
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,820
using heat maps to visualize this also
you know becoming more and more

323
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,720
important because in stock we always
find that this huge amount of logs that

324
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,830
come in and it's very difficult to
identify exactly the particular that

325
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,510
might be causing a note intrusion the
building heat map is important and you

326
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,770
can again into a vulnerability data into
your into your system solutions or as

327
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,580
well

328
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,149
building an acid repository is very
important right so every single digital

329
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,080
asset within your enterprise environment
should be labeled and if you follow any

330
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,909
compliance standards or international
international security standards like

331
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:18,380
ISO 27001 pci IC 624 434 scotter and
also there's a lot of discussions

332
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,510
yesterday around IOT security

333
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,629
well as you know some of the guys were
mentioning this now stands there is no

334
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,130
standard but there is a working progress
standard for next cyber and physical

335
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:33,950
security draft so there are standards
are being developed but it's important

336
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,480
that you build an asset repository and
you identify for example the business

337
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,660
owners and the technical owners because
when there is a breach

338
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,890
you don't need to inform the technical
person the IT administrator but you also

339
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,050
need to inform the business owner right
towards the business process as part of

340
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,139
building a sock you need to of course
harden your infrastructure so this is an

341
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,610
example where you should look at the
firewall configuration and start

342
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,679
performing hardening guidelines and
identify what needs to be hardened so

343
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,170
once you've identified the unit need to
build the sock you need to start

344
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,670
creating threat cases so identify
exactly for example within your

345
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,510
environment

346
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,510
what kind of threat cases you need to
develop so

347
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,550
you will have extra environments
internet environment data center Active

348
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,300
Directory net for analysis for more
access wireless these are all the

349
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,600
different environments within your
enterprise and you need to build thread

350
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,879
cases i give an example

351
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,420
everybody uses emails to communicate
ninety percent or even ninety-five

352
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,680
percent of our communications / emails
right now within an enterprise you ten

353
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:45,130
typically tend to use microsoft exchange
now within microsoft exchange if there

354
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,360
is an exchange administrator he can
literally log onto the machine on the

355
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,209
exchange server copy the mailbox of CEO
and drag and drop it into his mailbox or

356
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,140
save on the USB right so if you're not
monitoring privileged access or

357
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:04,120
privileged accounts you can't identify
any non-compliance you're not on

358
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,989
conformities so these are the types of
threat cases that should be developed

359
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,070
within your enterprise environment so
you what you can do for example build

360
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,360
configuration baseline documents for red
hat enterprise linux for windows

361
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,260
machines for example so this is a threat
case document for Windows environment so

362
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:26,080
if you see here OS wins your 10 this is
basically the offense naming convention

363
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,350
so what you can do is when you're
building threat cases in your

364
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,250
environment you can give it a specific
name tag and that's the tag you used

365
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,480
when you to generate new general
offenses that's exactly the tag the tune

366
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,020
that use so multiple log on from a
single user from different locations

367
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:46,240
right this should not happen could
obviously indicate a breach or the

368
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,680
passion password is being shared with
another user in another country right so

369
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,770
these are some of the things that you
can actually develop within within your

370
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,960
environment so just to give an example
in building threat cases it's not a

371
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,400
clear diagram but i'll try to explain it
so you have an ax over so it's like it's

372
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,980
like an IBM AIX server unix type of unix
based system you have to use uses a and

373
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,530
uses be right there both ssh connecting
with more remote access

374
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,590
SSH on the x over now

375
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:22,030
user logs in with his unique username
using be logs in with his unique users

376
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:27,760
username but both of them perform the
pseudo or su root right so both become

377
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,610
rich uses

378
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:35,340
now how are you able to differentiate
root user belongs to use a or used to be

379
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,590
right so the point is that you have to
correlate the data and you have to go

380
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,459
through the environment and understand
the different services you're providing

381
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,240
and make sure that you monitoring the
right things because more often than not

382
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,020
what we find is in a customer's deploy
solutions and build a security

383
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,350
operations center but actually eighty
ninety percent of the time they're not

384
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,600
monitoring the right things building a
fence management workflow right so the

385
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,189
most important thing is within within
building a sock is to reduce the false

386
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,450
positives so you can build a workflow
one of the things you could also do is

387
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,620
build an internal wiki page with in
stock so all the different thread cases

388
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:19,320
that i mentioned you can actually import
them into into the wiki page itself so

389
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,000
basically when you're building a sock

390
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,309
it's a centralized internal portal for
all the different thread cases it has

391
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:31,020
bigger like features all the same
processes the documentation is are added

392
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:36,840
into the portal itself so this is just a
sock sock wiki page what's fed into it

393
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,780
for the different processes that i
mentioned about right so if the

394
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,590
different security incidents will have
different processes so you can feed that

395
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,760
into the wiki page all the threat cases
across your environment on the internet

396
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,610
your datacenter your mpls infrastructure
that your server farms a etc workflow

397
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,600
which is your incident response program
right and identify and making sure that

398
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,139
you know this this false positives and
false negatives and then you you

399
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,990
actually learn from the incident and the
feedback system in place

400
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:09,900
this will allow the organization to go
from a reactive situation to being

401
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,710
proactive right so the idea in
compliance or at least from a security

402
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,559
maturity perspective is always to go
from you know that level zero level 1 up

403
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,370
to level three or four and this is
basically epitomized in this diagram

404
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,449
right so most of the organizations that
don't have secured in place that are

405
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:34,140
reactive right they typically tend to
stay at CMM level of capability maturity

406
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,900
model level 1 but as you build a sock as
you people proactive and as you start

407
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,130
driving things in a better way you move
up the

408
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,470
of the chain just finally one of the
things that you could do on a wiki for

409
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,990
example is i'm not i mean i'm sure you
know about RSA RSA token authentication

410
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,020
for example is the two-factor
authentication that you use to login

411
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,710
what you could do is you could for
example identify the different thread

412
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,930
cases you can see here you go triple
eight RS 800 1 2007 these are the

413
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,490
different thread cases if there is an
incident for example related 2001 where

414
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,560
you have excessive reject messages you
can identify that and it basically you

415
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,310
create an offense case using 001 and
then from a security operations center

416
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:22,720
perspective whoever's got that offense
ID which is put into the wiki page and

417
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,630
would get all the details about exactly
what needs to be done to remediate that

418
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,260
particular problem so the idea is
building in a better governance and

419
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,560
better monitoring being proactive in
when you're building security operations

420
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,940
center so that's that's my last life as
a lot of information within 30 minutes

421
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,350
but I hope you know about the gist of it
i'd like to thank death cab for inviting

422
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,580
us it was a pleasure being here and if
there's any questions then by all means

423
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:52,899
i know i'm not a lot of problems that
you have when you're talking about

424
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:58,030
instant response procedures and policies
that's a living document it's like

425
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,720
because the technology is going to
change what's the best way to combat

426
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,630
that because you know the people that
you're going to contact for instant

427
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,480
response are going to be different that
the do you do it

428
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,460
role-based or do it do it specifically
to the person and also how often should

429
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:18,070
a person a company or organization look
at their procedures and their policies

430
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,750
and revisit that to try to update them
to keep them current good question

431
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:28,000
so typically when it comes to building
processes usually if you look at the

432
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,130
standards they always mentioned to carry
out for example a review of policies

433
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:37,030
upon a major change within
infrastructure or at least in our yearly

434
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,540
basis so that's that's at least what
should happen on a yearly basis but

435
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,090
going back to initial question of
incident response

436
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,770
it really depends right it has to be
service-based so as opposed to in our

437
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,980
system based so one of the things that
we are we always tend to find is that

438
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,340
when you're trying to do and into the
response as a first responder you go

439
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,779
on-site you try to identify

440
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:59,590
exactly what happened but then you you
have the missing links you can't

441
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,820
actually put them together and having a
sock in place will allow you to build

442
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,989
these links because as they gave an
example for example for one of the oil

443
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:12,789
and gas companies which was impacted
they left traces as they perform the

444
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,840
attack right but having a software you
have all the logs being collected are

445
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:25,178
able to do that so it really depends
make any other questions

446
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:29,320
no and thank you so much for
presentation
