1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,829
ok so Alex J

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:15,540
most of the people like a calming and
this is Italian for Alex and we're gonna

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:23,710
want to talk about two things basically
we're calling it a new hope because of

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,689
the hype wave you know Star Wars movie
but the thing is we're seeing a lot of

5
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:36,020
young talent in Romania and not only I
mean everybody's looking and the next

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:43,260
generation and they're horrified yeah we
would basically like to debunk that me

7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,150
and we would like to tell you guys how
we find great talents here in Romania in

8
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:56,870
our you know area security researchers
and the next thing is related to IIT and

9
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,780
something that we've been focusing on
for the past two-and-a-half three years

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:10,399
three hours and the OT village which is
happening in the general ok so about us

11
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:20,009
what we're part of a team that sucks the
hackers so basically the job of the team

12
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:27,909
that actually that way over their
coordinates will view their job is to

13
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:36,759
find bad guys to take down botanists and
ironically talking about you know how

14
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,259
the police tries to criminalize security
research at the same time we are working

15
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:48,990
with the police doing security research
and helping them arrest bad guys

16
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,080
actually know the name of the team

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,700
they both know that's the city if team
our team is called global cybersecurity

18
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:10,850
investigations which is GTSI oh yeah so
it's it's kind of ironic because again

19
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:21,510
and I was asking good bowler the police
needs so criminalizing security research

20
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:29,640
is damaging as he was saying earlier to
human life because the bad guys don't

21
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,750
give a shit about the law right it's
what they do is trade just go outside of

22
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,040
the law and if we r restricted by the
law to do security research then that

23
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,260
means that the bad guys we always have
an upper hand always but ironically the

24
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,899
police neither so for some reason we are
able to do it

25
00:02:50,900 --> 00:03:00,930
ok next the team that silly coordinates
does while participating seattle City

26
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,380
Chiefs lot of steps they do

27
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,720
academic happy hacking so to speak and
recently they have trained this young

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,160
generation of talents that participated
in two

29
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:25,340
Europe security cyber security services
security challenge yeah yeah he's one of

30
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,250
the about it and and we have as a
company we have a very strong focus on

31
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,300
out these so partially my area the
things that I'm looking at is a research

32
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,860
and data security research ok now I'm
gonna pass it on to Catalina to talk

33
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:46,050
about what they have been doing ok so
who here already knows about the

34
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,370
European cyber security challenge
created by any such and there's probably

35
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,700
some people of the Romanian team as well
I think the other ones are preparing to

36
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,530
play in D city of here so couple of
years ago any secrete it came up with

37
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:08,110
the idea of educating people towards
security or cyber security they tried to

38
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,470
do this by creating a a challenge
between countries this year I think was

39
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,029
the third edition economists taking and
Romania was invited as well to

40
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,809
participate we came in quite a bit later
as in we were notified and invited about

41
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,600
June or July something like that and the
competition is in October the other

42
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,270
countries had they selected their team
back in October last year so they had

43
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,859
quite a bit along time to train about
more than one year and so so we did

44
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,750
West's you start you know finding the
people you need to have 10 people that

45
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,010
are not working in the security industry
do not have certifications he security

46
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,750
answer on to people that find security
as a passion but not necessarily are

47
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,550
active in it maybe they participated
city Ave send a study mostly security on

48
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,500
their own over the internet and whatever
so we organized the preselection

49
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,150
somewhere in August then we had a
training in September together with

50
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:18,780
trainers from Orange say hi ok and the
competition was in October we were in

51
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,440
first but that wasn't the point anyway
the point was to participate there are

52
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,360
several challenges that you have to do
is jeopardy

53
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,939
there is what's the other one attack and
defence where countries attack each

54
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:38,610
other and you have to exploit the other
countries it's a lot of fun and it's

55
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,889
about seven hours

56
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,419
numbers taking including a DND
presentation skills

57
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:50,128
area so when you have two presents one
of the exercises you did during the

58
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:56,729
competition anyways the thing is this
competition is gonna be again one more

59
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:02,188
time next year and he used to come and
although initially rallied three

60
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:07,750
countries this year were six countries
the plan for the next year's to be ten

61
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:14,930
countries and although I cannot
officially confirm at it there's a big

62
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,740
chance that next year's competition is
going to be in Romania so ten countries

63
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,779
are gonna probably come here and compete
and attack each other the next

64
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:31,319
preselection will be probably in
February so who wants to participate

65
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:40,589
please go to cyber security challenge at
ro and wait for news that's it

66
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:46,740
two whole minutes yeah okay so I T

67
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:57,699
well as most of you probably know the
IOT space is huge and according to

68
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,849
statistics and predictions is going to
get the whole number of connected

69
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:09,580
devices is going to get about fifty
billion by 2020 and there's a lot of

70
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,210
crazy stuff so there's decide called
riot a list that I L

71
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:21,770
resource we can find all kinds of crazy
stuff like a portable fishfinder like an

72
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,370
intelligent you're gonna I mean ok we
knew about thermostats we know about you

73
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:32,879
know whatever sprinklers and Mark locks
on intelligent if if anybody can find

74
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,650
something

75
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:45,750
interesting and pink on this flight so
it's an intelligent dildo yeah and we're

76
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,979
kind of joking about it in the office
you know I mean actually it allows the

77
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:56,580
boyfriend or husband or whatever to
control it

78
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,948
while the woman is on the other side of
the world and we are kinda joking if

79
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:08,330
hackers you know tax into the account
and does better than the husband a way

80
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,900
this is great news for boys as well
there is the intelligent flashlight I

81
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:20,760
saw the thing is all these devices are
as you might imagine are not perfect

82
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:27,150
because as the things stand right now
there are no standards when it comes to

83
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:34,779
building building stuff you know like
creating our devices so Amazon is trying

84
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,610
to build a platform Google is trying to
build a platform a lot of companies are

85
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:45,310
trying to create the standards which we
believe would be great if people

86
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,369
actually use them but the fact of the
matter is that the creators of the

87
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:56,010
intelligent dildo built their own stuff
their own operating system i mean that

88
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:03,040
little thing and that application on the
phone have little have have have an

89
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,390
operating system right we've seen I
devices that that were running a busy

90
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:15,459
box from 2007 I mean all the way back to
2007 with all the vulnerability that

91
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:18,989
were discovered since then including
shell shocked including hardly none

92
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,740
whatever so the fact that they want to
build their own stuff and just get the

93
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:31,459
device out faster and the fact that as
always the compromising security for

94
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:38,279
usability makes our lives harder as you
know providers of security because

95
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:45,029
people look at us and say well you know
we paid we want so we don't care if it's

96
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,180
not windows or we don't care if it's not
late

97
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,920
so we don't care if he's not Android
which you guys on most security

98
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,610
companies advertise that they support we
want protection so we had to start this

99
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:05,580
lab that does research in achieving our
abilities and what we found is again

100
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,650
scary and it's stuff that most of you
already know you know for example most

101
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:17,579
devices in your household mostly devices
in the households allow commands a lot

102
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,410
on an authenticated commands the hours
so all you need to do is just been the

103
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,390
same network with the device and cast
and commands you can talk to it and

104
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:34,730
interact with it what else most light
bulbs allow an unauthenticated commands

105
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,630
via UDP

106
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:45,320
most devices a lot have SQL injections
or have vulnerabilities in the former

107
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,800
you can basically if you can extract the
former than you can find a lot of our

108
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,130
abilities in that in there so there are
no standards when it comes to

109
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:03,510
so to that end and our research aside we
came and we talked to the guys from

110
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:10,740
death camp and we can with the idea of
building an idea village here and we

111
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,910
finished it last night at twelve o'clock
me pipe and it's live now it's in the

112
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:30,240
funeral and it's actually let me see if
we can get a feed from it

113
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,300
there's one person scared the shit out
of him

114
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:45,990
can actually controls as well so this is
from one of the devices ok the room is

115
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,310
empty because all of you are here now
but I'm gonna guess you're gonna spread

116
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:54,349
to these were you know and this is from
one of the devices deserve it from one

117
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:03,170
of the devices that were putting up for
hiking so this is a nice camp and which

118
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:18,490
impacted is so basically you have to do
is sit down with the laptop connected to

119
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,850
the local network that it's a private
network separated from the rest of the

120
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,700
camp and then you're gonna be provided
with the IP addresses of the device is

121
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,040
connected and if you have it you can go
home with it

122
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,550
well it's not that simple if you find an
XSS vulnerability maybe we're gonna wait

123
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,760
a bit more maybe somebody find something
that provides remote code execution and

124
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,660
maybe somebody can get a root shell on
the device so basically the

125
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,329
vulnerability with the most impact will
yield the device to the one that found

126
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:56,839
it there is going to be a judge there's
a judge on site and the judge will help

127
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:03,459
you with all your needs and these are
devices that are up for grabs

128
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:09,410
there's a doorbell yes

129
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:17,310
ok so there's a durable there is this
ugly world really beautiful for some

130
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,319
apparently some guy came last night I
started to get it and call it my

131
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:27,670
precious it's anything wrong at all it's
the most expensive one of the most

132
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:35,029
expensive home router sexing so far and
well I'm not gonna talk more about it

133
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:42,189
but it has been our ability and it's not
trivial to exploit its fun to explain ok

134
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:50,509
so and then there is this next camp that
was trimming the rear and last but not

135
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,360
least the one that we gonna probably
have to take home with us because it's

136
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,370
all be ok that's about it

137
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:08,199
we have one more plug we're going to use
it for us so we're hiring if you know

138
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:14,490
about 30 if you know about if you're
into security we have to open positions

139
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,230
for researchers focused on I think so

140
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,240
doctor was fined US Europe if you if
you're interested i think thats about it

141
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,790
wasn't long it was exactly two minutes

142
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:36,189
questions any other questions

143
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:57,170
well then it's a private networks are
going to have to go away so this is

144
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:03,810
happening in the general it's all the
way in at the other end of the compound

145
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:10,979
and there you will find that table and
those currently empty seats and if you

146
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,830
can find a spot just sit down

147
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:19,800
blogger laptop into the network and
you'll have access to the devices hello

148
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:29,199
can we use the feet from the nest cam to
scare the shit out of them over the I

149
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,270
think you can talk to him from this room
maybe play God with him was something I

150
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,790
don't like to allow flash tools my
microphone but for young gonna make an

151
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:45,860
exception

152
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:54,640
and the five in the URL is still if the
link to the camp to defeat now if the

153
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:05,930
internets are going to be without K

154
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,099
we are watching

155
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:38,950
reaction probably focused ok any other
person's okay then so I was in London

156
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:44,890
last week attending the session held by
Kevin Ashton is the guy that coined the

157
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:50,250
term IOT and he was talking about
Kickstarter as the platform for bad

158
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:56,570
ideas where all the people are building
intelligent devices that can do anything

159
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:02,170
and some of them you've even showed the
fact that there is no standard no

160
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:09,560
security guidelines in the world of IOT
how do you think we as a community or we

161
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:16,409
as an ecosystem could tackle that moving
forward could make sure that current IOT

162
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:22,120
devices and future alt devices have
sorry have that security component

163
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:29,669
embedded from the get-go and this is
just so that we can prevent larger

164
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:37,520
issues in the future when I O T becomes
more prevalent in in our daily lives

165
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,500
well there are already steps being taken
into the direction so there's very low

166
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,940
so Google least stunning you earlier
Google and Amazon are trying to build a

167
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,110
platform on which I D manufacturers can
just their hardware so they provide the

168
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,649
soft so Amazon provides the cloud
platform and Google tries to provide the

169
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,590
software platform based on wage you only
have to you know how come up with a

170
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,250
harder and the concept and use their
software and that would be a great step

171
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,460
forward because you're gonna have only
one operating system and some additional

172
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,560
software but significantly less to
secured and that is currently now if

173
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,700
that doesn't happen then I guess it's
going to be up to us to try to talk to

174
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,450
law enforcement to allow us to the
security research and publish the

175
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:40,020
advisories and talk to the vendors the
problem here is that there are so many

176
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,830
goddamn devices you know

177
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,269
all the people in this room and the
entire security community worldwide I

178
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:53,750
don't think we would be able to do
research in one month in on all of them

179
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,919
because they're so many undergoing
explanation because everybody everybody

180
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,149
wants to build their own I T the
craziest thing just one second so I was

181
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:10,268
this company called double leaf a
pronounced it correctly there there the

182
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:14,990
underlying layer for most hardware
vendors so even if it had something on

183
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,690
the label or model on the label it's
actually probably built by Shah bill

184
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,799
they have about 250,000 employees and
had this conference about people that

185
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,690
use them to build a harder and they saw
the most craziest

186
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:34,769
so bad grammar the craziest device ever
something that's the equivalent of

187
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:43,730
electronic drugs seriously so imagine
we'd on batteries so there's this device

188
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,539
that can you put on your head

189
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:51,990
hear your touch it it's like i don't
know this big and with an application on

190
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,019
your phone you said it he said the mood
that you want to be as they come

191
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:07,610
or energetic and I thought it went for
me I was stupid and curious and then you

192
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,719
have something like a dial sorry 23 2012
the level that you want to sell it and

193
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,549
when I reach point for point five I had
sweat on the back of my head and I

194
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:27,289
almost passed out it was the scariest
thing I've ever seen and after 23

195
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,100
minutes of drawing like

196
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:36,389
around there I came to and I started
talking to the guy was with and we're

197
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:43,110
thinking about the implications of that
technology so imagine for example our

198
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:49,260
inability to 7 passing out and the thing
keeps pumping stuff into your head or

199
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,640
even worse than that so there was an
application that was talking to a remote

200
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,630
server shirt I mean it didn't say that
it was looking for a more thorough but

201
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:03,460
we all know what occasions we have so
there was this application that was

202
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,409
really talking to a remote server and if
a bad guy who'd had that most of us have

203
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:15,220
all of you probably seen Kingsmen right
Kingsmen you know will kill all people

204
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:30,490
with one button because so you have
buzzing in your so if you had the server

205
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,159
that talks to the applications and let's
let's settle this like a hundred

206
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,970
thousand people using the device and
then if you have the app you could

207
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:46,480
basically said it to 10 to everybody and
knock everybody out or worse it's one of

208
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,750
those movies in areas that I was
actually seeing come to life when I used

209
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,350
that stuff and almost passed out because
of it and that's the end of

210
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,500
representation

211
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:06,080
yeah I wanted to point out that we keep
talking about I roti referring to

212
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,360
next-generation devices right like all
the windows of the intelligent you don't

213
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,820
have the world but yeah but there is one
particular device that you included in

214
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,760
your eye out a list that's actually the
original device which is the router and

215
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:32,500
the rotary central in in this discussion
because as you mentioned all of the

216
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,170
royalties are created with the
presumption that your internal network

217
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:41,650
is secure so if you're not already
secured doesn't really matter if we

218
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:47,120
allow indicated commands and open telnet
port and whatever on the internet or

219
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,820
because it secure but a rotary securing
your network right and daughters have

220
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:59,000
been vulnerable for a very long time
it's not something new so shouldn't we

221
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,930
first focus on getting actually
requesting security as a feature from

222
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:11,580
router manufacturers so they actually
build secure about us first and then

223
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,899
maybe be more concerned about them or
because they don't have a lot of

224
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,720
adoption rated but rather do have people
don't really understand that the rotor

225
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,230
is probably the most important devised a
having their hop in the home

226
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,670
more important than the laptop
smartphone it's the gateway to the

227
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:36,650
Internet is the gateway back in so I see
a lot of discussion about I'll tease in

228
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,880
securing loyalties and all of these
devices but I don't see a lot of effort

229
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,700
put into improving the security of
Realtors basically right end and the

230
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,950
fact that you mention that there are no
royalties security standards we have to

231
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:57,410
understand that there are no security
standards for any embedded devices for

232
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,270
most for building most embedded devices
including routers and all of these

233
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:06,000
people that know beautiful new i/o to
divide and devices where they come from

234
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,059
the come from the

235
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:12,129
hardware building industry the ones that
built embedded devices we are the world

236
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:16,809
standards so they continue to perpetuate
the same the same thing so it's not only

237
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:23,470
a novelty problem it's a much larger
problem you know that we are working on

238
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:33,389
that but I don't want to turn this into
a product pitch so we we as a company

239
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:40,149
are are building a device that tries to
address exactly what john was saying on

240
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:48,139
the same topic we also want to create
this awareness I mean this education we

241
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:54,360
want to define it did because there are
so many definitions for OT people think

242
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,080
I would tease relate to thermostats and
stop within the homes we personally

243
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,779
believe that coyotes relate to
absolutely any device that can connect

244
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:08,590
to another device and interact with your
homework with your life one way or

245
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,189
another that's what we call it may be a
laptop maybe a pacemaker or maybe a

246
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:20,100
writer that's what we consider as I T
and on your topic you know about the guy

247
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:26,658
that had $10,000 and patch them so this
Batman of the Internet these vigilante

248
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:31,759
are here some guy had 10,000 Netgear out
of trouble if there were you know and

249
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,769
and patch them yes definitely

250
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:37,320
router should be able to do
vulnerability assessments within your

251
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,389
network and try to scan your devices and
see which ones are updated

252
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:45,149
what software version they're using what
kind of traffic there doing try to

253
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:49,090
sanitize at least a sleepy traffic
writer Steve there some you know

254
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,869
directory traversal travel stories
happening for those devices like this

255
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:56,959
eve they're doing some accessing some
abnormal URLs they should definitely be

256
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,249
doing that some of them are just to
clarify wasn't speaking about the

257
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:06,580
routers acting as an ideas or iPS or
something like that I was actually

258
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,908
speaking about the rotor being the
vulnerable device the one that can get

259
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:15,590
the ones that do have a lot of
vulnerabilities and vendors are not

260
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:21,759
really reacting and not reacting because
security is not viewed as a future they

261
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:27,830
can compete on as long as users we don't
don't ask for this feature and they

262
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,739
don't get pushed into it does not gonna
focus their development and I read our

263
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:41,399
R&D resources on the secure development
lifecycles and internal penetration

264
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:46,998
testing included reviews and all that so
they could keep putting out vulnerable

265
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:53,330
routers compared to other iDevices there
are actually my scale attacks against

266
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,019
Rogers we know about hundreds of
thousands of others being compromised

267
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,269
and brought together into a botnet and
are over the past two years it's only

268
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:07,899
been increasing we see more and more of
these attacks so I see this as a more

269
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:14,799
urgent issue then let's talk about the
new ok sexy stuff right

270
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:22,049
diabetes which are you feeling well I
think that for starters hardware

271
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:26,999
manufacturers or other manufacturers
could start with bug bounties would

272
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:32,580
start by encouraging people to hide them
responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities

273
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,449
that they found and this is this is a
thing that unfortunately so rare these

274
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,349
days in this world in the rotor world
let's call it and and the hardware world

275
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:49,049
I don't know if it's because they're
scared because obviously they shouldn't

276
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:52,279
be scared they should encourage this
because this is responsible disclosure

277
00:27:52,279 --> 00:28:00,779
is significantly better than getting
hacked by a bad guy I think it's also PR

278
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:08,039
thing for example dealing red line on
the table it has availability has been

279
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,669
patched in this particular case we
didn't update the router because it's a

280
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:17,970
fun to exploit a vulnerability but it
has been passionate billing issues

281
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,770
updates it's just a matter of

282
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,070
making it easy for the user to know that
there's an update which is i mean it's

283
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,580
not the case I'm sure that everybody's
grandmother mother or sister in some

284
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,800
cases or brother would not have no idea
that doesn't update available for their

285
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:41,669
asses well let's not ever being groped
or Linksys router and have no idea that

286
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,760
there is an update available even if
they did maybe the god they got an email

287
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:53,370
they wouldn't know how to apply it so I
mean what I'm talking about these

288
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,399
education consumer education right I'm a
journalist I do my part I write about

289
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,360
this I inform the public

290
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,719
dunno who else could do this you guys
because you have constant you have users

291
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,850
have helped consumers inhibit the people
who rely on you for information about

292
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:16,350
threats or alerts or stuff like that so
you should educate them about the

293
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:21,250
importance of security in the rotors so
they can the population can ask for that

294
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:26,220
feature and it's only then that
manufacturers will actually start to

295
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,590
consider building secure outdoors
because it's what the water customers

296
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,199
ask if they don't do this another vendor
does these users were good with other

297
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,980
vendor right that's an excellent point
and it's something that we have already

298
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,090
started to do so in most of our
presentations in most of our talks and

299
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,010
in most popular we are starting to push
this kind of feedback or this kind of

300
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,050
information to the user

301
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:58,470
so if there are no other questions then
we thank you for your patience and I'm

302
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,420
sure you want to get some coffee I know
I do so thank you are here
