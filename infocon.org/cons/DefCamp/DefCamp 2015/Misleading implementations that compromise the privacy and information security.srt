1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,550
good morning everyone i'm come from

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:10,969
resume 14 that talk about this is a
great pressure tribute to be here I

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,860
would like to thank you

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:20,800
Andry Rajoelina and the organization of
the different if I loved this discount

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:30,310
is beautiful city I discovered yesterday
I have part of it might be in a user

6
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:38,150
remaining I discovered yesterday thank
you well my my my presentation to use my

7
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:44,510
name is Javier winter Luton carnival in
Brazil I would like to to present my

8
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:55,870
lucky 817 misleading fermentation that
compromise Privacy Information Security

9
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:04,408
Jim the spartan the gym is very fast
boogie 817 what standard for looking

10
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,030
questions about how great my problem

11
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:18,469
laws and test it defend their issues
through pretty issues other credit hours

12
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:24,908
after it locker softer and conclusions

13
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:35,479
objectives goals show venerable its
encryption software to present some bags

14
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:44,329
on a cybersecurity two Pro Bowls a
mitigation actions

15
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:53,699
817 Bible situation was reading a long
time ago but i think is is this concept

16
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,520
is very up-to-date here because for
doing nothing hiding that will not be

17
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:09,038
disclosed in in in consumer that will
not be no doubt into the open

18
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:19,230
is a name when you think about
surveillance asked about my my boundary

19
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:27,790
off my my researches if you wonder if I
want to see or CIO company you stole his

20
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:34,700
or her hair on groups of softer side of
your machine I wonder whose stellar

21
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:42,589
configure equipped are softer side
machine when I look for mission security

22
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:50,840
we look yet only technical schools only
aspect technical aspect but under

23
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,510
cybersecurity you are ranch all their
concepts involved and a protected

24
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:04,250
information we have people process
environment industry in this point we

25
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:19,609
have observation in the governor bill we
discover in this water problem I think

26
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:25,060
it's not because you have a clear met
met go from the nation in the softer and

27
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:33,629
all worried if you try to come to break
out the softer you have large

28
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:40,518
consumption of computer time this is a
money when you think of this they are

29
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:54,810
possible on the comical break this hour
in this point where is a problem let's

30
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:03,639
remember that chain is only as strong as
its weakest link you should have people

31
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:10,040
processes and environment and our
technology deployed technology I have a

32
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,970
problem

33
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,940
implementation again

34
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:22,660
process environment where is the problem
how to read music are implementing

35
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:31,630
softer softeners friendly user because
my see all my CIO my manager Dr don't

36
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:38,450
have technical skews here

37
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:46,620
manager think about the strategy not
technical schools people are still

38
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:56,530
eludes computers because my manager
travel between airport bus station and

39
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:10,059
subway this is a part of problem in this
is like we can see that there is a big

40
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,800
company about it

41
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:24,490
2013 our computer employs the third
Bardo Petrobras stolen computers we

42
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:36,419
we've secret the state's inside the
computers in his ex president of Brazil

43
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:43,370
declared use the situation I tell
security appreciate our cost of losing

44
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:55,920
left in the computers are each device's
$115,000

45
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:06,170
our research we will look at the market
because I would like to to know what is

46
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:15,100
most important most important soft heard
the disk encryption software we we found

47
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:25,710
that there is a statkus get locker and
the first in the second and 32 crypt and

48
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:36,570
beat defender restart their assertion in
this streets after the first when he was

49
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:43,950
in stout defender inside your computer
you need to create a file encrypted file

50
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:49,960
is in this group defied has two parts

51
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:59,489
space of user to put your your your your
file I had their store information about

52
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:15,100
the user password and the first thing we
think about this

53
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:23,180
manager or CEO are high level are a
company c-level you start your computer

54
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:30,270
or a softer and softer i think is not
because I think about the stretches

55
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:38,580
probably technicians install the softer
in 2008 the first time the best word

56
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:51,599
after this time to give up a computer
CEO and the CEO changing the password

57
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,470
because this is a breast best bets in
information security and change again

58
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,770
and again

59
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:13,400
want once twice three times everyone
after trip times we have a new friend

60
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:25,729
had theirs in this case but what happens
in this situation what we discovered if

61
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:34,740
you could order the final number one and
mix file number three you can download

62
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:43,729
this file after many changed the
password and kill open this file and

63
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:53,950
Nexus all information inside this
operation you can open this texts this

64
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:15,339
famous softer and softer but was stopped
its development in 2014 is a strange

65
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:23,170
situation because if you look at the
Wayback Machine all files in the

66
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,319
TrueCrypt was the elite

67
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:41,470
way back machine I pick up but the same
situation I difference between TrueCrypt

68
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:49,310
filed in the bitter defender Heather
position of Heather opposition in the

69
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,310
begin

70
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,640
but the same you have a header

71
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:15,980
the space user five tries three times
you agree with my first time in the

72
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,760
third file is different

73
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:35,640
other but again we can this marriage had
their number one and they were treated

74
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:48,400
and can't open in texas all files inside
of the side the trip to file again

75
00:10:48,400 --> 00:11:02,410
probably I can spend all lost lost my my
money do you see this project after

76
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:10,670
after trip to stop the its development
is this project started as a fork

77
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,860
discontinued the project but

78
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:38,510
this same even our ability to protect
and the beat defender

79
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,630
trip to stop the developing developer

80
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:52,370
altars of the the the the softer
indicate a bit longer as a substitute to

81
00:11:52,370 --> 00:12:00,899
quit when they use start when you
configure your meat locker you needs to

82
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:15,079
mandatory to creation of partition aside
the computer the first you create again

83
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:23,899
but you have a space 100 characters
include all characters in the SQL table

84
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,380
is our routing number of combinations

85
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:45,939
and the second system define key 48
digitalis america's 29 if you don't

86
00:12:45,940 --> 00:13:05,720
print out our safety or recovery key and
never speak it's impossible to partition

87
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,300
power is ruj when compared

88
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:24,579
American Recovery Key i think is a final
weakens our allies in their

89
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:31,980
implementation because you're strained
you are seeking strength security is

90
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:40,860
recovery key if you remember it again

91
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:56,700
a final weekends lmao hash lies in their
implementation in this point I have some

92
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,840
advice

93
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:05,320
used reprieve shellfish very quick
disconnects goes to create characters do

94
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,430
it yourself best would create the
container the BitLocker strange of

95
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,250
password is limited

96
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:25,980
48 numerical characters this case my
presentation I and the final and so much

97
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:35,160
to talk we need to modify our
perspective because one lucky and the

98
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,329
cybersecurity you have a technology we
consider technology process environment

99
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,710
and people inside the problem

100
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:51,310
software employment insecurity because
people involved it in softer element in

101
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,239
the price

102
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,810
open free or paid softer have a have a
similar problems

103
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:05,000
information security cannot be based
solely on advertising and you need to

104
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,510
improve our tests because when they
resume with test softer we have a great

105
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:24,360
a great surprise in this case in the
final I would like to invite you to

106
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:35,940
assist my my next presentation
apocalyptic technique because we tested

107
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:43,060
virus 150 antivirus and we discover us
ability

108
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:56,449
0 police watch my presentation my my
contacts thank you so much thank you

109
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:05,150
we have here question yes I have a
question

110
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:12,829
TrueCrypt part of presentation because I
know for a fact that when you change a

111
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:30,410
header in the container can access to
data and we actually can do this if you

112
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:40,040
understand the first time when they
create this is a must passwords yes you

113
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,839
can open 000 container after this time
you change your password

114
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,080
opened the second you change again

115
00:16:51,080 --> 00:17:03,210
master password good definition of
container because took a contender

116
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:17,130
5555 encryption as they are creating a
same partition but is rented it look

117
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:24,640
because it uses a partition or partition
inside the computer is a file encryption

118
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:35,830
ok but because you showed us that by
changing the head there in TrueCrypt

119
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,540
container

120
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:43,210
encrypted files that contain the other
five we can access to this information

121
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:52,910
in this is not true not true this is not
sure if the password is different or the

122
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,150
house because you can

123
00:17:54,150 --> 00:18:07,660
choose one from a file free hashing
methods you need to cut to your daughter

124
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:45,870
in marriage and the file also contains
you you have to you know this is a very

125
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:52,060
good implementation of cryptography you
can't miss problem is not the

126
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:58,220
implementation softer so your example
was about

127
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,500
accessing full disk encryption

128
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,620
operating system and the case when you
have contained there where the password

129
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:17,549
is the same yes okay you didn't know you
were talking about the containers and

130
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:24,190
after your example just looks like that
you after changing how dare you you can

131
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,320
access

132
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:33,470
to the date and so I wanted to clarify
that and understand the exact

133
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:46,940
you have other containers you take out
the first word in marriage

134
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:54,919
you could have their number tree or to
order the file you could talk about us

135
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:00,309
passwords unique passwords when you have
a container encrypted with password and

136
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,730
contain the encrypted with purse would
be and I would like to operate in the

137
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,490
storms discontinue

138
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:22,029
deter harder on the fire it's not
problem you can open container has other

139
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:49,149
formations you can't access now we can
talk about this later and then they

140
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:54,559
stopped producing and then they stopped
enhancing it because of some

141
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:10,360
vulnerabilities right it is but still i
mean i'm saying that they stop enhancing

142
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,678
they stopped watching through right
because indeed even remove the software

143
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:22,610
right so for me because I'm using troops
before he said

144
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:28,530
recommended that I stopped using
TrueCrypt or I can still use it I use

145
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:33,330
so it is but i trade my password

146
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:43,470
yeah this is after I can talk about this
situation and cybercrime Brazil I can

147
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:53,940
see ya I use yeah I'm still using its ok
I will answer this question your can't

148
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:01,040
use TrueCrypt new operating systems
