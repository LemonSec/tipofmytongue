1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
going to have a presentation about the
abstract apocalypse technique let's

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:23,869
welcome there on the four plus one
afternoon everyone my name is Jose I'm

3
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:31,300
come from resume first time in Romania I
like to thank our organization of these

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,160
are you present in the night his
presentation apocalypse security do you

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,640
have do you believe in your protects
this presentation is based in my book

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,950
our book because I i wrote the book in
co-op out of her we feel all of my

7
00:00:50,950 --> 00:01:03,980
colleagues my agenda what is not
apocalypse technique what technique he

8
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:12,950
conclusions and our questions in this
first slide weekends are hard problems

9
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:19,670
in 2009 DHS us' define 11

10
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:27,360
hard problems to solve and the Internet
Information Security you can see a

11
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,090
number five in combating Mauer in Boston
had it's a difficult because in 1987

12
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:43,240
researchers tried calling my knowledge
that virus calling the biggest problems

13
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,809
of information security

14
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:55,380
straight it's impossible to could affect
our way to detect all violence Mars

15
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:04,729
discolorations Starfire because you have
many more hours that our lunch every day

16
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,890
each day about it

17
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,300
25,000 new mars which they

18
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,530
I would like to think about the I'm sure
that your system or protect really do we

19
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:27,700
test our protections properly how are
you testing our system and the last

20
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,369
question are concepts in computer
science

21
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,710
consolidate or away or are there
eventually reviewed in question this is

22
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,870
important because

23
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:49,060
Explorer is actually concept

24
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:59,260
Microsoft patch critical bug that affect
every Windows 95 a serious role that

25
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:09,640
exists for almost 19 years November 2004
again

26
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:19,369
concept are consolidated in 2012 my
colleagues and I am Newton coronary

27
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:31,840
developing carry out to detect to
efficiency in tomorrow's virus that are

28
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:40,209
used in Brazil Brazilian government
because we are really worried about

29
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:51,630
officials when they use when do you see
a result of 180 compare these solutions

30
00:03:51,630 --> 00:04:00,299
is almost perfect but he's not really

31
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,880
in this point we tested

32
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:16,709
terrible believe in with test many many
brands

33
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,260
antivirus brand that you are using

34
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:30,750
we get that about 50% or all the
providers of antivirus use a resume that

35
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:42,190
only 50% this is this is a problem this
point what is not apocalypse apocalypse

36
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:52,550
is a technique to test the apocalypse is
not empowered

37
00:04:52,550 --> 00:05:00,780
is is is different because it's are
limited in terms of the operating system

38
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:12,059
and tomorrow in time what is apocalypse
we call us I brought in this point what

39
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,660
is not immunity what is a cyberattack
immune disease

40
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:27,409
this point

41
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:32,659
we start our computers are you human

42
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:41,989
in cyber immune system because our
interest in exactly immunity system

43
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:53,698
because Antivirus is immune system but
is not immunity is not immune disease is

44
00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:02,669
a disease in which a person wrong left
tackle its only healthy cells tissues

45
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:20,179
there are about eight types of disease
and the Word Alive diabetes type 1 2010

46
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:28,438
metaphor to explain about the human
immune system immune system and the

47
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:36,589
first we have a scheme I skied I think
is a cynic characters cassini function

48
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:47,209
as a resident protection virus I don't
freak sells the same excuse the

49
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:57,629
antivirus engine and again same
character is senator and so one

50
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:10,659
technique is this technique is a
technique shows a misconception of

51
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:17,248
signatures approach and antivirals we
have basically two approaches in the

52
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:26,789
Senators in behavior approach in this
point I will show even seen the actions

53
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:32,748
what happens when there are techniques
when they use a technique apocalypse

54
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:37,100
technique and what happens when the
virus

55
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:44,980
detected deals this point the first
element biological name on cyber

56
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:52,080
equivalents antivirus actions in I act
would act would that there isn't virus

57
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:00,310
the first virus cyber equivalents muller
watch detected this this element removed

58
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:08,460
five sets to this rightness point herman
has backed their commands that fires

59
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:15,840
have equivalents and actions act of
violence is no tracks found as to this

60
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:26,090
right back to reflect the 22 transport
DNA of virus cyber equivalents

61
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:32,400
commanding back to file that's transport
malicious code when the antivirus detect

62
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,679
the techno transforms the tact

63
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:45,630
antivirus attitude is wrong this case
because I have malicious code inside the

64
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:58,300
fire again I have a biological a host
metaphor between

65
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:05,709
cyber immunity system a host we can
compare cyber equivalents anybody gonna

66
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:11,170
program used for transport back tears
that when the antivirus the fact that

67
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:16,219
there's an amount no trades found that
students right I have a particular

68
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:27,910
program beginning program files are user
files that tested and wires effective

69
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:35,620
host effective program that transport
bacteria which was contaminated in this

70
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,360
point

71
00:09:36,360 --> 00:10:00,020
antivirus again no trades front but at
this rate is wrong is wrong inside

72
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:09,900
effective holst in the final I have a
healthy cell cyber equivalents we call

73
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:17,740
user file a softer and softer or
operating system files off the operating

74
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:26,990
system antivirus actions no trades found
let's do this right in this point we

75
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,990
have a trigger that start

76
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:37,300
alt immunity cyber disease because in
this point when in fact when they affect

77
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,550
the fire and fact the program

78
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:48,760
antivirus not detected this this process
i buy alleged abductor transmitting the

79
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,580
DNA a cyber equivalents commanding
backfire

80
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,360
antivirus action no transferred

81
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:07,290
but in this case is wrong because I have
militias inside my fire at the second

82
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:14,079
situation I substitute hope parts of my
file we felt they needed my delicious

83
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,000
cold and this point no transfer

84
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,140
consider this is right or wrong because
in this case we have owned this case

85
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,779
attitude is wrong

86
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:44,750
not consider this is my trigger to
autoimmune disease again after this

87
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:52,440
contamination I have some effect of
violence in no way because I i put

88
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,589
inside the file a malicious code a cyber
equivalents any user five programs

89
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,790
operating system

90
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:08,599
antivirus actions are removed this fire
that's too drastic Antivirus is wrong

91
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:17,720
because I have a user file I user of the
system they needed problem that I remove

92
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:25,230
the fire and the last we have a cell
infected with a virus in the evils away

93
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:32,959
because I C 00 part of the content of
the file with family issues cold and

94
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:41,349
viral infections removing fire that's do
this right because I have issues only

95
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:50,529
malicious code how does marry in this
case this bacteria will guarantee a

96
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:59,339
camouflage protection I use only native
language in the operating system we can

97
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:07,139
use any part in militias generally I put
there are many malicious code

98
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:14,279
spread around the would gain a virus
select someone tires will be effect in

99
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:29,309
others not but in this point there is a
special effects oh dear drink anybody

100
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:44,108
here know what is now this is a virus
test-fired I E a car

101
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:47,359
are defined is a test

102
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:57,449
antivirals young power this is a devil
in strange that destroy viruses

103
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:07,410
destroyer system after this point after
contaminate the file antivirals act act

104
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:40,540
in destroy and remove the fire inside
the system

105
00:14:40,540 --> 00:15:40,420
what happens

106
00:15:40,420 --> 00:16:02,449
happens with cast in the $150 in the
same situation we use a idk seek our car

107
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:12,550
and is not detected this

108
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:29,589
apocalypse technique delete all files
inside the system in this point security

109
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:48,089
from hyde levels of mystery in the user
reviews knowledge about the trades is

110
00:16:48,089 --> 00:17:23,569
necessary to companies this

111
00:17:23,569 --> 00:18:01,480
we do I i found out on internet 108 80
companies virus company but the

112
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:13,279
government companies and people because
every every people use antivirus in

113
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:24,909
particular those companies use
government used to detect to to defend

114
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:27,210
against threats

115
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:33,710
senators and hash didn't find
distinguish appearance not in the

116
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,590
attitude just so after even in their
risky concept carries with it the

117
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:47,840
detection us even take indicators of
senators are stereotype threat in this

118
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:57,490
point we are you there is it or not if
you use Google Apps technique you cannot

119
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:04,870
use you vulnerable hundreds of that the
white i think is not no easy way out

120
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:18,268
because when the special technology is
vulnerable in the apocalypse technique

121
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:28,409
my conclusion sum up my my presentation
this is a book is present in the crate

122
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:37,929
space in a Muslim on the facebook
apocalypse russia and survivors

123
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:46,229
free to contact email Skype link ed

124
00:19:46,229 --> 00:20:07,009
questions from the media if you have a
question send them here I have a great

125
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:17,470
pleasure to respond about this questions
about the apocalypse

126
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:36,250
interesting method method from biology
in order to investigate malware and to

127
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,080
fix it

128
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:43,350
do you think that the answer lies in
this because the biologists work very

129
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:49,309
hard on this soon trying to remove
viruses from DNA do think this will help

130
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:54,149
us improve this month and we should do
work together with them

131
00:20:54,150 --> 00:21:02,409
share our resources I am I not a
biologist this is a metaphor to compare

132
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:12,490
the situation because they saw what
happens we need to do to construct the

133
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:24,000
base to base my my my tech my technique
is this

134
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:42,880
we only parts of our car your car to
last week all attendees I think because

135
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:53,510
there are some algorithms that might
help some methods for this i think i

136
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:59,330
think is a problem I'm products our

137
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:06,340
there are basically two that clogs
signatures and behavior approach but

138
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:16,158
behavior approach is used only in a
company not because the virus that we

139
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:24,710
tested our technology approach behavior
approach

140
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:36,830
activity I think the solution of softer
date indicators inside her computer and

141
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:49,370
sent to translate to a senators because
all the virus was still use it

142
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:59,059
approach behavior approach I don't know
why I think there are many algorithms

143
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:03,830
use it to to to trace

144
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,770
behavior of suppliers
