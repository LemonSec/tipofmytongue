1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,919
ok so first of all before we start I
usually take a picture of the crowd

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,489
before I start this is the first time
actually I'm going to have to take a

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:33,980
panoramic picture so let's let's try
that it's working

4
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:44,360
it's huge ok guided posted I'll send it
to you for innovators ok so my name is a

5
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,360
meat ax me this bill I work for check
marks I'm here today to talk about game

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,269
of hacks will go through some some
introduction about application security

7
00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:03,019
which is what we do check marks we do
static analysis will talk about what

8
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:09,670
game of hexes will understand also
what's behind game of had so it's not

9
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,100
only a game it's much more than that
will have a short game which I need your

10
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,720
participation so anyone who has wireless
mobile or laptop whatever get it ready

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,899
there's going to be a quiz and even
though we're giving out the T-shirts

12
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:32,280
outside give the winner an extra one if
we have time I'll talk a bit about

13
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,789
node.js which is the platform and
language that the framework that game

14
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:43,789
and taxes based on and of course at the
end we'll go out with some takeaways so

15
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:51,890
hopefully everything will work as
planned and let's start so well you see

16
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,970
at the moment is kind of what we're
talking about the problems so the

17
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:01,360
problem is people hacking into large
organizations in different means

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,539
different ways but the bigger problem
which is why security became such a big

19
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:11,280
thing is because it costs a lot of money
to these organizations you look for

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,959
example at Target just you know the
costs of the doubt data they lost was

21
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,400
160 162 million dollars just for the
data and then they have the lawsuits and

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,020
the reputation that they've lost in all
of that as as kind of cost them probably

23
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:34,450
a few hundreds of millions of dollars
with the OPM reach that was a few months

24
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,629
ago

25
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:40,660
5.6 million fingerprints were stolen so
it's not even password for user names or

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,109
things like that it's fingerprints no
fingerprints of official

27
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:52,050
American employees government employees
very very sensitive data obviously it

28
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,040
has a value in cash as well

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,769
Ashley Madison we all heard of this one
other than the fact that it's

30
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,400
embarrassing for a few people who were
caught red-handed there's again the

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,959
reputation the company was kind of being
asked to close down they didn't close

32
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,780
down but a lot of money was spent and
will be spent on fixing the problem that

33
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,520
happened due to the breach sony also
famous one not gonna go into too much

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,870
details about it but again

35
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,970
reputation profit last they they showed
the movie what was it the interview I

36
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,020
think it was called they put it on on
the internet for free instead of being

37
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:46,080
able to make money out of it and more
and more and more organizations that are

38
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:54,620
being hacked regularly and constantly
the thing is that it becomes more and

39
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:02,310
more obvious that breaches are occurring
on the level of the developments on the

40
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,160
level of the code if the code is not
perfect if the code is not protected no

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:17,180
firewall no endpoint protection nothing
can prevent a user logging on and you

42
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,829
know running an SQL injection if the
code is not sanitized it's not clean

43
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,460
it's not secure the half will always
happen and we're seeing that more and

44
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:37,090
more of the attacks are targeting the
application layer so check marks as I

45
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:44,799
said we do static analysis and static
analysis means having developers

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,530
involved in the security effort so it's
not only the security personnel that are

47
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,750
in charge of it it's not only the IP for
example installing fire walls and stuff

48
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,460
like that

49
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,989
but it's also the developers and what
triggered our idea was when we were at a

50
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,130
conference about a year ago a bit more
and we saw a bunch of people just like

51
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,380
you and me standing in front of a big
billboard and we came up closer and we

52
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,940
looked at it had something like this on
the screen there was no prize no nothing

53
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,050
no fame nothing at all they were just
standing there a bunch of developers

54
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,289
trying to figure out what the
vulnerability is that we understood it's

55
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,719
really interesting for them so there's
some kind of potential here on top of

56
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,150
that there are researchers and and
concerns by Cecil's which the main to

57
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,960
our the awareness and the training of
developers when it comes to security so

58
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,359
a lot of the seasons are becoming more
and more aware that developers have to

59
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:58,240
become part of this effort the security
effort we put these two together so the

60
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,630
guys looking to find a vulnerability and
the the awareness the research that was

61
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,469
publicized and we said ok let's do
something let's make something and we

62
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:18,030
created game of hawks game of hacks was
launched about August last year since

63
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:25,309
then we had hundreds of thousands this
presentation is a bit few months no not

64
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,340
if you must but it's a bit outdated more
than a hundred thousand games were

65
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,000
played since then by people who are
trying to test their coding skills

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,750
let's take a short look at game of hacks
and I hope the wireless is fine and this

67
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,789
is this is the idea of game of hex very
simple it's available online

68
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:51,389
www.cammodels.com you choose if you want
to play by yourself or against a friend

69
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:57,300
and then you can challenge a friend if I
play by myself I choose the level that I

70
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:07,219
wanna play let's have a vote who wants
beginner 123 don't be shy it's ok I'm

71
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,680
not going to be able to figure out the
beginner as well who wants intermediate

72
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,330
ok all the same command output beginner
on and let me know if anyone can get

73
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,979
this so you get a piece of code get a
piece of code on the screen and a second

74
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:33,050
there it is and you have to tell what
the vulnerability is if anyone wants to

75
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:46,830
guess the vulnerability as BHP and I
guess is if not I'll just choose any of

76
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:56,099
them held up injection correct ok this
is how it goes it continues so you have

77
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:03,479
55 questions I think each question has
few options of answers it becomes more

78
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,990
harder it becomes more interesting for
some people and it's actually a very

79
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,830
good way to educate developers to
educate security and people who are

80
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:20,469
developing applications but there was a
bit more behind that so game of hacks

81
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:26,800
was indeed kind of the same marketing
and awareness education tool but we said

82
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,510
ok we're gonna do something it's
probably going to attract akers' it's

83
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,289
probably going to track the black hat
guys who wanna show off so they're

84
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:42,330
better than than an eyesore than anyone
else so what we did was that we made a

85
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:47,750
honeypot out of it as well and our
assumption was completely correct and

86
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,410
very quickly we found out that people
were rather than playing the game and

87
00:08:52,410 --> 00:09:00,140
finding the vulnerabilities were hacking
attacks and that's okay because we left

88
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:06,120
it open on purpose we wrote the code in
a way that will allow vulnerabilities

89
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,240
and that will let people happy and show
off their skills so some of the things

90
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,270
that you can see people wrote on here

91
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,610
tries to teach security officials at
security

92
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,040
ironically it easy to hack a game about
finding security bugs and then someone

93
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,329
was clever enough to say maybe that was

94
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:32,388
the metagame so yes that was made a game
but not only a bit about the

95
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:42,399
architecture more boring no doubt sorry
democrats is based on node.js so we have

96
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,129
the client-side running on web browsers
mobile phones

97
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:51,129
iOS Android I must admit that I never
tried it on Windows but I'm guessing

98
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:57,249
it'll work anyone has a winner who has a
Windows Phone in here

99
00:09:57,249 --> 00:10:11,179
22 out of 345 wow six so we have not bad
impressive festive windows are happy

100
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:16,170
bill gates's will check next year again

101
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,729
ok so it runs on the client side on the
browser and then we have the node.js

102
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,329
architecture running on

103
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:29,359
hiroko with MongoDB which work very well
together usually in MongoDB in node.js

104
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,879
no jess is interesting it's been
catching up lately a lot

105
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:39,290
the reason for that is kind of because
it's very very good for web applications

106
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:46,129
for quick I'll functionality and this is
an explanation about how node.js works

107
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:52,529
quickly review it but I have a better
slide that is easier to explain the idea

108
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:58,449
is that the event loop is the brain of
the system it get constantly requests

109
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:03,939
from the event queue and it passes it on
to someone to do the work so the event

110
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:08,129
is the event handlers the file system
database network things like that

111
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:15,299
whenever the event loop itself has to do
a calculation it will do the calculation

112
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,279
of want to anything else until it
finishes that which is the bedsit side

113
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,910
of node.js so it's very sleepy it's not
good for CPU intensive applications a

114
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,279
better way to explain that is this

115
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:37,470
so you have a fast food restaurant you
have the single thread which is the

116
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,110
event loop the the handler at the event
loop itself and then you have the event

117
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,249
handlers which are the people who are
getting the tests bring the coke bring

118
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:49,329
their hamburger bring me tries bring
anything like that and the guide the

119
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:54,939
cashier which is constantly getting
requests from the line from the from the

120
00:11:54,939 --> 00:12:01,899
year what we call the event queue is
always free to take more event more

121
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:07,540
tasks however if you give him something
difficult all of the people in the line

122
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:14,550
won't get their food probably okay so
that's node.js and that the platform

123
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,019
that we used for a game of hats again
looking at game of had two different

124
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:24,379
entities and you'll see along the line
why I'm talking about this there's the

125
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:29,540
difficulty level which is marked at the
top the score that you're gaining

126
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,629
there's the timer sixty second timer the
question of course the answers and the

127
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:39,300
code snippet itself these are all the
different parts of game of hacks where

128
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:48,420
all of them of course our target for
hackers to attack so what did people do

129
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:56,969
what did we get out of this honey part
what did hackers try to do so

130
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:03,009
players or hackers or just people who
are accessing the website they the game

131
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:08,250
we're able to figure out that you can
send the same answer on the same

132
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:17,259
question many times and someone wrote
here so he writes Alex here after

133
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:20,920
getting a question correct you can
submit the same post requests with the

134
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,449
same answer and very large negative
number for the time I imagine they're

135
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:30,800
just adding your newly calculated score
30 miners time to your session previous

136
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,050
score and then at the end he says a
lesson it's sanitizing inputs is right

137
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,040
and that was possible

138
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,019
so what we did once we found once we
detected that someone found that

139
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,320
vulnerability that we left in there we
added a question already answered flag

140
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,380
on the server side another thing that
people did was play around with the time

141
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,519
or the time was calculated on the
client-side calculating a timer on the

142
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,970
client's sorry but it's plain stupid
people were stopping the timer answering

143
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,519
the question then sending their own
their own time that they decided in many

144
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:17,079
cases they sent a negative number so
minus 999 999 999 and that calculation

145
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:23,939
gave them a score as highest possible
because of our calculation so what's the

146
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,110
solution for that very simple where
should we calculate calculate the time

147
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:37,250
on the server side and yes there is some
kind of network influence but it's very

148
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:45,910
very minor and it's negligible in this
type of application another nice thing

149
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,279
that happened and this one this one is
not one that we put in and purpose I

150
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:54,519
still don't know how to explain it but
its iOS no one knows how to explain iOS

151
00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:02,440
so someone found that if you plan on iOS
and you put your finger on the screen

152
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,430
the time or stops so that was also a
trick that someone was hacking hacking

153
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:14,519
the heck they called it and now I want
everyone to take out their cell phones

154
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,100
or something that you can browse
internet we're gonna have a game it's

155
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,399
fun not gonna have any of you I'm not a
hacker just wearing a black hat someone

156
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,329
gave it to me

157
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:36,339
let's go so I'm going to launch the game
you're going to get a pin code on the

158
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:57,999
screen if you go to Kohout . I T is the
sound working volume yeah anything I see

159
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:07,189
people starting to join its good I did
this at I did this at DEFCON we had more

160
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:26,589
than a hundred players so let's see if
we can break break that I like my small

161
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:32,640
goats

162
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:43,140
Sevigny who hasn't join are we supposed
to hear the sound on the speakers around

163
00:16:43,140 --> 00:17:11,109
it'd be much nicer if we can it's coming
from here at the moment here this or how

164
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:21,530
do I switch to speakers or headphones

165
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:27,680
I don't know when those too complicated
nevermind we'll do it without musical al

166
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,040
saying okay we have a hundred and
fourteen terrorism gonna start now

167
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,480
there's still time to join so don't
worry

168
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,490
gonna ask you a question the beginning
we're gonna have two or three questions

169
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,940
just so you get the idea of it first
question no points is everyone

170
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,500
comfortable in their seats have a colors
choose your colors and it's really sad

171
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,960
that we don't have the music it has
really cool

172
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:22,020
adds to the atmosphere I know I know
playback device this one set as default

173
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:31,940
you know sound ok give it one minute
just much nicer when you have some music

174
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,430
in the background that way I don't feel
embarrassed ending here on stage

175
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:41,309
completely silent

176
00:18:41,309 --> 00:19:04,450
ranged from the TV

177
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:20,539
ok let's continue anyway I mean we don't
waste your time last chance to join if

178
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,100
everyone hasn't joined yet how many
participants to have their say on their

179
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:42,668
oh ok bit better answers five more
seconds we're gonna get a bit more

180
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,029
serious in a second

181
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:47,240
nice

182
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:55,080
ok don't worry it happens everywhere

183
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:06,050
ok next question what about this one now
ok I'm just kidding just getting will

184
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,629
skip this one okay now we're starting
seriously we're gonna have some code on

185
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,309
the screen

186
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:17,629
we're gonna have some code on screen I
hope it'll be a show properly it's gonna

187
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:33,210
give you it's like ok same format and
let's go

188
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:48,660
beginner level so I want at least 60
percent correct answers then more

189
00:20:48,660 --> 00:21:00,770
seconds you don't know just get a ride
at sea

190
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:07,040
ok ok that's reasonable considering the
fact that not everyone here is a

191
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:16,420
developer I hope next one another one
another piece of vulnerability in the

192
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,290
code

193
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:52,960
I don't know the answer by the way nice
very nice ok let's go on going to see

194
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,890
some questions about game effects as
well but before that extra points which

195
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:08,480
one is Tom it's different in every
country by the way some people are

196
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:16,140
obvious and other countries it's not
that clear and now of course we have

197
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,790
everyone answer at a hundred and
forty-five nice very nice it's a it's

198
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:30,230
it's a tomcat ok tom cat some of you
know tom cat rights patchy things like

199
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,680
that

200
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:39,400
ok let's move on and I have honor bility
I think that's the last vulnerability

201
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,390
after that we have some questions about
game of facts about what we talked about

202
00:22:42,390 --> 00:23:12,220
this one is supposed to be a bit more
difficult

203
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:22,309
how many answers did we get that someone
notice not going to calculate all of

204
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:34,850
that more than a hundred ok ok I don't
know how to pronounce that SEC of nice

205
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:46,620
going and MDN as a doctor in the nice
going ok so this one is really regarding

206
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:54,350
the game of hacks question so if we
randomized the answer order what's a

207
00:23:54,350 --> 00:24:12,219
problem if we randomized it on the
client I give you a little time for this

208
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,780
next time I'll give you some more
several will know the correct answer of

209
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,950
course if the client randomized is
there's no way for the server to

210
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:27,809
understand what the correct answer is we
talked about this one who should be

211
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:42,918
validating the answer correctness 100%
ready is the answer

212
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:55,359
should be a hundred 4545 before yeah
that was a hundred percent right so it's

213
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:08,509
obviously the server has to go through
that one piece of node.js code anyone

214
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:35,499
can recognize the problem here that was
a problem we discussed initially not

215
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:37,639
many more

216
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:41,459
that's the last one before another one
that just interesting for my curiosity

217
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:47,889
we had that calculation of the score 60
time to answer a difficulty which

218
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:54,258
parameters would be easiest to break and
I showed you the answer to that in the

219
00:25:54,259 --> 00:26:05,890
presentation itself

220
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:19,990
alright I'm to answer correct very nice
ok last question no points just out of

221
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:27,130
my curiosity because of what we do check
marks you don't answer you don't have to

222
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:46,330
but I really like to know the
percentages I'm guessing some of you use

223
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,210
more than one some of you don't use any
of these some of you do manual testing

224
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:55,780
but there was just out of my curiosity
and it's interesting to see that you

225
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:01,430
have more more static analysis and
dynamic analysis that's as good as smart

226
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,740
even though I think you need both of
them at the end of the day

227
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,760
ok so we're done with the game now comes
the om-d

228
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,040
sorry guys I'll give you both t-shirts
and if you all come to the booth I'll

229
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,520
give all of you t-shirts so was not
worth the effort

230
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:27,740
ok so going back to the presentation

231
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,540
we're talking about node.js know this is
the difficult part of the presentation

232
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,030
for me but they have to try and make a
demo work and it usually doesn't work

233
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:40,230
but we were talking about node.js the
platform is based on node.js the fact

234
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:48,360
that no jess is not good for CPU
intensive functionality and remember

235
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,959
this single thread the guy at the
cashier he can't do stuff that requires

236
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:02,190
him to think thinking is not good you
have to take and pass it on if you think

237
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:08,090
you delay everyone else no one gets
their food so we found this so what we

238
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,509
found we wrote this small piece of code

239
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:15,059
with an attempt to cause a denial of
service

240
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:22,289
gonna follow you know seinfeld is
seinfeld so no soup for you so denial of

241
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:25,989
service this small piece of code
actually take the number one and number

242
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:31,809
P calculates the sum of the numbers
together so it's a CPU intensive task in

243
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:36,969
case the number is big and the number of
small obviously it's smaller and I'll

244
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:43,399
show you how it works in a demo and what
the problem is this is going to be

245
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,539
difficult

246
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,940
ok we see the full screen

247
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:57,269
yeah okay so what we're actually doing
now is running the script in on a web

248
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:07,019
browser so if we look at the end of this
URL code your line you'll see that at

249
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:15,159
the moment it's calculating until the
number one so easy it's one and you also

250
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,699
saw that when I collected it came up
very quickly

251
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:25,899
want now what I'm gonna do sometimes
crashes my computer so hope that this

252
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:33,738
time I'll change this one in 25 so it
should be 15 the answer if I'm not

253
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:38,440
mistaken and I'll change this one into
ten million

254
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:49,240
1234567 what do you think is going to
happen if I run both of them together

255
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:58,860
wifi run-first the 10 million and then
the five anyone sorry so it won't crash

256
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:06,219
them up well unless my crash them if I
really did a denial of service act on it

257
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,860
was too heavy for the task but what will
happen and I hope that I'll be able to

258
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:16,008
show it to you is that the ten thousand
ten million the calculation is very

259
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:21,110
heavy so it's gonna take up the full CPU
have quad-core on here it's going to

260
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:28,209
take up 25% of the CPU and it wont let
the smaller calculation come in before

261
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,149
it complete ok so let me try it out

262
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:44,350
gonna click enter here was a bit fast
they had another 10 it'll be probably or

263
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:49,678
maybe I shouldn't at the orcas and I'll
crash it so let's try this

264
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:59,059
told you that was the hard part of the
presentation see now it took a bit

265
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:03,799
longer so it won't that the idea that
I'm trying to show is being gentle

266
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,860
because it's my laptop them more the
larger the number will be the more time

267
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,620
it will take to do the calculation the
more time we're taking up the resources

268
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,559
the CPU resource and the event loop the
node.js won't be able to continue doing

269
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,779
anything else is the idea is very simple
to run denial of service on a node.js

270
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:29,100
application if no one did any
sanitization or validation on the fields

271
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,490
themself

272
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:39,480
ok another thing about node.js which is
interesting OJS usually works very well

273
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:48,620
with MongoDB the reason for that is that
node.js is kind of naturally adapted to

274
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:55,639
to Jason and MongoDB is naturally
adapted to be a kind of don't know how

275
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,179
you call it a document database it's not
it's not table based and they both work

276
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:08,059
together very well so again without
proper validation someone can send out a

277
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:15,260
node.js a Jason query string that the
MongoDB will translate and be able to

278
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:21,760
either run an SQL injection without SQL
which is another demo that I don't have

279
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:29,809
time to show today or you can also use
regex and as we all know regulates is

280
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:36,610
very heavy on the CPU so again if there
is no validation on there someone can

281
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:47,490
run a huge group regulates like this one
for example and crashed the system again

282
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:56,000
let me see if I can do that

283
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:16,310
it's not letting me login of course the
right credentials but if I open up task

284
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:31,360
manager and you take a look at the CPU
here goes up to 25% immediately by

285
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,790
MongoDB if there are no longer reggae
acts which again I'm avoiding because

286
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,909
it's my laptop i dont wanna crash my
laptop now not in the middle of

287
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:47,820
presentation it would block the whole
CPU for a longer time of course so

288
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,870
that's what we call Greg X denial of
service it's something that has been

289
00:33:53,870 --> 00:34:04,189
research and has been discussed in the
past for an OG earth a few takeaways so

290
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:10,830
why was I talking about gains what's the
whole point here so I started at the

291
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,929
beginning by mentioning that we believe
that developers should be part of the

292
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:21,040
security effort in each organization for
developing code the first step has to be

293
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,350
that the code is secure the way for the
best way in my opinion and this is how

294
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:36,668
we actually execute our product is to
make it interesting

295
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:41,580
make it easy for developers developers
wanted development get rid of the code

296
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:47,340
and you know passed QA and that's it but
if you want them to do security also you

297
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,960
have to bring them in you have to get
there there you have to get them to want

298
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,870
to do security so it has to be
interesting

299
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:01,670
easy to do and a lot of it and a lot of
education today is around gamification

300
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,690
so whenever you can game if I your
education

301
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:13,650
do that you can use game of hacks it's
on the web for free at kmart.com

302
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:22,970
regarding usage of code of course don't
think I need to say that here but

303
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:30,480
validate input length validate the input
in general you have to study each

304
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,210
language each language has its own
pitfalls for example node.js has the CPU

305
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,599
issue it has the Jason string issues
that have to be that developers have to

306
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,530
be aware of

307
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:47,700
learn the language that you're
developing learn its problems burns

308
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:57,240
learn its pitfalls mentioned OJS CPU
intensive and that is more or less it

309
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:07,560
unless there are questions questions I
asked a lot of questions yeah the source

310
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,890
code for for the demos I can send you
that I think I can send you that I'll

311
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,020
check with our with our developers in
internally if you wanna you wanna give

312
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,329
me a business card or stop by the booth
later on give me your email anymore

313
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:35,319
questions how should I be insulted or
was a very clear

314
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:43,319
okay thank you very much oh wait
question no class is there any way to do

315
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:48,400
you like distributed denial of service
attack directly from the chrome dev

316
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,609
tools for example from sorry directly
from the chrome dev tools

317
00:36:54,609 --> 00:37:00,799
good question good question I'm not sure
I don't know that I am I must admit I

318
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:08,319
don't know the answer and not a security
code ur so I can check that again is

319
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:12,890
there any possibility to you bypass I
don't know chrome filters and there is

320
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:19,069
with us directly from the chrome dev
tools for talking about chrome there's

321
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:24,788
or Firefox deficits I don't want to so
we can check that off line not sure

322
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:32,309
about I don't think I can give you a
straight answer right now we have time

323
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:43,509
for 20 questions ok I'll make it an easy
one

324
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:52,150
what's your name and how do you generate
the code snippets on the game so it's

325
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,489
actually it's actually a cool thing
first of all we collected a lot of code

326
00:37:55,489 --> 00:38:01,930
snippets by ourselves and we put him on
there but later on we allowed customers

327
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,410
and people think the game to send us
code snippets as well that they found

328
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,720
what what happens with a lot of our
customers is that well it's an

329
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,439
interesting story some of our customers
actually asked to have the game of hacks

330
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,930
as part of their as part of our product
in their organization so not a public

331
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:25,169
one but a game where their developers
can test the code in static analysis and

332
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,489
then when they 55 problems they can
share that on the game of hacks and the

333
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:33,779
other developers will learn from it
again educational very important we were

334
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,599
thinking of doing that we might do that
in the future

335
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,109
it's it's an interesting approach but we
collect code snippets from anyone who

336
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:46,060
wants to share them thank you

337
00:38:46,060 --> 00:39:02,100
have researchers distributed sort of
game when I asked the players to align

338
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:08,100
DNA sequences in order to find the genes
responsible for certain diseases or

339
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:14,569
something like that and it helped them
further their research because a lot of

340
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:20,750
players did what their computers could
do so did you would you consider doing

341
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,630
using game of hacks to do this so so I
think that part of what we did with game

342
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,180
of hacks it's not exactly similar to
what you're describing and and first of

343
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,779
all I agree with you know the more
people you have looking at something the

344
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,310
more information you get obviously but
what we did with game of house was we on

345
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,170
purpose

346
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:46,850
caused it to be vulnerable which gave us
more information about it of course I

347
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:53,770
didn't I'm and the code snippets of code
snippets within the game

348
00:39:53,770 --> 00:40:03,080
yes you get more opinions and yeah we
are getting we're getting constantly

349
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,490
more snippets from different developers
globally I think that if we go to the

350
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:15,720
game itself just try to I think there's
an option to send

351
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:23,169
or maybe you could feature instead of
just choosing the vulnerability other

352
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:31,670
comment sorry I do feature instead of on
top of choosing the vulnerability maybe

353
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:36,260
you could add a comment about the code
ok yeah there's a lot of stuff that we

354
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,960
want to add to the to the game there is
stuff like you know how would you solve

355
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,030
the vulnerability what's the best way to
solve the vulnerability and things like

356
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:52,140
what you mentioned and this is the first
screen on the on the page you can also

357
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,230
submit your own code with the answers of
course so that's something that we have

358
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,859
the developer community participate with
us but yeah I agree there is a lot more

359
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:07,109
that we can do and we will thank you

360
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:18,509
okay thank you very much thank you so
much
