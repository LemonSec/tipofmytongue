1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:07,459
ok My Name Is Khan injury I used to work
in police forensic spot then I came to

2
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:12,610
my senses and I went to the mall banking
involving myself in a security and end

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,900
the stations I have some more
experienced an estate here like passing

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,348
ISS PE exam bodies but what is really
important is that I was always

5
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:30,109
interested in helping to all digital
transmissions that I was able since my

6
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:43,050
first Commodore 64 and I mentioned we
will be talking about practical

7
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,089
approaches I see more people are coming

8
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:57,180
what we are seeing here is WPA handshake
this is all very interesting but what is

9
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:04,260
important is that a society that
broadcasters name on the network is

10
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,260
taking part in the encryption what that
means that you cannot effectively use

11
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,060
rainbow tables in cracking GSM wifi this
is not like GSM rainbow tables 2

12
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,150
terabytes for cracker

13
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:30,290
if you have two networks with different
network names and the same password the

14
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,549
output the harsh will be different

15
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:40,930
saw you cannot use and used applications
they are some rainbow tables for given

16
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:47,700
their network names like the Linksys or
Dlink forgiven space but they're not

17
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,570
used because its effectiveness marginal
sea

18
00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:04,520
we see a logic about around to
authentication what is important here is

19
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:14,810
start cracking WPA we need to have a
handshake and two we can of course wait

20
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,310
for trying to reconnect on at work but
we also can force it to the out

21
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,790
integrate I am by the yeltsin taking the
altercation we mean sending fortune

22
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,179
information to access point that climbed
wishes to cease the connection at this

23
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,090
point accepted and the connections and
then the driver of a client tries to

24
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:48,660
reconnect the handshake the place and we
have this is basic package I have a lot

25
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,239
of this equipment but I've decided to
show the old one PCMC crowd is a proxy

26
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,070
war in the cold version at the time it
was worth a few hundred doors now it's

27
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,530
worthless few years ago I wanted to you
put it to good use by the cartridge was

28
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:14,350
not able to catch the handshake came out
that it was conducted on its home that

29
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:22,109
capability saw your hardware hardware
must be up-to-date example of that is up

30
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:28,850
to date itself occurred on the right one
but it does have its weaknesses like

31
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:34,910
problems in Long captures nice handling
and power consumption

32
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:42,859
right top we have to be saying this is
very cheap or alter its very good for

33
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:49,130
open them you're a teen but we will take
a look in a minute on the left we have

34
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:56,090
almost the same functionality but with
battery on board I saw some can say that

35
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,770
it is very useful but I've never took
advantage of it we have also reaching on

36
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:10,050
them and is microSD card this is very
important to us talk about it later and

37
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:17,440
the flashlight this might seem silly
outfits but I spent much time looking

38
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,500
for higher capacity flash drive that
will be fast enough to serve as a swap

39
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,310
file and at the same time

40
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,780
USB 20 standard none of the tested by me

41
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:42,690
Reuters way on the to boot from flash
drive USB 30 so doesn't exist and here

42
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,710
we have opened annually teen

43
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:54,030
simple reuter this is very basic that
very useful

44
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:00,859
operating system it's safe for normal
and we can install it

45
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:09,710
store on it almost everything here we
have a window with connected a rotor on

46
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:19,549
wot running I don't dampen G here we are
gathering all informations chance we can

47
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:27,120
of course said its particular settings
like only cultural given network name or

48
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,870
china or client as we can see here we
have only WP to this is a random

49
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:44,920
building so we can completely forgot
about WIP we see that works here here

50
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:53,850
that are exchanging data networks can be
our targets for fast the authentication

51
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:06,210
so we can have our have four decryption
after spent some years

52
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,739
wifi your wish to have some more
information about the environment and

53
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,810
network to clients how they connect we
can use free tools sign on that

54
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,420
presentation that will come today they
will show your some of the two graphs

55
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:29,250
charts this is a serious what are some
of those solutions and it's free

56
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:37,080
except the connections that are
currently taking place we can see also

57
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:45,789
the chickens so we can also see the
clients that

58
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:52,580
call for a network that is remembered
this is this can be undrawn fuck why

59
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:59,320
because your device is remembering that
works that is connected in the past

60
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,730
song without any forensic investigation
it can be proved that your device was

61
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:13,180
connecting to a neighbor's network you
can also ask your fiancee after going

62
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,730
back home conference why her hard work
he saw his homeland is trying to connect

63
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:31,490
now some math this is important as it
will be evident password entropy brute

64
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:38,080
forcing her password way if we even
considering it important one of the

65
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:48,099
major wifi internet internet provider
he's giving you are under US most of

66
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,360
these with your own unique networking
this is very good not only to identify

67
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,630
your network but also as we learned for
the security purposes we we cannot reuse

68
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,550
and their calculation that we are how
far the mates for other networks but

69
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:13,860
they use the passwords in very wrong way
they use only

70
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:24,740
this this upper upper case on the eight
character aspects so this is absolutely

71
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,400
not accepted by them will be a lawyer
you can have on the numbers

72
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:38,039
eight numbers and and ready and this
this entropy is exactly this this is the

73
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:48,480
number off possible combination that may
be on such data and this example we have

74
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:57,950
very outdated Radeon 6850 this is not
produced any more this is worth $40 and

75
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:10,610
it is unable two hundred Mortal Kombat
but it does generate $0.49 second this

76
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:20,060
is this is much more down secure we
don't use CPUs for cracking ask you can

77
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:28,800
see a three-point freaking harshest
their second versus 49 killer lashes on

78
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:39,660
outdated $40 radio about about the
process of cracking sings this is one

79
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,990
way and Christian / so we are trying all
possible combinations too much they're

80
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:55,630
all too harsh and when we will find it
it will point out the proper input

81
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:02,870
at this point I'm sure that everybody's
thinking what called minor can give us

82
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:11,470
well its example would you be seen we
will have all possible combinations in

83
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,170
two days

84
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:22,130
99% chance that you will have to pass
work to any UTC access point in two days

85
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:35,279
this is an entropy saw statistics

86
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:42,249
when you have a little farm you have
your passport in one day and in example

87
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:46,110
of outdated equipment we have 26 days

88
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:59,120
ok believe that this was not prepared
for this presentation this password

89
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,809
entropy in the weird really this is a
live example we have your PC access

90
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:17,300
point we have this outdated the radio on
us we spoke before 49 per second

91
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:28,639
we have time here and the password was
found not in 52 days nothing 2069 hours

92
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:37,839
are Swartz starting with a you have to
understand that I'm not targeting a

93
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,559
particular in this is another example of
broadband broadband provider that uses

94
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:52,649
security very wrong way and we also
speak about this later what what would

95
00:11:52,649 --> 00:12:06,170
happen if we were just 11 sign to our
pass phrase we will not have 8900 still

96
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:15,520
26 + face this is almost two years for
single modern

97
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:26,030
and for our little farm 49 characters in
this phase we have 52 days exactly the

98
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:32,569
same amount exactly the same time US
eight character passport for outdated

99
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:41,370
radio when we are approaching access
point

100
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:51,350
Access Point name like Kate network home
something like this we need to approach

101
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,070
it differently we know that there is a
high possibility that the user actually

102
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:06,670
made his own passport and we cannot
approach this access points with our

103
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:14,719
equipment because pass phrase of 1010
the characters like beyond our

104
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:23,840
hard-working people so this is this is
an example of pollution woman's name

105
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:35,370
this this is in the very basic polish
worries and well people are more than we

106
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:42,290
are led to believe they don't put some
simple passwords hinder access points

107
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:48,520
they make for example of his character a
capital letter because they were forced

108
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:55,010
to do so in other web applications and
they used their password for the Arts

109
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:02,540
I'm number or other number and the
special all of these this year we can

110
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:12,930
generate using such rules we can see
here and I am i doing in the world East

111
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:25,020
and signs posted before after special
changing their case and we have a sample

112
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:32,510
from storm database is public publicly
available for quite some time I've

113
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,660
underlying

114
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:42,389
streams that are present in the very
basic polish or English worries as you

115
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:53,069
can see here using such Charles we can
defeat on Muslim disposables so this is

116
00:14:53,069 --> 00:15:03,329
exploitation of the week pointing all
security implementation which is how we

117
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:12,939
can generate passwords missiles ready to
sign up but we can easily very easily

118
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:22,629
write our own software and well try to
remember that you can't save all this

119
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:29,240
output from the store store had
destroyed because the output with be

120
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,829
much bigger down and drive country of
Abel's saw the best way will be 2 feet

121
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:40,529
output from shut such talk directly to
for example hash code which is in my

122
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:50,810
opinion the best they're cutting tools
for that as we said this won't be as

123
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:56,079
easy as we can see here by we will be
not able to directly approach our victim

124
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:03,329
and ask for password but with very
little effort we will be able to figure

125
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,680
out how the password is generated

126
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:15,099
at this point I'm sure that all of you
know how to generate your own past faces

127
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:24,040
when poor design meets for
implementation because of its design

128
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:33,069
flaw we have on the 11,000 possible
combinations WPS perhaps from the

129
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:41,890
beginning and WPS is system and that was
that was designed in order to help the

130
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:49,640
users which are which are the problems
finding the passwords saw someone figure

131
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,230
out when will make up as a backup

132
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:02,959
user will have his your life when we
normally theoretically when you push

133
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:13,050
about we enter up incorrectly on all up
the access point were sent in plain text

134
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:22,669
it's pass phrase so what we need is only
correct this being were always being

135
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:28,920
within this 11,000 possible combinations

136
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:41,780
day at their access BIOS there we're
ready for checking all the possible

137
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:49,000
combinations from the moment they were
start that saw access point just waited

138
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,540
for the right and you could just played
the River Wey waited up to four hours

139
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,320
and newhart 1% assurance that you will
get that password

140
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:10,080
no matter how long or how difficult it
was this was fixed dates around to

141
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:17,919
January 2015 and the standard lease for
a few years with us

142
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,600
wish other

143
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:31,000
equipment like to be doing we had
problems that this time that we didn't

144
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:40,000
need to know about them to to make the
access point already 44 assuming it was

145
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:49,200
not protected against brute forcing and
some of them so much problems that even

146
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:58,070
if you will disable the WPS from their
weapon know it was all available

147
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:08,510
ok it's it's it's two walks and so what
were what we need to do is to patch

148
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:17,890
patch patch and assembly is the best way
back to open them working this is

149
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,289
awesome

150
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:24,000
of the hardware compatibility time I can
tell you that this stable you so long

151
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,710
that your Realtor is also compatible
with it and I am pleased to have to

152
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,760
tested

153
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:42,200
reuter running 15 you have the machine
you have someone on there

154
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:50,580
information about secure and so on and
what we are seeing here is flash drive

155
00:19:50,580 --> 00:20:00,639
capacity we can also hear a swap if the
memories not now for application but

156
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,490
usually when you just call or network
there is no need for that and of course

157
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:15,880
this flash drive must be fast enough to
handle another case it's usually for

158
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:24,410
misuse ruthlessness and we have all
tools that you would normally use on

159
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:31,900
your laptop on other such a distribution
week we all can all over it

160
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:42,980
install on your open wot ruler and use
it with with with battery with 3G modem

161
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:54,470
more than that it's microSD slot serving
us are high capacity and drive you can

162
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:02,010
execute one haha you can be far away
from the actual range of WiFi after

163
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:09,550
target of network you can still work on
it you can sneak the chafee you can run

164
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:15,510
looking for VPS you can do almost
everything and if you are starting to

165
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:21,890
use turning onto the screen you either
know it's already on you and this is

166
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,030
important

167
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:33,420
ok this is US producer said all what we
need to execute man-in-the-middle attack

168
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:47,840
we can also make a proxy for network
down special you like when we are in

169
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,730
network of the wormhole

170
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:57,190
using you to remotely and the other
access we can execute more sophisticated

171
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,250
attack from from social engineering
talking but today won't have time for

172
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:11,360
this and when we are on the Big Ten
Network we sometimes want to access

173
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:20,120
administrative gonna we can do this this
is easiest way to to use the device

174
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:35,639
software normal clinics we can use
companies are strictly display but in

175
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,440
case of administrative the usual length
of mean that displays as he's very short

176
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:49,169
because people tend to not change the
passwords to the panel to be afraid to

177
00:22:49,169 --> 00:23:02,210
yours and yes if we have problems with
the passphrase for now they are they

178
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:11,929
Reuters actually a lawyer to execute
commands on the root account without

179
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:18,790
importing and password will quiet there
is a bunch of examples and you can also

180
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:26,480
in some cases download flash from the
song you can

181
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:39,590
and pocket and look for harsh or just
plain text bending under this woman

182
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:47,889
bleeding was used one you know important
we had a lot of long that changes the

183
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,890
DNS

184
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:57,780
Ruto's and what he did actually just
changing tienes you play with your

185
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,799
internet without any problems you are
singing on you all your request a copy

186
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:11,668
of Simple DNS however when you are when
you want to connect or online banking is

187
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:25,370
this is redirecting your time fakes and
again if you are thinking about testing

188
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,939
such attack

189
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,520
we need to do something with this
certificate

190
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:39,399
well in practice sometimes there is no
human approving

191
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:44,609
the particles certificate and this is
done automatically and even if there is

192
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:54,399
you can always change the content after
you guided we only need to be green the

193
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:59,518
domain is not so important

194
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:05,899
wifi wifi everywhere we can look for
vulnerabilities everywhere one you know

195
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:16,959
it was a very popular to exploit the
vulnerability intelligent life again you

196
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:24,719
can gain access to network TV or
something to look for its very

197
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:32,649
interesting but not not only wrong
implementation issues sometimes we can

198
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:40,689
you stand outs new options here we have
example of quite an amount for each

199
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:51,639
standart and this is a new addition it
will cement tomb at possibility for

200
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:59,299
rotor to ask for silence when
advertising its networking song of

201
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:02,369
course week we can use it towards us

202
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:10,129
silence for victims Reuters and force
the user to make a factory reset just in

203
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:17,478
case his passport was too strong for us
we can constantly dealt indicate this

204
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:28,379
client but this is very noisy everybody
see it's it's it's it's locked in such a

205
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:34,918
retirement and quite an amount to my
knowledge it's not you can see on it

206
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:41,020
down not automatic was looking for it
even

207
00:26:41,020 --> 00:27:00,370
IPS or something like this so any
questions regarding cracking yes it

208
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:06,360
would be possible to use USB between
miners to crack the hash and what do you

209
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,939
do when you don't have any traffic on
the network

210
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:20,440
besides your indication attacks ok the
first question when you are by minors on

211
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,220
you as being reprogrammed they are
making factory to solve on

212
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,779
for political purposes

213
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:38,479
we cannot reprogram it this is not a
Spartan like to you can you Spartans but

214
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,849
they are very expensive

215
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:47,968
this is like programmable minor when
there is no traffic and we are when we

216
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:54,250
are dealing with wp8 this might be a
little problem however we can check

217
00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:05,670
WPS this is first and well we can the
particular network article networking

218
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:13,430
and channel you have no problems in our
own time and this in a few weeks and you

219
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:18,710
have 100 percent chance that someone
will connect if the access point exactly

220
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:32,920
I hope to answer any other questions
really everything was clear thank you so

221
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,690
much thank you
