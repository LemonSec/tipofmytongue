1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,610
ok I'll stack for hackers so first of
all who is a heckler this year or maybe

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:19,740
she reaches guy who Steph XLIV trying to
solve the problem in a unique way you

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:29,689
know I guess he has 99 99 percent chance
of stopping characters but personally I

4
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:35,820
think hackers are about connecting the
dots they know how to connect the dots

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,600
they know how to think out of the box
and disarmament features of hackers but

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,410
first comes first for my security
consultant at

7
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:54,250
we are a small but little company when
it comes to breaking in like there's

8
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:00,210
racial testing social engineering are
most street dance in their camp this is

9
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,490
the picture from 2013 were Milan garber
I don't know if you can see him in the

10
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:15,339
corner we presented elk steak for
hackers both how to analyze and the

11
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,259
republication in a dynamically way
basically region between games mostly

12
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:27,350
and should be here instead of me but
sorry you need to stick with me but I

13
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:34,548
promise I will give you some valuable
information so like hackers do now let's

14
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:39,880
try to connect the dots first of all
what is out stack it stands for

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:48,970
elasticsearch look station commander and
elk steak is usually used for event

16
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,220
monitoring for example if you have
computer network you want to know what

17
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:01,039
is happening on the network but we are
using toxic in kind of different way we

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,710
use it to put wifi data into the Arctic
and visualize and see maybe some strange

19
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,869
patterns because

20
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,879
if you know big data is all about
patterns and I will show you that when

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:38,940
I'm talking about wi-fi date I can talk
about big computer and their flocks and

22
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:57,120
she and reach and after that do data is
transferred to elasticsearch what is

23
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,409
elastic search you can say it's
distributed search engine for example

24
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:07,590
but it's a lot of more it's useful
storage and also for his grieving they

25
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,120
had them on top of it is cabana

26
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:18,389
nice kind of the Crary engine queries
Dallas and displays the data and

27
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:26,410
beautiful graphs you can have a lot of
stuff I'll show you later so just

28
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:33,069
shooting some big data according to
Wikipedia information privacy is one of

29
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:36,138
the challengers and why is that

30
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:43,299
let me explain I read an article about
that smart people prefer curly fries

31
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:50,049
what has curly fries do much more people
actually not think I try to either the

32
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:57,859
party it turned out that killed
ambassador was so but what they did they

33
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:05,889
can't alter experiment on Facebook and
based on the likes of these colic in the

34
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:12,010
first row with smart he tends to connect
with all other smart people because we

35
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:20,560
like to connect and share ideas with the
same people as we are so after he liked

36
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,039
curly fries it turned out that other
France that are also smart like Earth

37
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:33,130
rice and you can imagine our river
flowing and the aunt you turned out the

38
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:40,620
smart people like reference what has
distributed information privacy you see

39
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:48,830
based on the likes they can tell or
classify your for example they can tell

40
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:56,539
if you are terrorists or if you get a
great I don't know just likes so next

41
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:03,010
time if you like something conveys
building twice as already pointed out

42
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,909
metadata sexual activity reports and
then again I ask him how many times you

43
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,740
need to retreat and tweets to become on
the list on the Raider and he replied

44
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,539
the only once so I did it twice

45
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:27,900
not to become one on the radar but
here's another example of big data

46
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:35,400
anybody seen this this is what she was
actually pretty good at jeopardy he beat

47
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,229
two state championships

48
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:44,539
dude overall champions of jeopardy and
he was able to recognize natural

49
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:51,210
language and for the knowledge think he
he had more than four terabytes of data

50
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:57,940
structures on structure it basically the
whole Wikipedia so you can think in

51
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,520
terms of big data like there is
knowledge behind it

52
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:11,389
your family over the screen this is the
output of our dumping she has little set

53
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,060
of our crack and is used mainly

54
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:22,830
and monitoring by Friday and so on so
many of you use aircrack NGU ok the

55
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:34,130
right audience but what has to do big
data with five are actually a lot to set

56
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:41,020
up the health sector hackers and it's a
monitoring and office we have been we

57
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,240
are in the dance floor and monitor about
two weeks and this is a number of

58
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:55,110
records 25 millions so you can talk when
you talk about wi-fi he can talk about

59
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,530
them for hackers about that

60
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,830
else like we at the era dumping G to
this image and we have doubts that for

61
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:17,229
hikers but I would like to do some
hands-on I would like to show you how to

62
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:27,030
set up the sting for this purpose I will
go to the my colleagues machine I hope

63
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:37,450
you can see it here I have also cart I
already put it out into turning point as

64
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:49,240
you can see first of all to capture the
data we had some issues because she

65
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:56,860
would put doesn't support Jason YJ some
because elasticsearch speaks naturally

66
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:04,840
in JSON and also lockstitch knows about
Jason so we decided to modify the cult

67
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:11,679
of Aragon and ultimate oh that's called
on bridges is basically a copy of the

68
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,210
brides with slightly modifications so
this supports the

69
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:24,539
the JSON file format also what with the
change his number of props anybody know

70
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:31,520
what crops are OK for those that don't
know what crops are if you are for

71
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,189
example connected in your home network
and then come to the death camp

72
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,760
conference and put out your WiFi your
phone or device well as case my home

73
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,399
network around and this is actually a
broad and turns out I can catch those

74
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,600
crops and also done a lot of i-5 network
you have been connected to and I think

75
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:04,300
the number of us stand in the original
version of changes to 1,000 because we

76
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,380
found that one client has more than 100
Prague so he has been connected to one

77
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:17,750
hundred and four networks and you can
guess based on this data we can tell a

78
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,170
lot of about this client where he has
been moving my history he's been

79
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:33,740
connected and song I will show you this
later in practice but so let me go to

80
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,200
the to the Elks stack you see serious
elasticsearch running in the foreground

81
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,149
because of the bargain purposes like to
have a taste of what's going on and here

82
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:52,440
is lobsters running this is the typical
message he gets from Aaron dumping G and

83
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,790
you can see that he's doing some Rebecca
Jean Jason so in this kind of a he's

84
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:09,149
damn sending the data to elasticsearch
instance and here's combine irani let me

85
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:15,140
show you the conflict file of this is
the conflict file of luck session is

86
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,230
spruce a forward and easy we are are
reading the data from a file that is

87
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,790
located here

88
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:33,870
we are just seeking for Jason and after
that we are playing of filtering and

89
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:41,350
Talon locke says that it's actually JSON
and doing some modification at the and

90
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,330
the outcome is output to elasticsearch
and that basically it so let's try to

91
00:10:48,330 --> 00:11:01,410
round ever dumped in G I'm the comment
here it is nothing special about it I

92
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,819
just tell her that the cult format is
Jason I would like to have the

93
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,490
manufacturer of the client so based on
the mechanism declined I can get older

94
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,710
manufacturer and I would like to listen
on channel one let's run this and you

95
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:27,350
can see the pretty much output of let's
move here and to look stylish and you

96
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:34,170
can see the data is running our is
parsing

97
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:45,500
to the final act this is kianna anybody
who's given a great you can see here

98
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:53,780
data and if I'm refreshed stuff you can
see the counter has increased but

99
00:11:53,780 --> 00:12:01,220
nothing much here I can do for example a
full text search and grab some data out

100
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:08,350
of it but the real power behind combine
our visualization for example like this

101
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:15,050
and if you put all the visualization
together you come to the dashboard this

102
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,410
is an example of their sport it's from
today and

103
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:29,629
and it should be changed because because
data is running live from this regard to

104
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:34,949
hear and you can see you have already
are pretty good image was going around

105
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:41,079
you so with this basic setup you get
very quickly an idea what's going around

106
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,310
for example and culture at today

107
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:55,069
710 sixth clients that have been around
walking and we saw 12 wireless networks

108
00:12:55,069 --> 00:13:02,930
around and also 76 physical access
points to be a success I D is the

109
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:10,758
abbreviation of the MAC address of the
access point but let me do some

110
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:21,120
filtering for example I was also
monitoring yesterday I know I was evil

111
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,029
but let's elect yesterday see you can
see the data has been changed

112
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:36,980
dynamically just by specifying other
filter so let's like for example dave

113
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:53,529
Camp free network so actually not the
right one sorry this was a pro

114
00:13:53,529 --> 00:14:04,230
I need to add the visualization because
I forgot about it I think you know if

115
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,480
you do live demonstration there is
always something not working or karma is

116
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:32,209
a bitch and 43 right network and you can
see the graphs have been changed

117
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:38,839
dynamically you know the decryption is
open you can see that

118
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:45,759
121 station have been connected there
are 31 access points physically

119
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:52,740
yesterday but sometimes not accurate
because I was moving through the

120
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,250
conference and I sure didn't capture all
the clients that have been moving around

121
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:07,129
let me explain this simple graph here
from the inside to the outside you can

122
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:14,319
see it's about the death camp three
network and sheer outside you can see

123
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:21,550
all the access points listed and this
slices are actually clients that are

124
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:28,949
connected to those excess funds and
those clients have this one so it means

125
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:36,420
I can just a simple this graph I can get
a lot of information was going around so

126
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:45,920
from the network to the client to his
manufacturer and based on this data I

127
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:54,319
can tell you for example people to death
camp like Apple more than they like

128
00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:00,589
something I can all study that hero
hackers around because they used the

129
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:02,490
laptop still not just with

130
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:13,290
Samsung devices also Apple devices I can
tell you that the Afghan Kush relying on

131
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:21,670
Cisco is the main manufacturer and also
hero can see the activity of the

132
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:28,779
client's home any plans have been
connected at which time you remember I

133
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:33,700
said that this date is not accurate
because I moved if I did the monitoring

134
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:42,640
stationary Israel would be more accurate
but not the funny part or let's say the

135
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:56,050
evil part about props for example I can
see the Bronx of this guy and what I can

136
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:05,859
tell about the ropes actually a lot if
you if you recognize yourself just raise

137
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:19,099
your hand if you still then probably a
student or a professor the fee of the

138
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:25,869
Pony Express I guess this is the form of
Jason's read because he works on Express

139
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:40,330
Company so let's see on sheer here but
you gotta point before there was a

140
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:48,600
presentation about about how they choose
the EPA to pass works and is based on

141
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:57,120
their assessment if I'm correct correct
so they came up with an idea that they

142
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,909
named by fire access point

143
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:09,150
uniquely this is actually ok it doesn't
tell you much about a person but the bad

144
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,750
thing is if someone has been monitoring
cue

145
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:20,320
and you have a unique access point and
he is doing like for example using

146
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:31,060
mister minit this kind of thing this is
a tool to locate the location of

147
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:38,270
wireless network it uses of legal
services do based on the SSI idea which

148
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:44,180
is the wireless network name together
location and for example this name maps

149
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:50,550
to Romania and so basically based on
your bro hope I could wear your home

150
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:59,379
it's not that funny anymore because this
stuff can be used for stalking and I

151
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,620
also do a lot of let's say penetration
testing can social engineering and you

152
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,399
know in the face of information
gathering you go to Facebook you go to

153
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,990
LinkedIn and based on this Probst I can
also tell you a lot about you if you

154
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:20,410
like danny's if you like to go to the
restaurant which kind of rest around

155
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:28,200
where is it located where you have been
there and song so basically scary but

156
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:36,040
funny things can be see here and this is
an example of big data

157
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:43,090
you know let's see gang for health
here's something interesting let's do

158
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:48,209
you remove this

159
00:19:48,210 --> 00:20:00,430
and search for iPhone so I'm interested
in the products and let's see example

160
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:19,240
can afford to work on this desk I hope
this is not his name or first name what

161
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,880
I mean by that iPhone 4 usually
configured at least at the beginning

162
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:34,410
that they sent out props about the owner
of the iPhone it's time for me and so I

163
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:41,340
know he has iPhone he has worked awfully
sweet maybe an office that he is working

164
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:56,139
in let's try to let's try to find out if
this is actually a place in Romania yeah

165
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:03,100
it actually is so maybe an office he's
working and song so you got an India

166
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,469
based on the Bronx I can tell much about
a person I can classify it and i cant

167
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:20,500
find patterns in the internet so I would
like to show you something else because

168
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:27,790
we still have a lot of time how do you
know I expect is running basically

169
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:36,190
simply just let me find the comment you
can do our current search like this not

170
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:42,630
Alex X-ers elasticsearch instances this
turning on localhost and is listed on

171
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:49,040
this 4200 assists him and

172
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,610
once this wrenching cobalt elastic
searches that it doesn't have any

173
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,330
security access control into it

174
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:03,330
of course you can pay for additional
component like a shield for example and

175
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:09,840
then you have access control but the
only security feature in terms of access

176
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,110
is that it's running on localhost so you
cannot connect to my plastic surgeons

177
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:25,080
for example but as it turns out people
always find ways to do it the wrong

178
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:36,720
thing for example if you use children do
you know about children ok you search

179
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:45,810
it's in Romania and I just surged
elasticsearch drink and you can see the

180
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:51,929
turkey in some sense of elastic surgery
wide open what that means I can be

181
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:57,400
queried those that the basis I came
basically the lead the indexes were the

182
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:05,640
data and you got the picture I would
like to show you something out of the

183
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:13,640
topic maybe I searched for MongoDB this
is even nicer you can see the showdown

184
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:23,400
shows you how big is the database so
even a nice interface for example what I

185
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,140
mean by this

186
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,040
if the vendor doesn't do it right there
will always be people that also do do it

187
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:49,799
right so ok

188
00:23:49,799 --> 00:24:00,869
and maybe not so many so if you're bored
story on thirty minutes left

189
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:15,350
ok elasticsearch I told you that is
based on Jason its document oriented and

190
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:24,918
its scale of its kind of distributed
data base and plastic surgeons also in

191
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:31,289
his all in his basic terms of hacker
because every every technology was

192
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:36,889
around and they just connected to dot
distributed databases of us around

193
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:42,289
full-text Search Search was around and
what they did find everything together

194
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,779
and make it easier

195
00:24:44,779 --> 00:25:02,409
efficient to use and this wireless
experience also hecker

196
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:21,960
you know this is a beautiful you can
discover patterns patterns into the

197
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:29,039
visualization and so on so what actually
does all the heavy carrying here but

198
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:36,759
just a few clicks and Gabbana census
data LASIK surgeon then it comes out is

199
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:37,499
beautiful

200
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:44,749
reservation which looks kind of blurry
in mind

201
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:46,000
ok

202
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,410
look stylish I don't know if you see it

203
00:25:49,410 --> 00:26:00,470
anything I told you already about this
this is the scary part and you can see

204
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:06,470
the week Mr probz location is actually
where he did two years ago

205
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:14,010
all the presentations now let's try to
construct a graph undertake its heart

206
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,720
any ideas

207
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:36,940
nobody ok let's put a new visualization
and select pie charts you search and

208
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:47,740
here I was slack for example and let's
say is I did wrong

209
00:26:47,740 --> 00:27:00,870
ok ok again I was like the terms and
I've slacked instances I do wrong this

210
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:07,350
means actually I'm splitting and seeing
what wireless networks around limited

211
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:16,929
this kind of visualization to do for
example and I had I can see already

212
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:24,860
what's going around you know it's at
another sub orkut and let's do another

213
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:34,129
aggregation and let's say BSSID wrong
the MAC addresses of physical access

214
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:45,700
points and you can see here cleary how
many access points does not forecast and

215
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,480
if I'm adding another bucket

216
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,639
this

217
00:27:53,639 --> 00:28:08,978
and selecting stations Mac I can see
already which clients are connected to

218
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:13,889
reach access points in which Texas
Florence are parts of one at work so

219
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:19,570
basically just by doing few clicks I get
a lot of information if you put this

220
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:27,918
information into a dashboard you can
have real power what I forgot to set you

221
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:38,079
is that we actually did apply to get up
on patch of Aragon and G it's available

222
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:45,908
for free you can purchase a crack in
science source called and you have Jason

223
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:55,399
support some basic information is
available here but it's not so hard to

224
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:10,059
do this stuff so many minutes still ok
if you know about us section just not

225
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:18,109
going to happen now I'm just kidding I
like to share ideas because this is all

226
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:24,609
about the conference's to shower and get
knowledge if you know what I mean where

227
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:31,408
this setup can be used for example of
course in penetration testing social

228
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:36,429
engineering and security targets this is
the first kind of thing you'd think

229
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:46,909
about it also we can use it as a fire
for example both to CNN's you may be no

230
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:54,070
for example if I have a small advisers
capturing putting dating back and I

231
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:59,639
locket for example 25 MAC addresses that
are connected to my network

232
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,470
and suddenly 10 MAC addresses are
connected you know dan something

233
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,660
terrible has been happening so this kind
of stuff you can do with it

234
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:18,760
of course even even intelligence
gathering this kind of example I showed

235
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,810
you based on the Bronx and you know if
you have a lot a lot of data if you

236
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:31,700
monitoring everybody around you you can
see patterns into the data match people

237
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:37,550
do something out of it and song or
something for example if you this kind

238
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:45,350
of person I'm not and I also read about
an article

239
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:54,709
policemen had a great idea about
tracking stolen phones because but the

240
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,500
only condition you need to know them a
colossal to form so if you need the MAC

241
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,520
address and you do the monitoring stuff
you know that somewhere around his story

242
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,540
but if you do

243
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:12,379
angulation for example you can pretty
much show the person who has gone from

244
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:18,300
not hearing this crowd but maybe on the
street so this is another idea where you

245
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:25,909
can set up or use the setup I talked
about it and also if I'm heading to

246
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:32,100
Africa wreck yourself open networks you
know open networks like that game 3 I'm

247
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:38,240
not encrypted so this means I can sniff
the network and I can capture of maybe

248
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:45,640
some you're browsing data and if I'm
adding to all these data that I have

249
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:55,100
also where you have been browsing and
when that it becomes scary so but you

250
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,360
know with great power comes great
responsibility and you should use it as

251
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,090
you wish

252
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:09,570
I'm just going for my back can you can
you give me my back there I forgot to

253
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,260
bring it here

254
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:23,670
thank you like to show you one more
thing and then I'm done here

255
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:34,110
yes this is settling reuter it's
actually small it consumes 3d many mom

256
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:41,290
likes a par and if I'm put it in the
battery I have my private monitoring I

257
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:50,970
just executed and put open wrt on it its
own always be device and also I did some

258
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:59,610
scripts so if I'm just getting the
better 28 aircraft automatically loads

259
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:07,110
and by now you should switch on your
wireless because I monitoring and after

260
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:12,780
I'm done and just putting out this who
has be and putting all the data that are

261
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:18,420
half into my axe attack and visualizing
searching parents and so on so it's

262
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:25,870
pretty easy to set up things like this
and with open wrt you can surely do it

263
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:32,270
so this is what I had in mind

264
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:40,370
are then questions

265
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:49,239
to finger you have already

266
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:56,790
scripts for looking for funds that were
connecting from particular location for

267
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:01,850
example can you find quickly my phone
that was connecting usually in poland

268
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:10,460
can you do this this scope because seat
interaction with their website

269
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:17,740
first of all if you have been connected
to a network and you didn't delete this

270
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:23,020
not for yes of course it is constantly
asking for it and you can search and

271
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,800
should have it already in your database
and the question he sees you can search

272
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,240
our country not actually purple country
because i dont have this data but maybe

273
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:46,279
if you tell me you can look for streams
with UPC of course the source about my

274
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,730
pocket

275
00:34:47,730 --> 00:35:01,390
UPC a UPC a UPC this is the beginning of
the springs the second

276
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:16,910
like this yes maybe

277
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,348
know the particle number

278
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:29,599
you know ok here here because this is
the string you don't have space this is

279
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,289
on the perfect for it

280
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:40,509
ok maybe I didn't catch you but as you
know elasticsearch supports text search

281
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:50,339
maybe like this do you have what phone
do you have

282
00:35:50,339 --> 00:36:04,170
which manufacturer Samsung of course I
didn't capture ok but I was talking when

283
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:10,859
you are sleeping with my followed with
maybe this you know there's some errands

284
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:21,299
you know ok but you can I don't i dont
can catch every phone but I just put

285
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:25,670
song of the day today regarding to the
database and then I go to do the

286
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:44,359
analysis there's fresh

287
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:51,058
I will try to answer when when you
thirteen key partner in unity with the

288
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:52,170
results

289
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:58,869
explored the result yeah the results are
in plastic surgery can I know they are

290
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:04,180
in like 30 Jun 14 simply want to filter
some kind of light drizzle have a look

291
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:09,440
at the heat or something I didn't do you
see how do you can export them as

292
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:20,089
possible and this is my my question is
why I think you can you can export it

293
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:28,710
here I think but I didn't go into it
because it isn't needed so basically I

294
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,829
think you can export into a
comma-separated very files and

295
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:43,519
everything I can from from API but both
but it's easier to do a search surgeon

296
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:57,299
exported data on this kind of way for me
any question they're going to act as you

297
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:02,859
know we have some kind of back doors

298
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:10,808
do you think that the engineering and
engineers who today more like the

299
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:17,299
factories that intentionally and the
thing that they take some kind of data

300
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:25,190
from dad and feel some kind of data
please do you mean regarding its

301
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:32,239
coordinated or is just like for telecom
purposes for updating a firmer but in

302
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,100
the process thing or something else

303
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,370
I mean thirty forty percent of the
Reuters that have backed boris that's

304
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:55,600
why I don't know maybe so maybe not I'm
not expert say state of affairs alright

305
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,400
so nice question do you think that
someone did until now like bigger David

306
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,900
B

307
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,960
database of these data gathering from
all around the world

308
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:21,410
I'll never heard of it I think they did
I think that thank you I'll question you

309
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:28,740
