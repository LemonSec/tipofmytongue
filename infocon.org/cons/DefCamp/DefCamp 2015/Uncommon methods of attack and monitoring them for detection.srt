1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:12,519
tried to speak in a low voice or will
not wake you up you had a marathon of of

2
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,529
presentations with a lot of information
I'll try to skip weather was already

3
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:29,198
presented in the previous talks what I
suggest to discuss them with you is the

4
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,110
defense part and the previous
presentation was quite good for

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:40,570
introducing into this subject and I will
ask you to do very simple gymnastics

6
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,329
just to raise your hand if you are
responsible for security in your company

7
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:52,230
directly or indirectly he said just few
hands that is because security

8
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,269
operations center is really like if if
35 fighter jet until you start playing

9
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:04,720
it you have to do quite a lot of
training where I just viewers about us

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,679
just to jump the subjects we are the
division and inside the company concert

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,710
sign we were just a private search for
instant response ecology research we do

12
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,869
this we did it from scratch from one
year ago many security services

13
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:34,360
basically from consulting to operational
security and the response which is quite

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:46,820
a challenging task to do my thing today
is about defense side and we worked in

15
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,970
the past

16
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,460
but seemed more on the defense on
analysis on the response on

17
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:07,559
forensics I will just skip decided not
break too much and just introduced let's

18
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:15,850
say the main topic and I could just stop
this slide then say that attack easy the

19
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,970
defense parties hard this is taking
conference everybody's quite excited

20
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:28,810
about the offensive part but what I
invite you to think about is that the

21
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,800
industry the companies that would hire
security professionals and security

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,019
experts are mostly looking for good
professionals that will understand also

23
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:47,010
the defense part because if you know our
system can be hacked that does not

24
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,790
necessarily means that you also know
very well how to defend it

25
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,890
how to implement proper defenses and
I'll start with just an overview of why

26
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,190
we are here on light this kind of
problem exists end up with the two

27
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,970
demonstration to practical demonstration
that if you're responsible security we

28
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,380
can implement them in your your company
so just a few words about the problem

29
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,400
because quite later and I will try not
to worry too much

30
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,200
the topmost international level the
cyber security is recognized as a

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,970
serious risk that is a systemic risk in
a study by World Economic Forum on that

32
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:37,150
note that all kind of all categories of
risks cybersecurity risks are considered

33
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,709
systemic risks what does it mean it
means that a small change in this risk

34
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,239
posture can have influences and
cascading to all kinds of other of all

35
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,799
the risks the higher likelihood and
impact is of course with cyber attacks

36
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,830
but there's also that after the theft
and

37
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,580
critical infrastructure and you've been
through presentations this day covering

38
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,670
this convo aspects

39
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:14,100
also United Nations the similar research
but not necessarily on risks all

40
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:21,029
categories of risk but specifically on
cyber risks and of course we saw

41
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:33,570
different kind of attacks the different
kind of factors that influence this

42
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:40,099
category of cyber risks and the largest
1344 private companies is consistently

43
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:46,110
compromised computers that is because
for instance for public companies and

44
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:52,720
this is usually highly publicized these
data theft for now the private companies

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:05,710
have the bridge is inside them as the
the main risk factor now this kind of

46
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,289
dynamics are thought and all the
policies from national level two

47
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,470
European level and soul I thought on the
longer terms and when you look at a

48
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,880
factor on the longer-term you look at
accelerators inhibitors what can

49
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,010
aggravate this kind of recent working
decrease it and one of the accelerator

50
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:33,240
is of course the ecosystem with
cybercrime ecosystem and the truth is I

51
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,010
really wish for you not to see or not to
to be intimated to have 22 intimate

52
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:45,409
knowledge of how much money can be made
on the dark side because it's like it's

53
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,400
like someone Milicic attraction that you
hardly carries many can realize that can

54
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,109
make from 10,000 to maybe one million a
month

55
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,470
doing illegal activities and the worst
part is that they could system is

56
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:08,530
booming is an underground economy this
is is booming and law enforcement is

57
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:14,299
striving to counteract that and I've
been in past years two different law

58
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,630
enforcement conferences and
unfortunately I left with all the time

59
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:25,490
with a bitter person is because the
technical knowledge and capabilities are

60
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,310
quite low

61
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:35,450
the collaborative international
collaboration is really not working

62
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:40,659
takes years to even closer I don't know
100 K

63
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:48,200
damage case so these are all
accelerators moreover a lot of people

64
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,110
working in this dark side let's say
probably at least half of them have

65
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,730
absolutely no technical knowledge this
is the worst part because there is room

66
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:05,840
for entrepreneurship it takes very
little money to start this business you

67
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,390
don't have to imagine just have to have
that kind of sense for making money

68
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:19,710
easier taking of course the the legal
risks and when we see prices for credit

69
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,859
cards were four aboard met renting going
down that means one thing and you don't

70
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,330
have to be a graduate of Economics
understand that when the market where

71
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:38,200
the prices go down it means world that
actually the supply goes up the supply

72
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,240
those are because there is a growing
market there is of course competition

73
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,060
and I recall years back when I used to
work at a special order we will present

74
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,990
increased in some cases where mother
infections first thing

75
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,340
they did all the soda machine was just
just to search for whatever other mother

76
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,880
was there

77
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,670
remove it just make sure that they don't
have competition on the machine so so

78
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:11,870
this is another accelerated local level
we're not shielded from this event

79
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,590
Romania when we see what kind of
security report is necessarily there we

80
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,460
don't hear about be cases of millions of
losses we are more like a transit

81
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,940
country because of infrastructure a lot
of hours service are used to attack the

82
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:36,000
other companies but there are quite a
lot of activity remain as well that

83
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,169
means they're out of infected computers
as well somebody's making money owed to

84
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,089
them and here is just a recent you
promote threat intelligence

85
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:51,980
feet from his notorious of active but
it's very recently died in Romania so

86
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,390
this is just another accelerated why is
that

87
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,610
or what would be the root causes for
that while on one hand it's the defense

88
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,450
gap what we call defense deficit and
this is in a rent to this to this

89
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:16,240
industry will this field and the same
here is that cyber favors offensive that

90
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,150
means that it far easier and the forces
are asymmetric between offense and

91
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:29,150
defense are easier to attack them to
defend was then that companies ideally

92
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:35,250
would pay zero money on a kind of
security right if you work for any kind

93
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,440
of company accepting security and you
ask your bosses are the executives about

94
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,850
security how much money with the they'd
be willing to invest truth is they would

95
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,930
want to 80 if possible $1 if possible
they don't invest in securities they

96
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,630
just don't want to risk they want to
invest in whatever they're doing milk

97
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,230
factory machinery agriculture whatever
this is why we also say that securities

98
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,780
paine driven it's exactly the mindset of

99
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,600
you have when you go to the doctor
ideally will not go to the doctor at all

100
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,160
and pay no money and no analysis but you
you have to do at some point because if

101
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,660
you think it's the same thing but it's
different scale and the detection

102
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:26,890
deficit stands from this a symmetry and
if we look at this is from the famous

103
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,250
study of the resonator bridge is the
report throughout the years they were

104
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,700
always a gap between the time of
compromising time of discovery of the

105
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:45,100
compromise regardless or not mister
McGoldrick all the advances in

106
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,450
technology detection technologies
architecture on tomorrow and so on there

107
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,590
was always this gap and one of the
causes is because defense is really hard

108
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:03,480
it's tackling complexity over large
scale and is one terrorist said in

109
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,500
eighty four we have to be lucky ones you
have to be lucky always this is actually

110
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,980
unfortunately the mice adorn the
defender you have to make sure that you

111
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:21,470
write all the times and this is actually
prompted a new way of thinking that you

112
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,730
may have heard recently just called
somehow morally offensive defense this

113
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,640
is just an expression of our frustration
with this complexity of the fence we get

114
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,610
attacked and compromise from all
directions only would definitely like to

115
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:47,560
solve attack somebody let's head back I
mean this is another factor that the

116
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:54,390
fact that the favors offense lack of
attribution and this is the holy grail

117
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:01,040
of the security industry and companies
like famously now bitterly ironic league

118
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:09,420
money and pointing to China or no growth
rate pointing to russia it's really hard

119
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,500
to do attribution is very hard to do
actual offensive because you don't know

120
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,389
exactly who to have cut back and even
when law enforcement tries to take down

121
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:22,940
both meds they they struggled through a
lot of legal mumbo-jumbo legal barriers

122
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,449
may be crossing them a little bit like
Dutch police that simply disaffected

123
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:37,389
barnett's computers that were outside
the lines that cross the legal

124
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:43,509
boundaries so this is another
accelerated the defense gap between

125
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:49,560
offense defense and other defense gap is
what really stands for security is not

126
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,920
about technologies it's about people
this is I believe this is why you are

127
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,829
here you want to learn more you want to
get better at your skills and abilities

128
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:06,469
and unfortunately a lot of companies
have difficulty understanding that for

129
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:12,100
food security for good inside security
have to have serious investment in

130
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,540
formation of their security people or
contracting the right security services

131
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:25,560
is another recent survey security
responsible persons were asked what

132
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,339
would be the main areas for them where
do they

133
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:35,610
lack most of the skills and who was
performing forensic analysis determine

134
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,500
the root cause using these tools and so
on so these are actually some basics

135
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:47,160
things as you saw in the previous
presentation which was quite good

136
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,469
we have the knowledge how to organize
this kind of security centers with all

137
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,680
the procedures with all the formalities
and so there was a good question here in

138
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,609
the first row that person asked ok so
how to make sure that all those

139
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:10,610
procedures to happen in the real life
day by day I felt that the presented in

140
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,670
this case the question this is actually
an issue and it happens everywhere you

141
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,050
right procedures even for development
for whatever else is anybody any

142
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:27,380
programming in the room where do you
follow the product requirement

143
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:36,680
description definition yea or you could
just go through some use cases do some

144
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,780
requirements and then forget about them
go back to coding foot and this happens

145
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,390
in the operations as well there are some
procedure that the written somewhere and

146
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:51,750
then you go just pick us wouldn't go go
find them but this is a real hip and

147
00:14:51,750 --> 00:15:00,470
companies have an issue with with
abilities as well from the basic things

148
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,730
of Heaven to implement against him I
would not dare to ask how many of you

149
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:12,170
know that the company has a sim or what
is awesome because unfortunately the two

150
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,760
companies that simply do not implement
this very basic technology of monitoring

151
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:24,220
correlation alerting another defense get
unfortunately this time is on our side

152
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:32,800
to two people is the mindset is the
message yet and it it may be because of

153
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,089
the complexity we post poll implementing
purchase and updating the systems

154
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,880
because of fear of losing the

155
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,939
whole weekend or next two weeks fixing
stuff that simply broke but unfortunate

156
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:52,290
looking at the trends a lot of CV's
throughout the time are still being

157
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:58,310
exploited by exploiting long periods of
time even high-profile attacks seen in

158
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:05,599
the world to use even one year to year
old exploits and this is because we

159
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,730
failed to patch we fail to keep the
security up-to-date so this is not

160
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:17,850
related to skills or security investment
it's simply a waltz 2d hygiene moreover

161
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:24,600
it's not only about and this is another
myself problem is the outside guys

162
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,560
especially russia and China attacking us
everybody inside is a good person if you

163
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,739
look at this study done by Forrester 34%
of the attacks were actually watching

164
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,110
from inside that may mean insiders or
they may mean employees clicking on

165
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:51,730
stupid videos or whatever with this is
not a problem and it's a massive problem

166
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,930
and it's also an architectural problem
and I'll address it before the rule

167
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:05,329
introduced maybe if you haven't heard of
trust model what it means to complicate

168
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:11,198
things of course as the technology
involves for security measures the

169
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,910
attacker the attackers adversaries
advance their skills as well and another

170
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:23,310
aggravated aggravating factors are this
concept that outside are the bad guys

171
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:30,320
but inside we are doing ok so this is
called out stronger healthier stuff

172
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,820
outside soft inside and unfortunately if
you look we should take at least 20

173
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,350
high-profile apt campaigns in the last
three years

174
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:49,620
look at the compromising the actors 99%
will be some sort of spear fishing right

175
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,199
this is how they actually began what are
holding is just an indirect form of pier

176
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:01,309
fishing but they just target directly
inside your Citadel you may have the

177
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:08,610
toughest UTM zone fire or whatever if
that employee clicks on the link they

178
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:16,059
already inside and moreover you may have
sent boxing and unboxing going on

179
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:24,230
tomorrow technologies but they already
kept pace and recently we saw a surging

180
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:30,290
in this kind of attacks at least the
serious model already uses under

181
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:37,280
debating the idea and even techniques so
it's no longer just firing up I just hit

182
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,490
a five per household this is this is the
IP everything is very clear five minutes

183
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:48,370
we're all just sending it to cook the
books and books and there it is all the

184
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:54,350
indicators of the eurozone the AP's and
we've done our job unfortunately got

185
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,659
complicated because this remember these
guys are making a lot of money by using

186
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,140
our infrastructure so they want to keep
growing their business

187
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:12,730
moreover unfortunately I antivirus
vendors and security vendors or oils

188
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,659
vendors do not

189
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:21,619
keep up the pace either we just made a
test recently cuz mean just showed in

190
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:28,199
one of our internal trainings a very
simple PDF mingling with Metasploit

191
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:37,080
payload bypassing half of the antivirus
his own virustotal and that was 2008

192
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:47,228
2009 2010 so if that is possible that
simple technique is possible just to to

193
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:53,299
trickle antivirus to nazi payload in PDF
imagine very determined attacker how

194
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:58,970
easy it would be to just buy by parties
and the same goes with the vendors and

195
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:06,649
if you're familiar with the haitian all
the related tax that are his likud

196
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:13,168
indicates that is actually a structure
architectural flaw in Microsoft bought

197
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:19,609
these services they are trying to
address it right now and I think this

198
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:24,210
summer it could ignite the release the
product called Microsoft 88 that is

199
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,200
specifically designed to catch this kind
of attacks against Active Directory but

200
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,109
it's still a problem I think 99 percent
of the company still do not have proper

201
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:39,439
countermeasures to this kind of attack
which is quite direct against the ADM

202
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,330
from there we have the keys to the
kingdom and this law unfortunately is

203
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:51,978
even more why again because they're
making money we see attacks using using

204
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:59,249
powershell DMI interfaces we see
different methods of extra tration

205
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:05,539
unusual protocols a beer and all they're
quite usual and if you if you talk to

206
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:11,639
security people they will just installed
some AV put some new team in front and

207
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:18,570
think they're doing quite ok what is
relevant and we saw even with so-called

208
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:25,210
senior CSO's they'd even did when you
realize that there is more going out

209
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,540
there that simply

210
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:33,430
explain straight over HTTPS Google Drive
how do you catch that you have to think

211
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:41,470
a little bit further complicating
matters even if you do some sort of

212
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,420
Asian BBS since traffic inspection there
is still there are still take next to

213
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:53,750
hide the bong connection through
different addresses if you if you use a

214
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,740
hidden door service and this is already
quite advanced attack or technique that

215
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:06,680
doesn't really have any solution so on
one hand we have let's say a structural

216
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,570
problem of Defense months ago

217
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:19,010
technology gap and abilities get in the
race that is only trying to catch up we

218
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:25,830
have defense deficit of catching the the
the attacks what does it mean if if we

219
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,290
are to look on the longer-term

220
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:33,780
it can only mean one thing that defenses
we will be held in a harder but on the

221
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:39,379
other hand hopefully the executive level
we realize that this will impact their

222
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:47,650
business reputation and financial losses
as well so let's have a look at some

223
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,280
very simple defense fundamentals until
we get more practical and these are just

224
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,080
some recommendations I'll try to skip
what was already presented in previous

225
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:04,490
presentation the starting point should
be ok not an exhaustive exhaustive list

226
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:10,020
of things that you need to fix there are
very good guides like science

227
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,730
to paint the security controls and they
are quite actionable if you look them up

228
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,880
the guiding force for implementing those
controls they're not that complicated

229
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,530
it's not a nice golf 200 pages that we
need to read that is very boring and no

230
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,300
come on line there it's quite actionable
and this is this can be a very good

231
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:38,480
starting point from segregating the the

232
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,320
the rules doing asset inventory and so
on so forth so this is a very simple

233
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,230
thing I call it step 12 know at least
what are the best practices new industry

234
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:57,760
if you are responsible security and best
practices involve both let's say policy

235
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,020
approach but also technical approach
from the technical approach if you're

236
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,590
not familiar voice you to to get
acquainted with what the intelligent

237
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,939
very intelligent driven defense means
what

238
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:15,080
0 trust model means if you have a
security operation center you're ready

239
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,299
problem very likely ten percent of the
company's another very good practice is

240
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:24,100
not to be too have only response team
but we have a hunting team that would

241
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,699
look for potential indicators over the
internet will consume so getting to know

242
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:37,570
the best practices first indictment and
better security a second step would be

243
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:43,600
what previous presidents present also
said to know what I said you have been

244
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,918
accompanied and know them

245
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,850
programatically that means you don't
have an idea or did or did meaning

246
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,909
actually an inventory once a year just
to see where are those laws most laptops

247
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,770
nobody can find

248
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,960
worries that server that has to be in
but nobody can find it something like

249
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,660
this it's having them integrated in
systems that are continuously

250
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:13,140
discovering and can point out exactly
what you having a company of course to

251
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,820
assess them to see how they how they'd
seen from the security point of view on

252
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,809
there are very good

253
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:29,070
software security software for that
would bring them up continuously manner

254
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,600
continues vulnerability management that
means to know exactly all the services

255
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,248
that are being exposed in South inside
and outside moreover once you do that

256
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:46,100
you know what what are you know what are
their current form btw you need to do at

257
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,100
least once a year next size of threat
modeling because not all the victors

258
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,129
irrelevant as you may have very well
know there are published vulnerabilities

259
00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:03,248
that doesn't do not get exploited or
writing abusive for that is quite

260
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:10,990
expensive in terms of collagen and in
time this is well ahead on the other

261
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,980
hand look at all the assets of the
company are most W hey you have to start

262
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,460
were hurt small most for for the company
and there are methodologies that are

263
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,320
quite simply follow like a deal

264
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,330
ATC from from Lockheed Martin at the
white house a common sense you just

265
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:39,220
split them in system look at victors and
then implement the proper measures

266
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:45,129
traffic controllers so lovely and this
is really difficult thing to do but he's

267
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:49,509
one of the best things you can do you
know company either with the simplest

268
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:54,509
see him again final the market or with
solutions like our site we will show a

269
00:26:54,509 --> 00:27:02,629
bit later on is to do proper security
monitoring doing implemented calcium in

270
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:07,360
a company simply give your dashboard so
you can know what happens there and this

271
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:14,309
process can take somewhere between why
because you have to do like what the

272
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:18,879
previous speaker said we have to define
what you want monitor what are the cases

273
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:20,959
what are the datasources

274
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,759
ingest them correctly correlating
quickly with after that you have a

275
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,210
dashboard you can simply fly with
because you have

276
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:37,890
real-time alerts and you can actually
react and closed at defense gap between

277
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:44,909
two hundred days the average time
between the region and detection and

278
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:51,669
probably several minutes or hours and of
course it's also again it's about people

279
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:57,140
and training because people informing
people for monitoring analysis and

280
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,309
triage is quite difficult and there
unfortunately no such disciplines and

281
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:06,809
then we'll look at the industry at the
university's reelection no serious

282
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:12,299
seriously thought track for education or
forming this this kind of of profiles of

283
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:21,510
security professionals what to say more
that monitoring without enrichment with

284
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,760
threat intelligence is halfway through
one thing is to see that I don't know

285
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,629
from that flows you see a considerable
traffic to some IP address that doesn't

286
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,169
tell you anything you just look it up
and who is some server somewhere maybe

287
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:39,779
on Amazon Cloud and totally different
thing is to have the information from a

288
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:46,419
threat intelligence it saying potential
C&C four known but not server that is an

289
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:51,240
immediate flag that we have an affection
your network and this happens by

290
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,919
integrating this kind of feeds and we
will show an example just a bit later on

291
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:03,679
and of course you have to not wait for
anything to happen there are stages for

292
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,630
preparing for that

293
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:12,990
moreover threat intelligence and fortune
right now is spread over several

294
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:21,220
standards but they they converge some
somehow of course the most used one is

295
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:29,740
when I was open I was I was four months
even simple text right now might be some

296
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,389
time before I but there was a consistent
effort by mister organization which is

297
00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:40,658
nonprofit American organization that
works with the ages Department of

298
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:45,059
Homeland Security to define this
standards although standards with dark

299
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:50,729
blue that helped capture this kind of
information capture information about

300
00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:56,979
the objects suburb survivals the actors
them the method and their troubles of

301
00:29:56,979 --> 00:30:00,759
manifestation of model and threat actors
inside the network to easily share

302
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,940
discovering information and sharing the
security community is very important

303
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,769
because it allows enables others to act
on this kind of information I am NOT

304
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:15,669
saying that you have to go through all
the standards but at least get

305
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:26,320
acquainted with sidewalks stakes and
taxi for instance and I would just skip

306
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,958
that as previous page already spoke
about organizing the song takes a team

307
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:39,309
it takes the skills and the full
organizational steps what happens more

308
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:45,820
so funnies as it happened with tcp/ip
there was a body of standardization

309
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:52,189
working out all the details and there
was the industry taking up the most

310
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,070
practical part which was the four-layer
tcp/ip the same happened with open

311
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,009
houses the persons responsible between
his response just pick up the indicators

312
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:07,099
and starting and develop their own way
of thinking and this is a very simple

313
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:14,539
methodology proposed by many and
actually the mostly formalized some will

314
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:20,579
put it in words is just finding a lead
during an incident response capturing

315
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,740
the one form or the other

316
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:29,000
actually indicators and working of
discovering others going to make

317
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,650
stations and bring up the the map of an
attack so that was just a brief overview

318
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:44,090
of defectors why the problem is so
serious what defense is hard what would

319
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,550
be the basic security funding
fundamentals for defense and we'll get

320
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:56,360
to the main theme of this presentation
which is to give you an idea of how you

321
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,169
can start buttering up your security
with very simple thing which is

322
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:10,030
monitoring your generous requests and I
do advise you to take a look at your

323
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:15,040
trust model it's quite simple to
understand it was formalized somehow by

324
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:22,250
senior analyst at Forrester that
basically says do not look your internal

325
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:27,360
at networkers feature segment it and
treat each segment as a totally

326
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,139
different network do not trust any
serious talk to any other server but

327
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,740
make sure that you are indicating side
as well

328
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:41,450
a corollary to that would be there if
this kind of internal network is to be

329
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:48,179
seen like any external network then we
should make sure that we monitor each

330
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:53,800
and every component inside and one very
simple very handy way of doing that is

331
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,970
by monitoring the DNS requests

332
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:03,830
why because any mother needs to connect
to some C&C for some intermediary step

333
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:10,030
right in their major server hard coding
Eyed Peas is not very efficient because

334
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,750
they are easily blocked orally Isla
blacklisted and shared with

335
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:18,520
security community so they will
definitely use some sort of trickery

336
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,970
there too

337
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,230
to connect to their to their server and
we will look at two cases dimension

338
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:32,770
retail grace with which is another way
of treating the exit exit guardians and

339
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:38,770
very simple thing as joking blacklisting
the threat intelligence feed moreover as

340
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:43,730
I said earlier generous can be exploited
for other things for instance for latex

341
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:50,930
filtration you can trust for quite a lot
of of data simply over the Ennis outside

342
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:57,560
from the company but we will not cover
that one in this presentation so let's

343
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:07,129
let's get pregnancy a first example of
using DNS for integrated with the with

344
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,889
the same Western actually for what I
heard this one is life so this is a very

345
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:18,350
simple view of how to think your
internal network in terms of what was

346
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:27,250
called me make microcode perimeters so
if you do this kind of segmentation and

347
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,050
treat each segment as being a separate
network you can implement controls at

348
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:38,120
each checkpoint inside the network so
each service has to authenticate any

349
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,409
other server internally as if it would
be any external client getting inside

350
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:48,889
and why is that important as I said
because way to look at the DNS because

351
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:54,139
in the DNA she can't fit anything if you
can you can transfer even if you think

352
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:59,450
ok dennis is just a few packets actually
you can fit inside the DNS even larger

353
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:10,210
animals but this is the mandatory can't
picture in the presentation so let's

354
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,720
have a force them

355
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,680
Michael due to work it through thank you
to the so what do they are prepared to

356
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,020
the most one of them for the first time
is integrating threat intelligence into

357
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:29,940
work site and I have a question for you
coming off you know what is great

358
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,460
intelligence and if you use it

359
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:41,599
ok one person if you ok we knew my team
using our site

360
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:50,290
collective intelligence free marco 430
intelligence collection of intelligence

361
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:55,320
remark is an open source tool and i
think is very very powerful because it

362
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,970
allows me to to collect information from
many sources aggregated you making the

363
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:08,200
duplications and after all of these
things I can generate some some threat

364
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:17,259
intelligence of streets in my view is
because they want to show you know in

365
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:24,550
the video although all the steps
actually you can you use the collective

366
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:35,839
intelligence framework any other sim
solution we are setting their services

367
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:51,869
based access solution so so first of all
I will show you the DNS close to the

368
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:59,950
website this is the first

369
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:14,819
for that I create an active general and
like you see all the clothes are in the

370
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,170
same to explain what this is about

371
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:24,170
so everybody understand what is our site
what is the same

372
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:30,130
its monitoring and correlation solution
where you get all the logs from

373
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:37,020
everything from Windows system event
from your firewall from Exchange server

374
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,620
hosting server whatever you don't get
absolutely everything you just get the

375
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,180
blogs you need it gets collected into a
series and the same does some

376
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,310
correlations looking at the event's
looking at what assets were those that

377
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,250
sending events and so on the basis of
this kind of correlation can resolutions

378
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:00,410
it can be a simple alert like you have a
connection to a C&C server but it can be

379
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:04,390
more investors like this kind of
external IP does a lot of IP

380
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,609
fragmentation and by the way they also
have a collection from your process of

381
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,030
the to some internal network

382
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:16,790
at the same time so it can correlate
several types of of categories of of

383
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:22,779
events and recent alert for you while we
will show is the simplest way you can do

384
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,850
this kind of security monitoring by
integrating threat intelligence which is

385
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:33,089
a feed in different formats most of the
time it's a comma-separated value but

386
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:39,650
you can find it as a similar or so that
contains IP's and domains known to be

387
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:45,460
bad there is open source framework old
collective intelligence framework you

388
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,370
can use it from tomorrow that has the
that collects this kind of information

389
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,910
and the point of the demos to show how
you can integrate this kind of threat

390
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:58,470
intelligence filled with the same in
this case the same as our table you can

391
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:05,049
use Splunk you can use even look stylish
by like six urge you can use to radar

392
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,820
Logan Logan written Sigalert and so
forth

393
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:20,580
ok one mention our site two main
concepts I think general actively in

394
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:26,370
order to to make some correlation all
the event must be collected in

395
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:39,660
general or in active list so like I said
earlier I sent the dogs to the park site

396
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:47,420
through an active general and now have
all the all the losses

397
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:57,309
seemed OK after that we must create an
actively supported intelligence all the

398
00:39:57,309 --> 00:40:05,390
information that we collect it we
collect intelligence framework to this

399
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:16,390
list she steps first of all we must
define active least you want certain

400
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:29,200
name customize all the details the
retention period the capacity for those

401
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:37,149
of you which are not familiar with our
state i think is going but I think it's

402
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:47,640
really okay after that will keep the
field because the data collected from

403
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,390
you

404
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:54,589
has some freezing outside

405
00:40:54,589 --> 00:41:09,739
don't know all of the books how to
interpret that data or one of the key is

406
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:17,299
mandatory on all of them must be strings
the confidence is very important

407
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:26,640
basically the value determined by by an
ongoing implemented in collective

408
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,700
intelligence from or based on the values
the confidence release from the sources

409
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:42,598
from which the data what you can do is
get Alexa top one million domains and

410
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:49,009
import them in safe and say this is
confidence this is risk level 1 the

411
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:53,119
higher the risk the more probable dates
its mother to me so you can actually

412
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,529
white least known good domains and
blacklist hearing outside what we'll see

413
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:03,920
is that we will treat the domain as
Muller if it's about 85 I'm not sure

414
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,789
consider this is the point here of
defining actively in his will reloaded

415
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:20,779
several times this is why it's ok after
that we must create a rule to populate

416
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:31,849
this active least you will be a standard
standard actually this rule takes all

417
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:40,900
the information coming from the from the
city and the little bit order will see

418
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,260
that we make we develop

419
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:56,960
python script which helped us to follow
the steps ok we create a new condition

420
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:16,180
because we must you know the device name
which will be actions very important is

421
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:23,940
to activate it on first event trigger
because situations like this

422
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,630
the correlation rules will

423
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:33,740
going to intrude into the circle we
don't have any results so how are seeing

424
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,750
workers that is shown as a rule that is
the final in the system matches that is

425
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,900
called the correlation it's only then
what we want is that as soon as the

426
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,529
domain matched and that these turns into
a correlation not too much once again

427
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:54,519
once again this is the idea of turning
off specifying this kind of sitting so

428
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:59,368
what we are considering here is where to
get the domain this from this is that

429
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:06,480
and what are the rules that apply when
checking any kind of incoming event and

430
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,430
where do we need to have events from the
Guinness server right so the DNS server

431
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:17,750
has to send us some events that will
contain a domain and women event comes

432
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:23,250
to the same events come over syslog I
the system for much of Sirte format

433
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,730
which is very similar so we have the
same there are a lot of events coming

434
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:31,109
from different devices one of them are
related

435
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:36,640
some of them are related to DNS ok it's
a DNS isn't it contains a domain name it

436
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,319
into my active list of bed remains this
is what we're continuing if it matches

437
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:45,500
then we raised we have a correlation and
it will see further one what we do with

438
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,569
it actually is therefore population have
another reform

439
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:59,599
completion for the configuration of the
rule that we must move to the real-time

440
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:21,329
rules category we just created the route
now will take intelligence feet

441
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:31,459
doesn't have anything because it's very
snowy white on the weekends maybe skip

442
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:36,149
there by Jesse just a few hours so this
is simply exporting with a comma linked

443
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:42,059
to from 626 to assess be exactly and
then we'll just send the series v with

444
00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:47,819
the python script to the seemed like any
other logging system that was singing

445
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:56,829
something to the same ok after that
because we want to send to the email for

446
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:07,549
example we create a destination
correlation rules for Evans matching

447
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:20,288
domains so the previous rule we must
define the even the categories and after

448
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:28,269
death actions actions will be different
because we must do to compare the

449
00:46:28,269 --> 00:46:34,319
results from those two active least
productive least from the DNS part and

450
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:39,519
for the intelligence

451
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:55,348
ok we'll skip this part because the to
be complicated now destined to send the

452
00:46:55,349 --> 00:47:08,089
message we configure some local
variables because the same doesn't know

453
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:21,058
how to to parse although the information
in the US to every every line from from

454
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:25,910
the active list and for that is actually

455
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:50,879
programming this is the final step
malicious domain and we'll see how fast

456
00:47:50,880 --> 00:48:05,329
the same will trigger

457
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:07,880
no

458
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:21,710
it is OK directing the dashboard so the
first line you you see the the the

459
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:29,109
trigger alert as soon as the log from
the DNS server he reached the same it it

460
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:36,190
triggered the alert regarding the IP
address and the extra information that

461
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:46,630
is malicious what is the feed the social
through the information what is the

462
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:56,200
source and after that we'll see you will
receive an e-mail alert in all the

463
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:03,009
details regarding this this year and
what is known is that you can actually

464
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:10,400
trigger different kind of actions for
instance you may trigger to cut from the

465
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,740
fire although redeem any kind of traffic
that is already going to that IP address

466
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:21,609
so if this is simply sending another to
an email but what we can do is that as

467
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:25,690
soon as you see that there are some
computers in your network asking about

468
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:29,940
the certain to me just make sure nobody
else who already connected to the domain

469
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:36,990
so you you can configure any kind of
other actions that is a first for them

470
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:45,240
with very small letter is on the display
just to show that actually implementing

471
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:51,029
threat intelligence within to assume is
probably 15 minutes fifty minutes where

472
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:55,740
you define acting least defined mapping
rules defined the

473
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:05,979
trigger conditions and the the actions
and this is going to be to be proactive

474
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:10,980
in the network security monitoring
actually i think is my opinion that

475
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:16,580
intelligence with be in the know for the
next two years the future in

476
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:23,000
cybersecurity shootout that intelligence
we can catch marlin the detectors and

477
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:32,880
will be will only find a good compromise
systems but we can look it will go

478
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,440
further to the second termmore it's also
about data security monitoring and I

479
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,580
will show you how to catch a known
moderate in your nipples withdrawing as

480
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,640
I used

481
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:52,770
distributions accused union and
customized some days boards from one of

482
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:55,880
our investigation we have some

483
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:12,900
simple cooking

484
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:32,780
21 you are my colleagues if not you
should have a look at it

485
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:44,369
ok first of all like I said I customized
dashboard version which loan me too

486
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:56,720
activity in my network use drawing this
them abroad and ideas

487
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:05,980
intrusion detection system like snorkel
sorry cutter and I have big simple from

488
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:12,710
investigation from our red which used to
mention racial will do you know what is

489
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:21,339
it imagination going ok this is a big
demonstration visit accused by the money

490
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:23,869
developers to bypass

491
00:52:23,869 --> 00:52:41,720
insistence that Molly this moral purpose
also by CNN's because we'll see some

492
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:52,519
request to server nodes that
infrastructure looking

493
00:52:52,519 --> 00:53:02,390
generates a lot of requests to the
server to the DNS and when he touched

494
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:09,040
the CNC domain will exceed will have the
call back to the

495
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,580
to the server in after that

496
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,970
will compromise the system we see here

497
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:30,439
infrastructure have questioned regularly
which are familiar with security

498
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,170
monitoring will see very fast

499
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:40,180
these things and this is a trigger for
you to to to make an investigation in

500
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:52,490
your infrastructure we see some was not
related with

501
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,569
tomorrow that are using this

502
00:53:54,570 --> 00:54:06,540
the more tragic samples to show you that
not all the time

503
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:16,500
ideas assistance to help you to identify
very fast and you must make some

504
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:31,470
investigations and we must have the
correct mindset there are few talents

505
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:40,970
and also in the graphic we see a lot of
DNS traffic so we have a problem with

506
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:49,919
the DNS infrastructure must go further
to see what happened in the first of all

507
00:54:49,920 --> 00:55:00,330
we want to to see the top domains

508
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:08,690
for what would the request was made in
here you'll see something something

509
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:24,610
strange Dec so we have all the drama
generated by the mall not all of them

510
00:55:24,610 --> 00:56:07,140
are rife

511
00:56:07,140 --> 00:57:33,990
I think you have a bigger

512
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:48,299
the rules actually the Marlins make some
request over TCP protocol 11553 report

513
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:55,620
and this is not normal behavior is
normal and and this also is used by the

514
00:57:55,620 --> 00:58:01,150
a developer to bypass the monitoring
solutions like pasadena's because we

515
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:06,880
possibly in israel moisture only the DNS
requests made over

516
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:18,029
UDP protocol over in the 30534 if you
are interested

517
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:22,730
security monitoring will continue the
discussion

518
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:29,580
in the break in the next room because my
travel to the point was to detect that

519
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,790
there was a huge traffic of DNS requests
identify the domains and then take take

520
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:38,980
measures that was basically a showing
that you can do that with security and

521
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:44,210
another free solution that you can use
from from tomorrow so just 22 somehow

522
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:49,680
wrap-up will know the saying of trust
but verify

523
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,960
actually if you verify this same of
trust and verify you realize it was said

524
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,210
by president reagan it was just a
Russian proverb that was talked to him

525
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:06,130
so do not trust anything the old mantra
should actually turn into never trust

526
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:10,680
and always very fight especially your
traffic will be on think you
