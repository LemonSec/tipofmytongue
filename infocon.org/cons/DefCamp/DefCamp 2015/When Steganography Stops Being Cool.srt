1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,040
so I'm going to talk about the very
strange topic right at least it has a

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,730
strange word called steganography I know
how how much you guys are acquainted to

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,670
the word does anybody know what
steganography means Johanns some not all

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,530
so when I was putting together this
presentation I was thinking maybe I'll

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:27,010
talk about the history of what's that is
so I'm going to talk about the Romans in

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,780
Julius Caesar you know that started
super boring now nobody's going to want

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,640
to talk about that or listen to do that
kind of stuff so instead of that I i

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,900
look for different examples of
steganography more and more on a little

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,040
bit more current and more fun so I don't
know if you know this story is about

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:53,900
arnold schwarzenegger the governor to
her and a few years ago he showed up

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,940
being named some Democratic Party
announced that the very well so they

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,570
heckle him they told him

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:10,580
lots and lots of stuff they insulted him
now what did the guy that the next door

14
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,470
actually the next law that they were
trying to pass he vetoed it not only did

15
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:23,590
he veto the law he also sent this text
as the official reason I read it to you

16
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,490
cuz I realize it's very small steps to
the members of the California State

17
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,929
Assembly and returning Assembly Bill
1176 without my signature or something

18
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,130
now have lamented the fact that major
reasons issues overlooked while many

19
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,009
unnecessary bills come to me for
consideration for everything is

20
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,860
major Asian measure brought to the table
but the legislature just kick the can

21
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:54,500
down the alley it looks like I'm
projecting it now everybody was very

22
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,490
outraged because there's a hidden
message and I know you guys see the

23
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,830
hidden message there if you see the
first letter of every line can you see

24
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:11,460
what it makes out with you see you CK
why oh you how was the guy who actually

25
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,400
heckle him back there in the

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,560
and in the in the democrat

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,819
dinner so this is a hidden message or an
example of a hidden message nowadays

28
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:32,049
have been relatively few years ago so
not that many not too long ago so this

29
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,870
is a moral example of steganography is
trying to hide data within data to try

30
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,709
and do good

31
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:46,459
a kind of data that is unexpected in
this context into another data you know

32
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:53,180
that you would expect all this letter
actually a secret message and are going

33
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,690
to put this into the virtual world right
into the computer world and this is what

34
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:08,769
are no worse actually telling Tom
Ammiano which was so in the virtual

35
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:16,310
world with this translates to is
normally putting hidden Mestas into

36
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,769
pictures for instance right so in a
picture if you notice the left hand side

37
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:28,920
there's the complete white complete
widest and 255 complete white saturation

38
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:39,560
no you that bit a little bit down to the
left so it's a 254 254 250 forces than

39
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,480
white humanized on Saturday so you can
use that difference in order for you to

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,858
encode a bit so instead of putting
complete white you put slightly great

41
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:57,030
and instead of 10 so you can encode one
bit of information if you go further

42
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,440
down and that's a 252 just for
comparison you cannot seem to the human

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,049
eye that's complete white that way you
can encode a lot of information this is

44
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:15,980
the picture it's a classic picture of a
model it's been hows 1970

45
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:25,090
too many to November 27 to play made not
been houseman playboy so this for some

46
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,570
reason I have no idea what the stable
steganography geeks have used this

47
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,540
picture always to show differences in
encoding data and pictures so when get

48
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,560
started to do that mean sorry they
designed this starting to do that this

49
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,290
the encoded information into this
particular image if you notice at the

50
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:52,199
left hand side is the real image from
the real jpg at the right hand side its

51
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,449
encoded information there is a hidden
message there it's completely impossible

52
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,380
the human eye to discern whether there's
encoded information and if you look at

53
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:09,139
the histogram the history tells you what
how many colors of its type right you

54
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,080
can see the color this division it's
spiky if you notice there's a little bit

55
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,750
more spikes which means that there's
extraneous information but you won't be

56
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,320
able to discern from the naked eye

57
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,830
there's nothing strange there so this is
the way to encode information this is

58
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:32,120
the way that stable weeks have been
doing it now at the end of the criminals

59
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,610
are going for the money so this is
really pretty this is very good you know

60
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:43,729
Jay bags das good but the guys just want
the money so I'm going to be telling you

61
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:51,620
by way of example how different malware
writers persons behind this model where

62
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,930
r encoding information I using
steganography in order to make money in

63
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,560
order to encode information to be to fly
under the radar so they're less likely

64
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,020
to be detected but they're not the only
ones right

65
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,950
criminals are are very common and very
frequent but they're not the only ones

66
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,289
who create model who else create small
were any idea

67
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:27,159
nobody these guys write those guys yeah
those guys and what do they want it or

68
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:33,710
no money is going to be for spying for
trying to get information from their

69
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,899
targets so these guys are going to find
steganography incredibly useful for the

70
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:38,849
purposes

71
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:44,878
there's been a few examples leader state
sponsored more were there is using

72
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,240
steganography nowadays who else is using
malware nowadays to attack these guys

73
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,649
actually know these guys were dunno
terrorist activists you name it right

74
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:03,229
guys who want to smear create smear
campaigns to to defame to destroy the

75
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:08,139
reputation of their targets so again
these guys also find it useful to create

76
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:14,879
my own to be more difficult to detect
now I'm going to go for the examples

77
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,209
remember that I'm going to be putting by
way of example showing steganography

78
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:24,639
assets been currently used in my way if
you were here in the previous session

79
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,849
for track it's one of the mothers that
uses that I did not go for some reason

80
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:38,279
sorry role and I told you that are not
going to help me are not going to help

81
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,219
me he's hiding something there so the
first one they have here it's looks

82
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:48,830
looks is a downloader in the same way as
well track it just download stuff now

83
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:55,659
what does it download actually it has
now gone its own icon and if you look at

84
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,680
it closely these are from two samples
you look at it closely at the picture at

85
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,180
the edge of the victor

86
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,409
you can see that there's like garbage go
try this is something some pixels there

87
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:11,459
don't belong on the right hand side
again same thing it's the side of the

88
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:16,430
picture frame there's some extraneous
information what is that it's actually

89
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,699
code treats that as code is not they
know it's real code is just ended there

90
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,620
any runs it and he continues his
routines does the first one being able

91
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,120
to

92
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,289
hide malicious code with another call
now you might think that's not super

93
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,718
useful in the same way that you can
encrypt in layers like road was telling

94
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,289
us you can also to split their what was
the difference between encrypted code

95
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,730
and this kind of God not much really

96
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,790
the broadly stable geeks that really
like to you still not a lot more than

97
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,020
that as by way of example

98
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:02,050
lurks also is very interested in that it
has this this can of peas he goes to the

99
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,810
CNC any downloads what the weather's
download download his picture that's a

100
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,540
very ugly picture right he looks like
quite yet but we know that why'd you can

101
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,050
encode starving wait because I doesn't
discern between very close

102
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,079
hues of Wight now if you look at this
picture that the upper part is the

103
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,370
header but the lower part it's the white
it's actually not why do you look at the

104
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,470
end and the FBS

105
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:45,800
255 255 situation but it's a 255 255 254
agree with the actually in cold here

106
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,150
it's a URL including the euro which is
the next step of downloads downloads

107
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:57,900
here and it continues the process do you
see how it works both codes code within

108
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:07,819
code and code sorry URL within a picture
so that's one example

109
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,750
well another one stakeholder much more
complex than this actually download the

110
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,020
picture and within the picture you can
find real bits and bytes often are

111
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,300
seeing coded piece of code so inside
there's another DLL which it puts into

112
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:30,260
memory unbranched this is this is the
stuff I really it when I was putting

113
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,790
together this presentation I thought
this it's really not worth showing lots

114
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:40,170
of bits and bytes so I'm just show you
the picture now the thing about this one

115
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,920
is that when you are as a virus analyst
when you're seeing all this exchange

116
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:52,290
without looking at the virus you only
see somebody trying to download this Jay

117
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,120
back from the internet and that's it
that's why you see so any device trying

118
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,460
to see the exchange of information will
only see a JPEG being downloaded we have

119
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,680
no idea what's inside

120
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,180
actually there's called and say there's
a DLL theses a DLL download inside

121
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:14,310
their image which is scary and itself
now the second part this was encoding

122
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:19,239
code are you getting gored also data
right configuration they don't normally

123
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:28,380
the next stage this is Arnold trying to
go to tell you is going to help me so

124
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:39,170
who's who's p.m. this is part of the
code and promises can promise that so

125
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:44,140
you have a download of a dbag and you
can see where you downloaded from so

126
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,880
it's just a JPEG download pure and
simple nothing else nothing fancy about

127
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:56,020
this message a big it down as a deep
which is this beautiful sunset again any

128
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,560
device in the way would only see the
JPEG download that's it so he will know

129
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,089
what it is it's actually the codes are
see encoded in the codes to something

130
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:11,700
that it's a paradox that delighted the
original images to view of image at the

131
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,190
right hand side is a modified image at
the very end it has stuff appended its

132
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:25,250
encoded with RCA for when you dial the
code with this is the contents in ASCII

133
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:31,960
know where you the code that its regular
sues configuration file so it has actual

134
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,790
configuration they die within the image
download an image it looks like an image

135
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,010
it is an image but appended to it
there's something in coded that is most

136
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,300
of its configuration they don't see this
is news

137
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,510
another example on this is in the mobile
domain that's very interesting because

138
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,980
this was a malware that got installed
promising that it was a poor and

139
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,720
application for Android now I know
you're interested in that but I wasn't

140
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,440
allowed to show you saw that was
pixelated but in the end the icon it's

141
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:13,020
it's a poor and I can write in the icon
inside there's hidden information so if

142
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:19,600
you look at the icon durst just pure B&B
they reduce pixels and there's a marker

143
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,280
called text software and some stuff that
looks like it might be pixels no it's

144
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,050
not it's not because if you look at the
code that's the beautiful thing of

145
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,359
underrated gives you the code right so
you look at the cold and you see what

146
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,190
he's doing is looking for a marker and
it's doing some stuff does anybody know

147
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:46,230
what this piece of code is doing to
recognize the XOR is exploring with with

148
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,320
a very ugly key get that key is just sex
or nothing nothing fancy just a very

149
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,380
long now view X or that piece of gold
within the icon is what you get this

150
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,260
configuration data it's it's SMS it was
texting SMS to Premium Members nothing

151
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:09,810
fancy about this one but it was encoding
within the same icon within the porn

152
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:15,609
icon other Android application he was
including all the configuration data so

153
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,270
if you look for it if you're trying to
look for the

154
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,380
configuration data from an analyst point
of view you won't see anything it's into

155
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:30,530
the into the icon which is interesting
and the third part now we know with a

156
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:36,140
high coat we know they hide data and
they also highlight CNC communication

157
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:44,460
and yeah you were waiting for it so I
know this time to stop communication

158
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:51,730
here so more very interesting you know
what this one does in order to see what

159
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:59,110
the CNC is instead of having it hard
coded it makes a DNS connection it asks

160
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:08,240
a certain server for a certain domain
and only text so if you make a request

161
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,760
it doesn't work so doesn't exist I don't
know what it is but if you look at if

162
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,200
you ask for a text so what to text
associated to this domain

163
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,220
this when you get there is change what
would you get that now the virus after

164
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,410
doing this DNS requests gets that they
don't because he devoted to this so then

165
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,420
the next stage is that one makes the
second now he got the C&C

166
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,099
text description from a domain and
remember that that domain does not

167
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,320
resolve normally within the eight just
is not resolved only with a text the

168
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,030
text has been doing is being used for
something so this is a way of

169
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:58,930
steganography right you would never
expect that in this channel to have this

170
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:04,339
kind of information if you're looking at
the fire's point of view looking at this

171
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,020
communication you have noise the other
data channel is being abused to encode

172
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,430
information that does not belong there
completely does not belong that tax

173
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,630
there is one way of getting information
within a C&C but there's more where

174
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,649
banker

175
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:26,360
how there's this one get what the next
stages where this season sees this is a

176
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:34,600
very creative one is relatively modern
March 2014 now it goes to Pinterest it

177
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:43,550
goes to Suffolk pins and if you look
down our lives down and looks who r for

178
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,508
that right we look for them and somebody
commented that that stuff comment is

179
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:52,829
that if you look there that's a very
strange comment it's four numbers

180
00:16:52,829 --> 00:17:00,118
provided by ABC indeed it is an IP
address it is actually the CNC it goes

181
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:05,760
to Pinterest it looks pretty specific
comments it known that it's an IP

182
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,209
address and he puts together the whole
URL for the next stage of the C&C so

183
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:19,010
he's using public public sources just
public URLs in order to look for the

184
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:25,309
next stage of the C&C download now in
the same vein bro similar to this is

185
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:26,069
Jenica

186
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:32,210
January 2015 very similar to this but it
does it doesn't with your YouTube it

187
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:38,740
goes to YouTube specific YouTube videos
and you see down there there's a very

188
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:45,350
strange comment right are our
anniversary with a number it looks looks

189
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,250
like what is this

190
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:56,100
there's more examples here a little bit
bigger generally 2004 modern now this is

191
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,250
the piece of code if you look at the
piece of code that creates it divides by

192
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:10,179
31 33 37 elite which is cool and needs
some special algorithm it creates an IP

193
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,460
and just communicates with baby that's
it that's all it's actually the same way

194
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,830
that number it included an IP address
that is the next stage of downloads it

195
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,350
has a configuration they died inside

196
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:29,209
to continue the infection so just
including information in an unexpected

197
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,160
tunnel the scary thing is that if you
don't know that this is happening was

198
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,250
was you know to expect this then you can
contact you to you can take it down if

199
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,910
you have no idea what is that this is
happening you only see some computer

200
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:49,280
downloading a YouTube page that's all
you see that's it nothing else nothing

201
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,379
suspicious

202
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:57,010
it's actually asking for configuration
examples this one is hammered as it's

203
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,150
the one that its state sponsored using
steganography also in this vein July

204
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:09,200
2015 so this is very very recent so what
this one does it it goes to Twitter and

205
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,780
on Twitter it looks for the latest tweet
of a specific user another user doesn't

206
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,480
exist

207
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,409
usually it doesn't exist now the day
that the bad guy actually said that a

208
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:30,520
state sponsor eight so the country that
once to issue commands to this hammered

209
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:38,179
as it creates that username every day is
a different username so they want to

210
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:42,580
communicate with the user name and the
tweet they do things like that now it

211
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:49,350
looks like a new user just created today
is doing something that it's doesn't

212
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:56,918
make any sense now the malware knows
that that user today's user hosts a CNC

213
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:02,730
C&C server so that is the C&C server for
a two-day

214
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:08,630
for the for the next day but the
download of the inspection now if the

215
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:16,610
bad guy if if the particular country
affecting doesn't want to issue commands

216
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,629
the just don't create the user don't get
to these user the day they want to

217
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,669
create that they want to issue the
command is created using it as easy as

218
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:27,059
that

219
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:33,280
to it's one that's what is used for now
what what country is responsible for

220
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:46,100
homicides any idea did you guys us' snow
is not russia is Russia according to

221
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:55,490
some antivirus vendor which I won't name
and another use for steganography is to

222
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:02,799
highlight stolen now I've always been
thinking that it is like trying to use

223
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:09,150
unexpected channels to put them inside
it's perfect for this and I haven't been

224
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,320
able to get to see a lot of this so I
forecast that in the future this is

225
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:22,119
going to be the most useful way to steal
information because if I see that

226
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:28,958
an infected computer it's sending away
credit card data can I know well that

227
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:33,989
that computers infected now that guy can
be sending 10,000 credit card numbers

228
00:21:33,989 --> 00:21:39,899
all of a sudden through HTTP that's very
obvious right now if they use some HTTP

229
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:46,468
sneaky like putting it into a 64 and
encoding it into an HTTP request now

230
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:49,819
that's different and I were talking
about how I had no idea what it is

231
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:55,529
anything that's happening any anybody
sitting between the infected PC and the

232
00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:04,989
server will be able to to see nothing
nothing of interest now that this is so

233
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:12,499
this is what happened with vivica
typically it's it's a little information

234
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:18,069
stealer from poland we know that it's
important because its target

235
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:26,109
specifically polish credit card bank
accounts which are made up by 20 digits

236
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:30,519
said 20 digits altogether that's what is
looking for its looking for the memory

237
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:37,329
and it picks it up so he knows this user
is providing some website the bank

238
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:44,009
account to pay and what did you do with
it it has no idea what to do with it

239
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:50,419
there's no configuration they did not
upload side there's nothing now what it

240
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:57,529
does it sends an HTTP request to a dummy
website since you see that they get

241
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:03,629
requests / some garbage it doesn't exist
it comes back with a moral core but it's

242
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:08,349
a fake corridor and you can deliver it
because it's not a 404 not found its own

243
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:13,770
site now installs solar creating a new
HTTP

244
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:20,629
we still deeply response here for four
side now installed and within a dream

245
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,130
that response there is something in
court it and that's something included

246
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:31,060
is a new Polish bank account so then the
mall were what it does its it replaces

247
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:37,240
all instances of the users by this one
so that they have to receive payments

248
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,370
instead of receiving payments to the
user's account he receives it to the bad

249
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,060
guys

250
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:49,679
account but it got it again it guided
through HTTP encode it so you would

251
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,030
expect to have a 404 response you
expected to have any real information

252
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:02,500
any configuration configuration the
power to do some stuff with right and

253
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:09,220
you would expect it to either on a tour
of the response from a website so so

254
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:15,600
that's another way I hope that in the
future this is going to be more

255
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,399
going to go more right because I could
for instance asked to take website

256
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,650
something and put something in the post
down completely nonsensical trying to

257
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,920
put information and nobody would be able
to really expect anything out of the

258
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,740
ordinary you can use any protocol not
only if there's a lot of echo here you

259
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,710
can use any product of their 2008
information is at the end of the days

260
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,570
it's putting unexpected

261
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,929
expected to handle so using a channel
that doesn't belong there to put

262
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:55,770
information that you would expect now
what's care about this that these

263
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,570
examples I'm telling you because i've
seen it right but I can't tell you

264
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,159
things that I haven't seen because by
definition these are using unexpected

265
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,320
channels I'm not able to ascertain
whether there's information being

266
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,070
exchanged or not and that's a scary
thing there must be lots of them using

267
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,080
all other channels that have not seen
because I have no idea what to look for

268
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:24,730
and that is happening that is happening
now the conclusion is this one at some

269
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,410
point he was really cool like something
that makes a

270
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:38,080
you can put secret messages in today you
can use any channel to encode

271
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,260
information and if you don't know that
is there anything you would look for it

272
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:47,820
because you don't know that is there now
the moment that bad guys start using

273
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:53,639
this to make money out of it or to
actual trade information or a truck

274
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,740
information or perhaps to do terrorist

275
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:04,750
behavior there then it stops being cool
because you cannot you cannot by

276
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:11,480
definition look look in a place that you
don't expect something that you don't

277
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,160
know it's there you just don't know
what's the what's the only thing you can

278
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:23,620
do start looking for unexpected things
like if you see that the NHS is supposed

279
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,030
to be a very short conversation and you
start seeing very huge chunks of the

280
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:33,840
exchange that strange but you don't
really know what's in there right so the

281
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:41,270
end of the day it is cool but it can be
evil right it can be bad it can be

282
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,580
misused and abused very easily and would
not be wise we have no idea that that's

283
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:56,129
happening

284
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:08,650
we have time for two questions please
use the easy ones yeah so everything was

285
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:22,110
clear I have seen in the question I'm
going to ask have you seen any still

286
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,939
gonna for every light on the color
channels of them out there that are

287
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:33,220
communicating to the client and server
so that's what I'm saying that correct

288
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,840
channels are by definition until I see
them when I see them then I know is

289
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,209
there then I can create a rule looking
through them but I expect that there's a

290
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,890
lot of them that I'm not seeing because
I'm not looking for them until the

291
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:56,730
moment when I see the mower then I open
it I see the Cold War I start reversing

292
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,520
the coat and then I see what's happening
all it actually works this way or so

293
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,510
then I know what to expect and the next
time I see a call to Pinterest looking

294
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:12,370
for this specific string they know that
they're looking for a serious interest

295
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:18,500
image absolutely there's there's a lot
of covert channels I I know that

296
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,820
I suspect that there there has to be but
I don't know what to look for

297
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:36,669
otherwise they will be covered does make
sense once you find an image ladies how

298
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:42,700
hard it is to trace back it because it's
posted by user created for from

299
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:51,800
something from some part of the world so
you want to trace it back to a user who

300
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:57,050
created the secret message it is very
difficult because it depends on what the

301
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,520
secret messages but normally it's either
going to be coat nation so the data is

302
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,030
not gonna give you anything that relates
to the user and if you look at where

303
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:13,320
it's hosted be hosted on github in my be
hosted on Pinterest and YouTube with

304
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:20,770
your YouTube I would but the police can
go to YouTube who uploaded this they

305
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,210
give you an IB that I've been may or may
not tell you anything more often than

306
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:33,050
not if the guys will not tell you
anything if the guys in the area but

307
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:41,770
normally bad guys a little more than
that you really about why are you

308
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:51,629
looking for any other questions thank
you so much for a presentation
