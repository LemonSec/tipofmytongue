1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
my name is an extended a hand there will
be a moderator for today the agenda has

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,519
plenty of interesting briefings and
without seeing more I want to introduce

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:16,980
you the first I think that you were all
waiting for Mohammad between pieces

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,289
senior security researcher and the
penetration they're still at the TAS

5
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:26,779
solution with more than 30 years of
technical experience he has been working

6
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:32,759
in different fields from government to
telecom providers you will have a

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,930
presentation about how to build a
weaponized honey but give him around

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:59,829
today we can speak about building a with
a nice honey pot

9
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,470
anything about this idea of building a
system which can defend itself it's it's

10
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:13,530
pretty much amazing you know and it's
it's very good to come up with such an

11
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,979
idea so let's start there was something
very simple so we will go through an

12
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,179
introduction of facts about animals so
many boats are adequately modeled system

13
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,579
so it's adequate system its main purpose
and idea is to receive users who are

14
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,479
interacting with it

15
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:37,610
to collect as much as information as
possible right and it's heavily

16
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:45,100
monitored also detecting honey put
things get a little bit tricky right but

17
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,979
once it happens it can be very dangerous
on your infrastructure because if it's

18
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,908
like a highly interactive and we'll get
through this later on it can be used as

19
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:02,020
a starting at that point to compromise
other connect assistance also honey pots

20
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,829
can decrease the gap between security
threats and security solutions everyone

21
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,350
has ideas ideas and minors

22
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,440
his environment right and honey pots is
pretty much effective in lowering down

23
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:23,600
false-positive rates and terms of how we
use systems threats are also honey pots

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,650
can function as stress reliever in case
of president attacks so ambitious users

25
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,080
are taking your environment and he's
trying very hard and you can distract

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,130
him for a while when you are maintaining
your infrastructure and see exactly

27
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,790
what's going on in your systems and try
to work on it and get on the flight so

28
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,489
publicly available honey what was by was
made by Fred call ends and was called

29
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:55,050
the deception in 1998 so many parts can
be caused by the way different things so

30
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:02,430
what others are saying this talk this
classification the design so we have no

31
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,980
interaction and high interaction
hundreds of course we can classify them

32
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,690
by usage for example so we have research
on words and we have production reports

33
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,450
we can there is there is a lot of
classification you can use but for this

34
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,790
presentation 246 presentation revenues
the design so the local interaction

35
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,959
iPods the emulators as they are not
fully supports so

36
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,280
community service and it has like some
limited comments so for example the most

37
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,180
famous ones so we have to be you can
list faience you can go through files

38
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,430
maybe you can put a file but you cannot
delete file for example so you don't

39
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,580
have the intervention to be the
intruders interactions are limited of

40
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,930
course the limit of the emulation
provided by the Hon'ble Sao Paulo

41
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,230
interaction hundreds are easily detected
saw your environment and you're using a

42
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,840
lot of the chances you are getting that
is very high and the good thing about

43
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,160
the loans are actually using a
relatively few hardware resources so to

44
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,400
implement and deploy a loan production
it will not take a lot of time but will

45
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,000
not take a lot of effort doesn't need
any technical expertise at all

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,019
and the same time I'm gonna save you the
resources but on the other hand are

47
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,370
gonna be bad in terms of detection on
the contrary the hundreds and hundreds

48
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,890
of different a little bit so they were
fully mainly because it was so you have

49
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:39,219
an entire solution interpreting system
on Interstate was services and that

50
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,400
occurred on the militia susan has the
full access full knowledge of

51
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,150
interacting with your system for
comments for FTB or whatever you're

52
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:54,190
trying to military so then the actual
the limited user attack Iran than $2 is

53
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,630
limited to his imagination so whatever
you want to do it again

54
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,030
totally the server he can whatever you
can do you want to but the problem with

55
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,820
these guys this kind of money was used a
lot of resources and it takes a lot of

56
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:18,610
technical expertise to maintain it and
to deployed so this is very important to

57
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,980
be we'll configure otherwise the combos
a serious security risk to the

58
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,610
environment so imagine that you are
using interactive honey put in your

59
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,070
introduction and emotions have been able
to pop it and the funny part is

60
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,500
connected to examine your DMZ and
connect with your webserver to mail

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,460
server because of course you have 20
traffic which is hitting you miserable

62
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,849
with server and from there he used it as
an attack point of attack Mr Wilson were

63
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,460
so again oppose a lot a lot of risk so
if you don't configure it quite good

64
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:54,250
you can't isolated from a logical and
physical perspectives this kind of going

65
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:01,910
to be like a very serious security risk
so long people are not using these days

66
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:09,430
most of them like take sides and you're
not using it but I find interesting

67
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,530
solution ry because they can frustrate
malicious user at the extent of saving

68
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:21,599
the network resources so he will get
frustrated he's affecting your systems

69
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,930
are thinking about your web server

70
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:31,270
getting underway will raise the cost of
a cyberattack so the course of cyber

71
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:38,380
attack it will get a little bit higher
also I don't wait until a compromise

72
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,759
host a malicious user so the problem is
that 45% of beaches wondered why they

73
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,820
are happening internally and it's an
internal internal compromise or

74
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,719
diminishes internal use of animals are
very effective on the King internal

75
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,099
threats and kind of conclusion that
happens Internal Revenue Service also

76
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:05,009
honey pots can integrate with the blue
security solutions so for example I'm

77
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:13,560
using iPS and I'm using a final and the
firewall got a slight which he directed

78
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,509
to the honey pot and honey pot gave
buttock rash challenge and from here is

79
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,050
now positive that this is a real attack
so a better beginnings of our 14 buckets

80
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,680
or die cast looks at all so they can
feed the diluted solution so a lot of

81
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,479
people these days are using some
solutions please raise your hands if

82
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:40,940
you're reading from tuition
reimbursement awesome 2012 so since we

83
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,300
are very effective for murdering your
systems your network and see exactly

84
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,860
what's going on in your systems and the
problem is

85
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:56,030
was the same solution that the the
problem wasn't that everyone needs a big

86
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:02,979
data packages briefcases and the best
way to get the best accurate pieces is

87
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:10,520
true why because I will feed you was an
accurate results and those results can

88
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,430
be automatically fit dual sim solution
and you build up a very good of her

89
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,949
cases or use cases which are customized
for the environment so you can see the

90
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,870
real risk for your business and your
network also honey pots can easily

91
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,990
detect included in clinical measures be
a lot so for me

92
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,350
excellent work

93
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,960
I would love to include my pillow or I
want to encrypt my build bridges this

94
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,520
nation and possessing for example and
ideas or a firewall but the good thing

95
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,280
about animals that they can easily
detect these girls it's a full

96
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,120
simulation hundreds around us everywhere
but we barely notice how many of you are

97
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,320
using virtualization event please yeah
that's what's so special editions are

98
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,270
very very very good use them if you're
looking for sharing resources

99
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,079
this is not a honey pot but if you are
looking at it from a sandbox perspective

100
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,340
and a threat to this is because you are
putting a slip inside your virtual

101
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,530
machine and you're trying to analyze its
behavior so you are deceiving the people

102
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:23,300
that are trying to reverse engineer or
emulate with a fake environment and this

103
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:31,329
is a sandbox is also wrong but so are
around us on daily basis reuse them but

104
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:39,080
we don't you we are not focusing enough
of this is a honey but this is a very

105
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,540
very very good cause I really believe in
this if you miss what miles my stuff

106
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,880
own miss with you while I'm sleeping
because I'm too lazy so most of the

107
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,130
times I'm lazy I love the meeting my
stuff most of my stuff are automated and

108
00:09:53,130 --> 00:10:00,740
I'm very lazy so I don't want to get up
and respond to and i dont offense so why

109
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,730
are we gonna put to frustrate a
malicious user y to frustrate a

110
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,520
malicious user when you can make your
life miserable

111
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:17,090
this is one of the things and and the
good thing is that if he's attacking me

112
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:23,690
I have all the right topic and I'm not
letting him down so what happened is

113
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,380
that he attacks me and in the same time
he gets it while he's attacking me

114
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,990
also why'd you get your valuable
information stolen result knowing who

115
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,000
really did it most of the time pressures
have been all over the world and what we

116
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,580
do with this happens we hire an incident
response company which comes and

117
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:49,020
investigate and the end up by ok this is
like the others and this guy was behind

118
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:56,329
two or 3 p.m. and it might be a month my
might be so for you to detect and know

119
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,990
exactly who did this to environment
you'll never be 100% sure but in this

120
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,500
case you will also to collect limited
information we collect limited

121
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,260
information about malicious users when
you're playing good at all so we

122
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,580
understand the mechanisms what that
tucker want for my environment what he

123
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,090
wants for my business but the
information you get the so limited and

124
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,560
you can get more information if you have
already a full access to the attackers

125
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,550
machine and the last last but not least
way to be reactive to cyber breaches

126
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,880
when you can be proactive and control
the entire beach from your own

127
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,730
perspective so there's two kinds of
security and I believe and the last one

128
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,280
so there's better defense and I guess
this is already did we have to do this

129
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:47,280
for all ages we keep implementing
firewalls IDS IDSs solutions we get a

130
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,260
lot of people to see the kind of traffic
that goes in and goes out of our network

131
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:58,430
and eventually get preached so this was
nice maybe in 1999 or 2000 but these

132
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,680
days we need an active defense we need
to understand what's compromising on

133
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,650
network and even if we are not being
back at least we need to see a full

134
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,670
picture of what's going on in our
environment so active defense is

135
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:20,439
offensive and in the same time it's the
fence so you are defending you and it

136
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,950
would but actively

137
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:30,280
so how you can detect and that they're
actually I found that it's pretty easy

138
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,380
most of the disease and a lot of network
attacks so what time is that the

139
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,210
malicious traffic constructed from a
network security solutions and ideas

140
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:48,500
ideas they saw my security solutions my
environment and attack but doesn't know

141
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:57,540
it's a false positive or whatever and so
we have two choices right now it's

142
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:04,520
midnight or a persistent Parker who are
doing this manually so the Hollywood

143
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,350
star's wife validating if they're going
at the moment we conducted by person and

144
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,750
this is the most important port we don't
want to talk about we don't want to

145
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,760
attack someone in the middle has been a
business machine gets abused and he's

146
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,150
doing attack on that because we have we
need to fully know that we are attacking

147
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:28,630
the person who's doing this once the
honey products and validates which kind

148
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,000
of user is going was playing with the
network it will activate the base of the

149
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,780
fence so the best defense it's one of
those things so it's on to me that it

150
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,280
will slow down so for example for this
kind of behavior and scanning all ports

151
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,750
on trying to follow it will make it very
slow very slow very slow very slow

152
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:51,810
losing a lot of suspicious and if it's
and if it was a manually conducted in

153
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:59,459
the honey pot would respond on opens but
only on the case of Emmanuel Beach will

154
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,340
do it will reading the traffic once
again another report and this one is a

155
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:14,990
little bit interesting so that's how I
like to call the exploitation and and

156
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:20,090
this exact hunt put all boards will be
closed up about 80 from a server

157
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,500
prospective data cannot be able to
compromise it from a server or network

158
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:30,220
side so what does tackle do he will open
his presidency what's going on right

159
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:36,000
and that's exactly what I want them to
do so the attacker voluntarily change

160
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,680
his attack from a little attacked a web
application and this is when he turns

161
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,510
into a clueless victim so from the whip
through their get fingerprinted and

162
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,670
exploited automatically in the middle of
his attempts to Cebu discovered

163
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:57,810
application so I tried as much as they
can to take that actual network totally

164
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,380
neutral perspective but it's too much
work and I guess it's like a little a

165
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,290
little bit hard to me because you have
to discovered open port 22 recognizes

166
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,569
you have to do is click Asian and some
of these steps gonna take a lot of time

167
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:18,230
to meet I'm working on it right now but
I didn't nail it just so I move it to

168
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,100
our web application I think so

169
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,630
depicting an attack and application
living so how we did the friends at the

170
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,670
kitchen table saw

171
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,969
moshus user traffic gets routed through
the application security solutions like

172
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,840
a way for example or we can implement
some custom traps and I do this all the

173
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,030
time it's pretty fun so how we can
implement custom tracks and our web

174
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,370
application that is a lot of ideas but
those are the main story ideas reviews

175
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,010
these days are so I use honey tokens so
am i that Arbys if the application every

176
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,410
publication these days he's at the
beaten track tried and of course there's

177
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:02,719
an admin user reviews already won right
so what I do that I make an admin user

178
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,050
and changed his name from admin to Alice
or Adam or something else and I remove

179
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:15,410
anything in the given this user is an e3
to make it all numbers and the first

180
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,920
user on the data is a make it like
administrator and in the strict gun

181
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,760
description I can call it God
administrative control everything and

182
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,300
they come put the password for it like
very easy to break into five or

183
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,459
something but hillary and what happened
is that once an attacker compromises

184
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,700
made that he is he will just like
automatically good for the first entry

185
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,819
with was user ID number one target user

186
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:45,269
he will try not to take it and some kid
was a replication and this is when he

187
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:51,769
gets elected so at this point the
malicious user try to use my decoy and

188
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:56,079
that's when I get ultra and I know that
there is a debate speech and I can at

189
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:56,878
this point

190
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:02,789
entire application thread you are also
there is something called honey pages

191
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:09,879
and images are very interesting also saw
you can inject some secret beaches on

192
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:16,519
the comments you know or hidden values
and make it very invisible for people

193
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:22,829
normal people to favoring cord and he
can use the island for a position that

194
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,888
there's someone is going manuals for
your bitches viewing your source code

195
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:28,709
what's going on and

196
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:34,710
course Dr Dunedin entries which are
published on the main level and they can

197
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,519
use to identify and actively concerts or
discovery

198
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,879
responded to an application of INS's
very easy saw that advocates resulted

199
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:47,399
once more from the honey boo or directly
from the web application to the

200
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:53,508
exploitation again environment and so
were busy so he got fingerprinted and so

201
00:17:53,509 --> 00:18:00,779
at the defense equals of insecurities
plus artificial intelligence

202
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:06,259
it's it's pretty hard I know that a lot
of people say that I can pull this off

203
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:11,669
but I would do that I have a working
proof of concept for this so how

204
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:17,850
logically it can be done so let's let's
take it very easy very simple and I

205
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:24,529
would break it down for you so in
addition starts was what we we identify

206
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:34,980
exploit right and we begged to insured
for their access is this point sometimes

207
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,200
who she is a lot of problems for example
the malicious user these days We R 2006

208
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,179
2016 storm damages users will never come
to you using the Clean computable mean

209
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,620
they will

210
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:54,939
billion or intermediate system to break
into a little so right now we need to

211
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,400
understand what should be done to
unravel identity of this user and

212
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,830
exploit a system and as two different
phases so for the attack we need to be

213
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,970
unwise first we need to identify the
user and we need to intimidate him

214
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:20,470
exploit him leading privileges and being
persistent minimizing the user can

215
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:27,120
easily happen using or focusing on
client-side attacks so every president

216
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:34,689
has weakness right all of us use your
kids these days although I know that if

217
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,150
I ask that everyone with his hands

218
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:43,640
JavaScript some of us are using Flash
maybe job also some media players on

219
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:50,350
their browser and I wrote a model for
dynamic detector is basically is abusing

220
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,439
these kind of processors just kind of
browser plug-ins and frozen

221
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,120
functionality and abusing some
functionality at a team of five to

222
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,860
leverage the real identity of a user was
browsing through my servers and systems

223
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:16,830
and then there's a very pretty smart so
it's has a very friendly name it's not

224
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:22,530
fair and it's a very sophisticated model
can effectively and mostly

225
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,629
organized attack and profile which I
call ed IBP

226
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,179
malicious users are basically behind
towards the pions or proxies and even if

227
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:38,440
a user is a using an intermediate system
i still can reveal his identity so

228
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,429
what's new features of the neglect of
the arm I think any malicious user

229
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:50,120
flawlessly and accurately on the flight
so you visit a bitch to 2nd annual

230
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,199
identity has been reviewed it's also
committed to identifying malicious users

231
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,010
IP address

232
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,590
country city and coordinates of course
of course will not be so accurate

233
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:06,580
because it's based on the provider which
are giving you but you can say is like

234
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,860
200 and 300 miles accurate are also it
can enrich malicious users machine and

235
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,330
put every single weekend and when I say
everything weakness I'm not talking

236
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,750
about server-side I'm talking about your
present so you for example using IE six

237
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,180
and you have X number of displays
available using flash and will try to

238
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,230
exploit everyone on the File Export
skirts but after of course the amazing

239
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:36,550
machine it's also capable of exploiting
every single week identified so it will

240
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,080
I don't fight it will do in relation to
reduce predation of 3rd generalizing

241
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,879
your machine and it will clear
privileges under most operating systems

242
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,860
despite the political controls so
imagine was one click

243
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,840
he's gone and also it's capable of
maintaining access and things to see

244
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,360
even in the more strict environments and
I had to write a lot of custom code for

245
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:07,169
this whole up its campaign come to file
its ministers and with the delectable

246
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:14,450
and it can put some resistance in trees
on his machine so I use five different

247
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,580
techniques that the machine persistent
cookies html5 local storage vesicles

248
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,179
local storage so I have like five
different mechanisms to make sure that

249
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,960
when he comes back I know that this guy
who came before he was doing wonders for

250
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:38,300
this is exactly works so I have a back
injury right this guy was the black hat

251
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:47,080
anyway so I have a concern as you can
see and the backend server has six

252
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,800
models so I have identification
enumeration exploitation is collision

253
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,680
and resistance and alice is all
malicious user

254
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:05,450
I choose a friendly name here and alice
is using tools to attack my network and

255
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:11,610
from here she jump in the first half
second top serb hope and my honey but

256
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:18,889
give her this way peach I'm from there I
can identify and exploit is cleared my

257
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,850
privilege and being persistent and
mechanical flaws back over unencrypted

258
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,780
medium so for her even if she has
security will simply if she's a very bad

259
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:35,360
situation so right now I've been able to
successfully delivered a balloon to

260
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,820
Allison machine and she doesn't even
know so she think that she's fully

261
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,260
anonymous but her traffic got forwarded
to a web page and all of the sudden

262
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,990
machines not his anymore unfortunately I
am putting some technical issues with my

263
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:56,530
own server I have the so-called working
I wanted to really wanted to demonstrate

264
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,649
it to you I didn't before but I don't
know what's going on with it i think is

265
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,080
like something to do with more security
was ever saw a lot of serious security

266
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,860
myself and give me a very hard time
that's why my presentation got delayed

267
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,350
for a bit but anyway I'm working on it
maybe in like 30 minutes or less than an

268
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,870
hour I cannot meet again and I
demonstrated you on the plate with 12

269
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:24,790
minutes maximum if it's possible of
course other guys are so yeah that's the

270
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:32,040
last but not least I would like to thank
my direct manager my best friend for

271
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:38,570
pushing for all the way but Russia and
showing me the light where to store them

272
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,929
dork and I would also like to thank the
organizers

273
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:47,720
especially those lines guys Andrea and
thank you so much
