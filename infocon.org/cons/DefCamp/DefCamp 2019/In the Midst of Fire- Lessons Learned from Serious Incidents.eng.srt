1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,758
so welcome thank you for joining me I

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:07,230
appreciate this is a tough slog we're

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,700
just before lunchtime and it's nice to

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,710
see people actually coming in rather

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,559
than leaving and so I'll try and keep

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,570
this on time my name is Chris Yule I'm

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,680
one of the senior security researchers

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,650
at SecureWorks

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,448
I am based in Edinburgh in Scotland I

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,930
arrived here two days ago so it's great

11
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,930
to be here

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,769
hopefully my mic is working yeah as we

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,630
just said SecureWorks is a company that

14
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,420
monitors thousands of organizations

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,940
around the world my job the research

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,219
teams job is to watch what's happening

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,399
and then figure out trends and basically

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,530
generate threat intelligence from that

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,390
we see a lot of interesting failures and

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,899
we're going to talk about some of those

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,829
today you might be thinking if you don't

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,690
know SecureWorks

23
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,550
how do we have authority to talk about

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,480
this SecureWorks has huge amounts of

25
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,328
visibility and we have three main types

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,459
of visibility we have a lot of logs we

27
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,010
have custom we have customers in over 55

28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,330
countries around the world just under

29
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,570
four and a half thousand organizations

30
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,869
whose infrastructure we monitor we

31
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,809
collect about 320 billion security

32
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,030
events from them every day and we store

33
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,680
that for 90 days and originally name

34
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,630
database called vldb

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,240
very large database we didn't get

36
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,429
marketing involved in that one and

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,530
that's about 6 petabytes of security

38
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,939
event data that we have in our data

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,950
center we have endpoint telemetry so we

40
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,289
have our endpoint agent that we call red

41
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,079
cloak and we have red cloak deployed on

42
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,170
two million agents two million endpoints

43
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,539
around the world and red cloak that's

44
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,090
really not very clear and red cloak

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,009
gives us full visibility of all activity

46
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,450
on the endpoint command history process

47
00:01:53,009 --> 00:02:00,240
history and memory etc so in this case

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,009
which you probably can't read we can see

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,199
PowerShell being run from a command

50
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,600
shell which was spawned by word which

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,239
was spawned by Firefox which was spawned

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,640
by Outlook so clearly a full command

53
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,920
chain history there of a phishing attack

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,958
leading to

55
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,440
malicious attachment so we have a lot of

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,380
endpoint visibility we also deal with a

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,480
lot of incidents so I'm based in the UK

58
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,130
this is a UK slide and so we're

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,190
certified by the UK government to

60
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:30,709
respond to advanced cyberattacks against

61
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,470
national infrastructure these kinds of

62
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,640
certifications mean that we get the

63
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,300
phone call when some of the most

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,369
interesting incidents happen and a lot

65
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,260
of the the most valuable intelligence

66
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,180
that we get comes from working our

67
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,120
Incident Response engagements we're

68
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,300
seeing firsthand what some of the

69
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,280
advanced adversaries today are doing if

70
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,430
I wish to distill all that into a tweet

71
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:01,819
I would say that secure works those data

72
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:03,650
we have the best data okay

73
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,829
so what I want to talk to you about

74
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,049
today is if you're a network defender

75
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,440
what is it that should be keeping you

76
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:14,090
awake today what's the thing that should

77
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,799
be lurking in your dreams that might

78
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,170
happen tomorrow and

79
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,140
normally when we do these these sort of

80
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,059
threat landscape briefings we used to

81
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,589
talk about nation-state attacks we

82
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,579
talked about whole series of different

83
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,680
interesting things this year we've kind

84
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:33,410
of evolved to be talking about just one

85
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,829
thing because of how seriously we're

86
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:40,160
treating it that is post intrusion

87
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:41,810
ransomware attacks some of the ones you

88
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,609
may have seen in the news until it

89
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,620
started a few years to go with samsam

90
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:47,329
attacks targeting and a bunch of

91
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,019
hospitals and health care providers in

92
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:51,500
the u.s. earlier this year we had you

93
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,989
defense

94
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,400
scientific which didn't go widely

95
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,400
reported but actually had a massive

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,130
impact this was a global forensics

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,680
company that in the UK it turns out they

98
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,829
were taking 80% of the the forensics

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,980
work for the police

100
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:16,830
DNA the blood Sachin Bansal Sardar is

101
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:20,909
completely destroyed globally by we saw

102
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,740
being attacked we saw a bunch of local

103
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,980
government organizations in the US and

104
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,670
beyond being attacked earlier this year

105
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,900
we had norsk hydro and aluminium

106
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,600
manufacturer completely disabled

107
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,400
globally by a local NGO ransomware

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,840
attack

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,270
we had baltimore attacks earlier this

110
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,200
year and just to keep it fresh this was

111
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,810
three days ago

112
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,880
so Everest is a managed security a

113
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,850
managed service provider I think it's a

114
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,850
subsidiary of NTT so they were hit by

115
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:55,380
bit paper ransomware and also a large

116
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:57,500
radio network in Spain we continue to

117
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,659
see post intrusion ransomware attacks

118
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,600
having the single biggest impact on our

119
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,550
customers when it hits it doesn't hit

120
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,930
everybody and but we are so we have seen

121
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,870
a massive increase in the number of

122
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,860
attacks and when it does hit the impact

123
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,570
is generally catastrophic so if we look

124
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,900
at a time line of the kind of the main

125
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:22,380
things that we've been seeing so this

126
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,109
kind of started in 2015 with the samsung

127
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,840
ransomware family so that's a threat

128
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,460
group that we call gold level and so as

129
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,729
a threat intelligence company we have to

130
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,349
give ridiculous names to threat groups

131
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,940
the gold the gold groups are the the

132
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,780
criminal groups that are trying to to

133
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,940
make money so particularly in 2018 they

134
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,700
became very active and made a fair

135
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,729
amount of money the turn it was to

136
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,740
Iranian guys who were probably

137
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:52,200
associated with the Iranian Revolution

138
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,210
regards launching a side gig to make

139
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,030
millions of dollars they were indicted

140
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:01,820
by the FBI in 2018 and then immediately

141
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,820
in the Samsun attacks stopped which was

142
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,050
then really summer last years when

143
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,300
things kicked into overdrive so we had

144
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:14,479
the gold rate group with bitpay myrrh

145
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:18,570
we had Rio appear in August of last year

146
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,840
defray November locker Goga started

147
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,659
hitting

148
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,549
organizations earlier this year

149
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,800
targeting a number of manufacturing and

150
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:29,190
engineering companies in Europe and the

151
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,389
US although since March April we haven't

152
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,460
really seen much of loca Koga Robin

153
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,380
Hoods earlier this year and then

154
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,169
latterly we've seen a big spike in

155
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,469
attacks with Riva lor Cedeno key B or

156
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:45,810
whatever you want to call it and these

157
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,720
are kind of the main groups that we've

158
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,270
seen using post intrusion ransomware and

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,700
they're making a lot of money in our

160
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,359
experience the one I'm gonna focus on

161
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,219
most is is Rio I think I haven't done a

162
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,460
count of the number of incidents but so

163
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,220
we do 700 incidents a year globally for

164
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,380
our customers Incident Response and I

165
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,150
would estimate that post intrusion

166
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,820
ransomware this year alone is probably

167
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,900
in the region of 30 to 50 organizations

168
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,510
that have been hit by one of these

169
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,919
families and Ryu because by far being

170
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,449
the the stand-out family within that so

171
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,940
what do we mean when we say post

172
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:29,760
intrusion ransomware and we used to call

173
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:31,979
it targeted ransomware the idea that it

174
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,530
was more of a kind of apt style attack

175
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,190
so so where before we had crime groups

176
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,169
using commodity malware to steal banking

177
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,840
true banking account details try and get

178
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,639
small amounts of money and we saw them

179
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,520
move to this model of using more

180
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,710
targeted attack styles of gaining access

181
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,260
to the environment having actual hands

182
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,909
on keyboards and trying to do privilege

183
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,430
escalation achieve freedom of movement

184
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,830
understand the environment get as much

185
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,700
access as possible and then deploy the

186
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:05,070
ransomware globally to switch on or in

187
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,930
one hour so essentially you're disabling

188
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,580
the entire organization almost

189
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:13,200
immediately if you've remained

190
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:15,359
undetected so that's kind of the the

191
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,979
general model that they all use I want

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,660
to walk you through some case studies

193
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,659
with ryuk

194
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,558
so the first interesting thing to note

195
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:30,319
about ryuk is that the initial

196
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:32,269
compromise almost always seems to come

197
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,089
from what we would have previously

198
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,769
called a commodity malware infection so

199
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:38,959
something like a motet or something like

200
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:41,929
trick bought to malware families that we

201
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,660
see widely distributed by spam and not

202
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:47,750
targeted just wide net trying to get as

203
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,120
many organizations as possible we see

204
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,790
eMeter leading to trick poor infections

205
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,339
and then over time we then see some of

206
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:58,790
those trick bot infections leads to ryuk

207
00:08:55,339 --> 00:09:00,649
compromises in this case this this

208
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,899
organization and this was in March or

209
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,810
April this year this was an oil and gas

210
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,310
retail company in North America with

211
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,069
revenues of about a hundred million

212
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:14,209
dollars annually they were completely

213
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:16,279
destroyed globally by ryuk so they had

214
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:19,250
had a motor and trick bot running in

215
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:22,010
their environment for about 48 days and

216
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,870
then suddenly on day 4 to 8 we see a

217
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,810
whole different suite of activities and

218
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,709
network scanning PowerShell Empire being

219
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,839
used to disable endpoint controls and

220
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,369
just much more intense access where

221
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,260
previously tricked by I've just been

222
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,269
running like malware tends to do

223
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,790
stealing credentials exfiltrating stuff

224
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:42,889
automatically suddenly we see a whole

225
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,740
suite of hands on keyboard threat actor

226
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:47,930
activity we don't know for sure why that

227
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,740
is but the the logical assumption seems

228
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:55,069
to be that the group behind ryuk gold

229
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,410
Oelrichs are paying for access so the

230
00:09:55,069 --> 00:10:00,649
trick by operators have a botnet of

231
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,300
compromised systems the riot guys choose

232
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,459
which systems they want to potentially

233
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,260
target with ryuk they pay for access and

234
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:09,290
they use drier because a route into the

235
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,750
environment so the key to remember is so

236
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,500
a motet and trick bots don't always lead

237
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,769
to ryuk

238
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,380
but ryuk is always preface by a motet or

239
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:22,730
trick bot so it seems clear there's two

240
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:25,639
groups in operation there so in this

241
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,769
organization they've had a malware

242
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:32,029
infection for 48 days and then suddenly

243
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:33,769
we see a whole flurry of activity and so

244
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:35,510
they already have the admin and service

245
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:36,019
account trick bar has been operating in

246
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,459
the back

247
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,040
stealing whatever credentials that can

248
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:42,709
find we see them using trick bot to get

249
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,559
into the environment using pig to check

250
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:49,189
roots identified domain controllers lots

251
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:50,569
of use of remote desktop PS exec and so

252
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,610
no malware at this point this is just

253
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:54,410
somewhere in the environment living off

254
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,079
the land using the native operating

255
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:01,429
system tools to to move around and

256
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:03,738
understand the environment we saw them

257
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:05,299
using blood tanks or blood time as a

258
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:08,029
tool that you can use to visualize

259
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:10,189
Active Directory so really trying to

260
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:12,079
understand whether they're the source

261
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:16,939
systems where are the key systems to

262
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:19,329
access for a compromise we see them very

263
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:21,829
minimal intrusion no additional malware

264
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:25,969
just really building an understanding of

265
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:30,258
the environment so then at 9 p.m. local

266
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:32,389
time on day 49 so less than 24 hours

267
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:34,579
after we see this group first get into

268
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:37,009
the environment we then start seeing

269
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:39,378
them staging their tools onto the domain

270
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:41,389
controller and when we say tools were

271
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:44,299
using the - the word tools very loosely

272
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:48,709
there's nothing massively sophisticated

273
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:50,629
going on here so we see them deploying a

274
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,998
bunch of text files so every text file

275
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:54,410
contains a number of host names so it's

276
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,670
basically a list of all the host names

277
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,639
in the environment that they want to

278
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:01,490
deploy the ransomware to and we see them

279
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,149
deploying scripts that run PS exec on

280
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,699
every system in the text files to deploy

281
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:11,029
the ryouko binary to the the temp folder

282
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:12,889
of every system in the network and they

283
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:18,049
deploy a script that when they run it

284
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:20,839
will initiate their the ryuk binary so

285
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:23,299
very very simple scripts the ryuk binary

286
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,100
is not massively sophisticated it just

287
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:27,199
does what it needs to do it's just on

288
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,059
one system doesn't move laterally or

289
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:33,618
anything it just encrypts everything

290
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:36,259
that it finds so then on day 50 less

291
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:38,480
than 48 hours after their initial access

292
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:40,999
and they come in using stolen admin

293
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,679
credentials they manually check the

294
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:45,259
backup to see if they can get access to

295
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:48,439
the backup to also encrypt those and

296
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:49,610
then they deploy the riot ransomware on

297
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:52,279
pretty much every

298
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,050
host in the environment and that is

299
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,600
generally not a good day in the office

300
00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:01,939
if you are defending a network when that

301
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:04,010
happens so that's one case study of many

302
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,070
that we have done in the last year and

303
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,890
beyond so we have done a lot of first

304
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,120
hand work in some of these chaotic

305
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:13,100
environments that have suffered

306
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,860
catastrophic attacks from from these

307
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:20,420
malware families so what have we learned

308
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,660
that sounds scary when you essentially

309
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,790
have a 40-hour window with an operator

310
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,610
who isn't really using very much malware

311
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,339
you have 48 hours to detect them and

312
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,899
stop them as an industry we often think

313
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:34,430
that we have failed when we have the

314
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,829
first malware infection if we get

315
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,560
malware on the machine then we failed

316
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:41,060
but actually in that case we had a 50

317
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,160
day window from the malware being

318
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,540
deployed to potentially stopping that

319
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,010
actor from achieving their objectives

320
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,800
and giving us a very bad day so we have

321
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,560
had some success of detecting and

322
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,660
stopping these kinds of attacks

323
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,119
we helped respond to one of the big

324
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Locker gogo attacks earlier this year I

325
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,040
was the Intel lead on that and so one of

326
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,899
the first things that we want to do is

327
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,250
get any intelligence that we can from

328
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:09,079
those incidents so that we can then

329
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,540
protect all of four and a half thousand

330
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:14,540
of our customers from that we were able

331
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,040
to get the IP addresses sorry my laser

332
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,370
pointer is not very good on here but

333
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,069
these white circles are or black circles

334
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,290
that are white and our IP addresses so

335
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,839
the IP addresses the attacker was using

336
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,329
to get into the environment we use a

337
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,120
data visualization tool called a

338
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:34,310
labyrinth I can drop the IP address and

339
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,050
query all of our data sources and

340
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,410
immediately I can see so these green

341
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,479
dots are vldb log instances where our

342
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,959
customers have been talking to the IP

343
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:49,010
address and this Big Sur cluster of

344
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:51,500
activity here are our our IDs signatures

345
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,019
and that hate for the IP address and

346
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,680
these IDs signatures are for cobalt

347
00:14:54,019 --> 00:15:00,380
strike so here I can see that I have top

348
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,589
right and in the middle left there two

349
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:07,610
customers that have vldb log traffic to

350
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:10,040
IP address and also IDs hits for cobalt

351
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,510
strike to that IP address and we knew

352
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,939
there in the locker gogo instance that

353
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,490
we'd seen they were using cobalt strike

354
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,520
and I should say both of these things

355
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,260
were about one month previously so let's

356
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,610
assume this was the star of April these

357
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,800
hits had happened at the beginning of

358
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,839
March and we had detected those and

359
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,410
escalated those to those customers at

360
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,760
that time but aren't with this new

361
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,980
information that this is not just

362
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,930
bog-standard cobalt strike this is

363
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,480
potentially a precursor to a massive

364
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,209
ransomware incident we got on the phone

365
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,660
to these customers and said just to warn

366
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,940
you we now have extra intelligence on

367
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,010
those IP addresses it turned out that

368
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,350
both customers had responded to the

369
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,290
information that we gave them one of

370
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,600
them was successful in launching IR to

371
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,689
essentially evict the operator from

372
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,520
their network the other was unsuccessful

373
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,970
and they had a very bad day after they

374
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,579
had a locker go by ransomware attack and

375
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,440
so kind of a success story we were able

376
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,000
to tell customers that something bad was

377
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,130
happening one of them was able to block

378
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,940
it one of them wasn't and just to keep

379
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:22,400
things fresh so this was last Sunday and

380
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:25,670
we my team so we're the CTU kick the

381
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,220
cyber intelligence cell and so one of

382
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,040
our threat hunters was looking at the

383
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:33,800
red claw portal just for some hit States

384
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,740
it's seen happening and realized that

385
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,270
we'd escalated to an organization who

386
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,370
obviously can't name but they are the

387
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,350
very definition of a global organization

388
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,820
if this became a global ransomware

389
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,420
incident this was going to be a massive

390
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,490
news story so last Sunday he detected a

391
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,099
red cloak triggering on a bunch of

392
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,430
things that were good precursors of a

393
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,500
Rio ransomware attack and our sock had

394
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,300
escalated to the customer but as I'm

395
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,650
sure many of you know sometimes tickets

396
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,969
it's difficult to know which are the

397
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:05,329
important ones and which ones are not

398
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,650
the important ones and so we had one of

399
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,428
our team had a personal relationship

400
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:13,250
with the the CIO at that organization so

401
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,260
we got on the phone with them and less

402
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,750
than 24 hours later that company had

403
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,640
stood up its IRT

404
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,630
they engaged us for incident response

405
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,699
and we continue to see red cloak just

406
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,709
lights up in this organization for

407
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:30,950
everything that we expect to see with a

408
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:32,809
ryuk attack so at this stage we're it's

409
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,490
genuinely touch-and-go we think the

410
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:37,190
actors in the environment we normally

411
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,380
have about 40 hours riot could hit them

412
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,510
at any moment and so we don't really

413
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,520
know how it's going to go but luckily

414
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,110
last week this was a good news story for

415
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,530
us we were able to use red cloak to

416
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,299
triage the damage we identified 79 hosts

417
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,010
with tripod indicators they were

418
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:55,129
isolated from the environment and

419
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:58,610
blocked from the Internet we identified

420
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,530
53 other hosts that had showed logins by

421
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,389
the threat actor and which is an

422
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,980
indication that they the credentials

423
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,559
were compromised but not necessarily

424
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,700
those systems so that initiated a global

425
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,010
password reset throughout the

426
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,960
organization and then we saw another

427
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,660
hundred or so systems that showed

428
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,940
evidence of reconnaissance within the

429
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,040
environment so again no evidence that

430
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,169
those systems had been compromised so

431
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,850
that allowed us to focus remediation on

432
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:25,370
the systems that we knew were

433
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,199
compromised do a global password reset

434
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,389
so if any credentials had been stolen

435
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,980
they were no longer valid and I don't

436
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,140
want the temp fake if this is still an

437
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,150
active incident but so far there has

438
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,429
been no ryuk attack on this organization

439
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,710
and so that's a massive success for us

440
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,630
we were pleased with that these were all

441
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,790
of the countermeasures that we have in

442
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:47,090
red cloak that triggered within that

443
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:49,610
customer over a 24 hour period and which

444
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,649
shows you that I mean we see a red cloak

445
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,120
as an agent of a thousand tripwire so

446
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,179
these are the trip wires that the actor

447
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,100
triggered in that environment which

448
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:59,600
shows us that is it is difficult to

449
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,559
detect these things and stop them from

450
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,299
happening once they're in the

451
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,160
environment but it is absolutely

452
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:08,990
possible if you're instrumented to look

453
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:11,179
for these kinds of behaviors believe it

454
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,179
or not if this happens your IR planning

455
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:16,730
will absolutely be put to the test we

456
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:19,429
have seen some fantastic examples of

457
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,049
massive successes and massive failures

458
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,750
when it comes to Incident Response and

459
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:25,970
these kinds of incidents one Locker

460
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:30,559
gorga attack that we had earlier this

461
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:31,250
year and we went on site we weren't

462
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,260
doing the incident

463
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,050
response but the organization had asked

464
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,580
us as they rebuilt systems to deploy red

465
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,180
cloak to them so that we could monitor

466
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,379
for any residual threat actor activity

467
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,870
so we went on site to help the

468
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,480
organization when we were on site we

469
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,820
found the customers own in-house

470
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,140
security management team they had their

471
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,860
existing managed security services

472
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:57,110
provider on site who were uk-based they

473
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,000
had engaged a local incident response

474
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,750
company local to their headquarters to

475
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,390
do the the forensics they had a big for

476
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,220
advisory consultant team on site they

477
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,320
had flown their in-house sock from

478
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,690
Eastern Europe to their headquarters and

479
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,370
they had also on-site deploying red

480
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,020
cloak and trying to help them figure out

481
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,870
if there was anything still compromised

482
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,610
there was various IT consultants helping

483
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,979
just to rebuild systems that had been

484
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,659
destroyed and there was reps from pretty

485
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,490
much every security vendor that you

486
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,860
could count their antivirus vendor their

487
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,240
firewall vendor their proxy vendor I

488
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:34,990
don't know what they were hoping to do

489
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:37,460
but they were there they had of course

490
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:40,130
zero usable IT infrastructure everything

491
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,230
had been destroyed no clarity and he was

492
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,000
running the show and and also the

493
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,560
politics of shame so you have secured

494
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,630
works as a managed security service

495
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,639
provider coming in with a new product

496
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,410
like red cloak to show off to the

497
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,880
customer how good we are you have the

498
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,160
existing managed security service

499
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,050
provider who is probably out going has

500
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,010
clearly not seen something that could

501
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,159
have prevented this attack from

502
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,600
happening it wasn't the most

503
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,020
conciliatory environment shall we say

504
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:09,679
there was a lot of politics going on

505
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,240
within that and so if you can imagine in

506
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,400
your organization if this happens and

507
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,710
you have all these people on site does

508
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,630
your IR plan live up to scrutiny will

509
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,340
you know how to handle that kind of

510
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:23,570
thing when you have no IT infrastructure

511
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:26,149
to rely on one of the key things is to

512
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,350
have an incident commander and this is

513
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,170
something that we've been doing for the

514
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,449
last 18 months or so so we've we've been

515
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:33,890
doing Incident Response for years and we

516
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,260
have a lot of fantastic technical

517
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,970
Incident Response consultants what we

518
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,750
see though is customers expecting

519
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,930
technical consultants to do large-scale

520
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,030
management of incidents

521
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,790
it's a very different skillset to doing

522
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,440
forensics and an incident to doing

523
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,240
coordination and management and so we

524
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,610
now have some very senior people that we

525
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,290
offer as consultants for to manage

526
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,570
large-scale incidents like this and

527
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,950
often customers say to us no we can't

528
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,409
afford that we don't want to pay for

529
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,940
that and then we've sent them a

530
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,200
technical consultant and they expect the

531
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,550
technical consultants to do all the

532
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,770
project management when you should be

533
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,139
looking at logs and forensics and things

534
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,850
like that so so absolutely as part of

535
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,960
your I are planning make sure that you

536
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,969
have accounted for the fact that

537
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,050
somebody needs to be in charge of

538
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,420
coordinating that so a good example the

539
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:25,370
Situation Room US government maybe not a

540
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,370
good example with use in charge but

541
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,430
there needs to be clear accountability

542
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,379
who's in charge who are the people

543
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,080
around the table who do they report to

544
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,430
how do they communicate and we often get

545
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,860
customers saying well what what does an

546
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:40,080
incident response plan look like and our

547
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,870
consultants help you build if you want

548
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,090
your ir plans this is a screenshot I did

549
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,860
from one customer that we did these were

550
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,169
all of the documents that we created as

551
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,879
part of the ir plan and probably the

552
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,070
most important is making sure you know

553
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,810
what the organizational chart is what

554
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,179
the rules and responsibilities are and

555
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:59,550
how you communicate amongst teams if and

556
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:02,210
when you have no longer access to email

557
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:06,240
and things like that

558
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:08,240
and of course rehearsing your incident

559
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,340
response procedures is important and

560
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,710
tabletop exercises planning for what

561
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,090
happens in a ransomware incident and if

562
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,070
you can come up with a good plan and a

563
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,379
good scenario that you can engage all

564
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,270
the stakeholders in to rehearse this I

565
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,660
promise you having seen it go badly

566
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,120
wrong

567
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,630
is absolutely worthwhile doing that if

568
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,750
you can so one other thing that we've

569
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,840
learned and identifying when you've got

570
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,070
incidents left right and center and

571
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,899
sometimes we do a good job of filtering

572
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,870
out the false positives but even if you

573
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,390
only have true positive incidents

574
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,909
identifying which of those are a low

575
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,370
priority one and which of those leads to

576
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,820
oh my god we need to move right now

577
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,620
it's really hard thing to do and very

578
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,870
often you have security analysts in the

579
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,070
sock who are can't see the route for the

580
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,779
trees they're there

581
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,369
looking at individual incidents of

582
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,470
things that have gone wrong individually

583
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:03,359
but without taking a step back and

584
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,690
really understanding what the big

585
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,759
picture isn't what this might mean

586
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,549
good examples we often see em sock

587
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:13,080
procedures and that say if we raise a

588
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:14,549
ticket to them and the whole point of

589
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,279
hiring asses that we're supposed to know

590
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:18,899
more than than others if we raise a

591
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,700
ticket to them they'll run a virus gown

592
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:22,018
if the virus Gann says no I didn't find

593
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,539
anything they'll close the ticket it's a

594
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:26,159
false positive the whole point of paying

595
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,749
us is that we're better than antivirus

596
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,149
so antivirus is a low level security

597
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:33,539
control it's crazy how often we see that

598
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:36,349
happen and so one case this was a global

599
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:39,299
travel company who we also saw and

600
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:42,658
indicators of a riot compromised earlier

601
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:44,668
this year so our Incident Response

602
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,200
consultant was engaged with the local

603
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:48,989
stock analyst he was dealing with a very

604
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,999
small incident that I our consultant

605
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:53,190
knew that the indicators that we were

606
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:55,649
seeing were indicators of a much bigger

607
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,269
compromise that had to be looked at you

608
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:58,649
have to persuade the sake analyst you

609
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:00,690
need to escalate there's to your

610
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:02,820
management so eventually the IR

611
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:04,049
consultant is then dealing with a local

612
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,658
in-country seizo

613
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:08,279
we can see that the compromised accounts

614
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:10,470
are coming in from another country that

615
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,849
we don't have red cloak visibility of so

616
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,259
we're now trying to persuade the local

617
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,970
Caeser that we have to persuade the

618
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:17,639
other countries to deploy red cloak

619
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,129
eventually we're then dealing with

620
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:21,779
multiple regional Caesars and they're

621
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:23,639
all trying to coordinate until the IR

622
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:25,499
consultant goes this is a global

623
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:28,049
incident we need to invoke something and

624
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:30,320
then eventually after about 36 hours

625
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:32,700
were finally engaged with the global CIO

626
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,799
so that's really difficult thing to know

627
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,070
when is it appropriate the incident

628
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,450
needs to be escalated up the chain and

629
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,599
we are a producer of threat intelligence

630
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:44,249
we offer Ti subscriptions and one of the

631
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,470
things that we often hear customers say

632
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:48,470
to us is we don't know how to consume

633
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,580
the threat intelligence you produced

634
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,289
consuming threat Intel is very hard

635
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,989
there was a great presentation earlier

636
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:59,099
on one framework that you can use to do

637
00:25:54,989 --> 00:26:01,169
that but threat Intel is is more than

638
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,090
just taking indicators and applying it

639
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:05,909
to the tech things and create new

640
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,678
incidents Incident Response will be

641
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:09,080
better if you use threat Intel as a

642
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,640
result of that

643
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,949
and so here's another red cloak

644
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,420
screenshot so if we detect something

645
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,370
unusual in your environment and we

646
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,290
escalate it to you there's there's quite

647
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,060
a lot going on there so we've had to do

648
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,399
the research to know that this is bad

649
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,050
we've had to apply that knowledge in

650
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,690
terms of signatures and countermeasures

651
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,760
to red cloak we've had to then use red

652
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,290
cloak to detect that bad thing and then

653
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,750
we have processes and security

654
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:36,710
operations centers in place to then

655
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,420
escalate that to you so if you're using

656
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,760
managed security services hopefully

657
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,500
that's all an automated procedure but

658
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,750
that's actionable threat Intel that's I

659
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,270
was deploying something that says here's

660
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,590
something that you can block and go and

661
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,870
block it and let us know if you see it

662
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,730
but as I said it's also important that

663
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,550
if you are escalating something that

664
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:59,360
threat intelligence is used to support

665
00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:00,889
that so I was presenting something

666
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,780
similar this last year and I was trying

667
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,640
to think of a good example because we

668
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,470
often publish a lot of analyses on

669
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,990
different malware families and customers

670
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,760
say to us this is no use to me this is

671
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,610
like a 10 page detailed technical

672
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,410
document that says what bit paper does

673
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,270
or what a motet does I don't know how to

674
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,450
translate that into something that I can

675
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:22,430
use to block it you don't always have to

676
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,230
use it to block it you can use it so if

677
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,690
you have an MOT infection you can then

678
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,460
go and reference this document to tell

679
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,070
you what a motet is doing and how it's

680
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,300
it's doing that and so a good example

681
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,639
that I thought of to illustrate this

682
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,250
when I was in Florida last year and

683
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,620
hurricane Michael I think it was was

684
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,270
heading towards me and they were telling

685
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,669
me that it was going to be a category 3

686
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,250
hurricane I have no idea what a category

687
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,900
3 hurricane is but fortunately we have

688
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,240
the saffir-simpson hurricane scale which

689
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,030
tells you exactly what to expect

690
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,550
with different categories of hurricanes

691
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:57,410
you avert you have two very different

692
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,720
types of threat intelligence happening

693
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:01,130
there if I gave you all a page today and

694
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,260
said here's the saffir-simpson hurricane

695
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,250
scale you're probably not going to be

696
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,350
able to do very much with that

697
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,000
information but if somebody tells you

698
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,800
there's a category 3 hurricane coming

699
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,970
for you right now you're going to find

700
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,800
that bit of paper and you're going to

701
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,510
figure out what that means for you the

702
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,460
same is true for threat intelligence we

703
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,710
publish lots of different types of tea.i

704
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,210
some of it is telling you here's

705
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,290
something bad that might be coming for

706
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,490
you you should take that and you should

707
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,590
block it

708
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,510
a lot of it is just good contextual

709
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,490
information that if and when you hit

710
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,080
that you then have a reference of

711
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,090
knowledge that you can then go to and

712
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,120
use that to make your incident response

713
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,669
better incidents and intelligence should

714
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,580
feed off each other we learn week mu

715
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,960
threat intelligence by monitoring all

716
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,939
the incidents that our customers are

717
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,740
facing and trying to learn from that and

718
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,450
turn that into intelligence that

719
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,040
intelligence then allows us to generate

720
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,140
new incidents that we would never have

721
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,450
seen before and so the cycle continues

722
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,550
so we can do that but it's also

723
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,800
important that our customers and us

724
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:02,690
defenders are able to have that that

725
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:04,250
feedback loop across both functions one

726
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,809
another thing we've learned is that

727
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:09,230
paying the ransom doesn't make the

728
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:12,070
problem go away and we have seen

729
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:15,050
numerous organizations pay the ransom

730
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:17,330
the largest ransom that we have seen be

731
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:20,210
paid was earlier this year they paid

732
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,879
eight million dollars and to get the

733
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:26,630
decryption keys for their ransomware

734
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,970
attack and that was a Ryoka tack and we

735
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:31,190
then got the Decrypter for riot they

736
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,570
were I mean fair played for that if

737
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,990
they're very honest if you pay them they

738
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,970
generally do give you the Decrypter and

739
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,710
but if we saw how unsophisticated the

740
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,050
scripts they were using and the the

741
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,850
ransomware they were using was imagine

742
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,649
how unsophisticated the Decrypter is

743
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,959
going to be and with this organization

744
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:50,000
when we were very sleep-deprived and

745
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,470
helping them figure out how to do it one

746
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,600
of their sysadmin said I don't

747
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:56,030
understand why this Decrypter is so

748
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,800
terrible and this was basically a very

749
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:00,470
simple application that you had to

750
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,290
manually interactively run on one system

751
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:05,360
would you have 60,000 endpoints that are

752
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:07,309
globally disabled that is not an

753
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,740
effective way of bringing your systems

754
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:11,629
back up we ended up getting one of our

755
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,940
malware analysts to reverse-engineer the

756
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,860
Decrypter and change it so that we could

757
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,350
deploy it using Active Directory and

758
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,750
things across all systems it was not an

759
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:22,669
easy process so don't expect that you

760
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:27,230
can just pay the ransom and the problem

761
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:29,090
will go away and last of all I don't

762
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,550
think I do any presentation about

763
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:34,428
security without talking about this and

764
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,159
I apologize and but more often than not

765
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:37,960
it's the little things and I thought

766
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,930
we do little disparagingly it's the

767
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,300
security fundamentals that we see had

768
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:45,220
they been implemented properly most of

769
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,950
the serious attacks that we see would

770
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,900
have been prevented so what'll the

771
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:53,020
interesting will negate so if you're not

772
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,760
using Microsoft lapse you should be so

773
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,160
lapse allows you to manage local

774
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,110
administrator passwords so rather than

775
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,600
using the same local admin password on

776
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,979
every machine that guess why a motet is

777
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,840
going to steal and use to spread

778
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,640
throughout your environment you have a

779
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,840
different password on every machine that

780
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,430
stops commodity malware from spreading

781
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,590
two-factor authentication continues to

782
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:17,230
be the single most important control

783
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,970
that we recommend to our customers and a

784
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,740
large amount of post intrusion

785
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,620
ransomware attacks come from things like

786
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,540
brute forcing RDP that's exposed to the

787
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,929
internet don't expose RDP to the

788
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,850
Internet use two-factor authentication

789
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:33,310
and of course patching and so we've had

790
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:36,010
a whole spate of vulnerabilities that

791
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:38,740
we've we've had to publish to our

792
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:43,290
customers on and a lot of VPN and

793
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:47,670
vulnerabilities Palo Alto and SharePoint

794
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:50,110
secure something secure I forgotten and

795
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:53,050
pulse pulse Connect secure that's the

796
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:55,149
one all of these are internet exposed

797
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:59,320
vulnerabilities that enable an actor to

798
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,400
get root access in many cases and making

799
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,169
sure that you're effectively

800
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,940
understanding what vulnerabilities are

801
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,710
being revealed and patching against

802
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,720
those in addition to the other things

803
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,460
I've mentioned is absolutely the best

804
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,120
thing that you can do to try and prevent

805
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:15,520
these kinds of attacks so remarkably

806
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,060
almost exactly on time and if you are a

807
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,770
network defender and I wish you luck

808
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:23,200
secure works we have a big presence here

809
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:25,060
in Romania we have over 700 staff here

810
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,770
and we are always looking to hire new

811
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,600
staff we have a stands next door so

812
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,180
please do come and speak to us if you

813
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,610
want to learn more but all of that happy

814
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:36,480
to take any questions if anybody has any

815
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:40,719
thank you so much Chris

816
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,309
[Applause]

817
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,929
we're going to take three questions and

818
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:53,210
of course we're gonna start with Luciana

819
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:55,210
because he's always the first to papa hi

820
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:58,220
thank you for the presentation

821
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:01,929
EverQuest recently there's this trend

822
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:04,429
where increasingly ransomware crater

823
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:06,830
pushers are targeting the many services

824
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:10,460
providers or many security services

825
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:12,230
providers how do how well companies deal

826
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,419
with that when they rely on those

827
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,279
companies to actually manage their

828
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:18,499
infrastructure and manage their security

829
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,169
for them when the infection actually

830
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:22,850
could come through that company because

831
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:25,070
that company got compromised and

832
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:39,769
obviously the attackers obtained access

833
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:42,320
to all of their customers and often

834
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:44,749
comes back to the fundamentals again so

835
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,730
I used to do security assessment for

836
00:33:44,749 --> 00:33:48,230
large companies I would often say do you

837
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,419
use two-factor authentication and they

838
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,529
would say yes absolutely and then I

839
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:53,480
would say do you use two-factor

840
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,580
authentication for your report add

841
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,200
letters to log into your systems oh no

842
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,359
we haven't accepted for that so

843
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,039
absolutely it's anybody external to your

844
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,109
organization is logging it use two

845
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,340
factor authentication and many times

846
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:11,119
that will prevent logins but I picture

847
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,440
that doesn't solve every case so I could

848
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,450
give a very long answer about all the

849
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,309
security fundamentals but sadly is the

850
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:20,569
fundamentals it's been amazing

851
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:22,429
maximizing trust so making sure your

852
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:24,079
verified their security and then

853
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:25,760
minimizing exposure so if they do have

854
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:30,109
access to your environment make sure

855
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:33,859
that taxes as controls as possible thank

856
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:35,899
you okay next question we have something

857
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:38,580
there in the back here on the left

858
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:41,159
please keep oh there you go

859
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:46,520
you know thank you very much for the

860
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:52,679
nice presentations have a question

861
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:57,390
related to a machine learning can we

862
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:59,430
learn the machine learning to make the

863
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:04,620
difference between a first positive and

864
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:06,660
a real incident the question we're

865
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:09,630
having lots of discussions about that so

866
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,180
we have today we have used machine

867
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,700
learning to make our saw catalysts more

868
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:17,790
efficient so our platform

869
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,009
CTP escalates incident to our saw we use

870
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,870
a system that we call 4c which looks the

871
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,450
decisions that our stock analysts make

872
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:26,549
to see if they say it's a true positive

873
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,080
or a false positive and it tries to

874
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,820
learn what their market has false

875
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,460
positives and reduce the amount of those

876
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,770
that they're seeing so absolutely we can

877
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,930
use machine learning to reduce false

878
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:39,450
positives and take that burden away from

879
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:42,180
our saw catalyst use it when she

880
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,129
learning to detect you true positives if

881
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,690
you weren't previously doing it's a much

882
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,760
more difficult thing to do we haven't

883
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,200
found any effective solutions we have a

884
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,760
whole team working on it and they keep

885
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,080
coming to us for advice and we keep

886
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,450
telling them it's a very difficult

887
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,580
problem to solve and the only thing that

888
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,899
they've so far been able to do is come

889
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,299
up with machine learning algorithms to

890
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,460
identify and debate generation

891
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,440
algorithms and which was great at

892
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,520
detecting why Amazon and CloudFlare and

893
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,440
things like that but terrible at

894
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,300
detecting anything malicious so it

895
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,340
wasn't the best so that's a problem that

896
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:15,030
we have and we haven't got any good

897
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:19,920
solutions for that yet ok one last

898
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:22,050
question if not I think people are very

899
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,290
ready for lunch so thank you so much

900
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:27,989
Chris thank you once again

901
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:27,989
[Applause]
