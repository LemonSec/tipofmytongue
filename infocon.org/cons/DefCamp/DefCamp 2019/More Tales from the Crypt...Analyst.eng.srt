1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,490
good morning everyone my first time in

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,770
Romania so I'm very excited to be here

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,040
although it's a little bit weird because

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,960
when I first started working at NSA this

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,819
was a Soviet bloc country technically

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,270
the enemy so it's a little weird for me

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,330
to be here but I've enjoyed my time so

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,009
far and I don't think we have any issues

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,979
that's all behind us this might contact

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,349
information please feel to reach out to

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,019
me I don't know that I relate much to

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,950
what's going on in Romania that I'm

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,129
certainly happy to to chat with people

14
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:41,550
answer questions give career life advice

15
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:43,290
hacking advice whatever my company that

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,760
I work for they let me come out and do

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,410
this kind of stuff so I always like to

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,030
give them a quick acknowledgement I work

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,379
for a company called online business

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,309
systems they're actually based in

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,500
Winnipeg Canada and I'm part of a

22
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,230
consulting practice there that does a

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,460
lot of consulting advisory work which is

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,239
kind of what I've been doing for the

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,090
last gazillion years my background very

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,100
quickly 37 years in the business raise

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:13,650
your hand if you were born 1982 or later

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:16,309
most of you thank you that there's some

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,810
older people in the group a lot of my

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:22,140
analogies and stories might be a little

31
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,729
bit dated so if you want to say okay

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,210
boomer that's fine that's apparently

33
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,560
trending these days I cut my teeth

34
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,158
within the DoD within the government

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,560
primarily at NSA and that's the the crux

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,990
of the talk today this is more Tales

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,890
from the Crypt analyst I gave a talk

38
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,539
earlier a couple years ago that was

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,100
Tales from the Crypt analyst that talked

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,229
about the beginnings of my career at NSA

41
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,970
and then this is the sequel this is the

42
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,460
last war duty which is what we care

43
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,259
about it's the hacking stuff I do want

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,449
to start by apologizing because when I

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,240
first put this presentation together and

46
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,280
I was trying to find cool screenshots

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,339
and images going back to kind of the

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,220
very beginning of penetration testing

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,700
what we called it or red teaming I made

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,699
this discovery

51
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:17,780
so I apologize I tried to do as best as

52
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,310
I could define graphics that were

53
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:25,100
relative to the time but bear with me

54
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,430
I'm also gonna try to as we go through

55
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,680
the talk today flash up some important

56
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,990
dates in history and this is meant to be

57
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,740
audience participation even though it's

58
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:39,770
Friday morning and and we're not all

59
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,200
necessarily wide awake in ourselves and

60
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,930
we enjoy too much partying last night I

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,810
want you two guys to try to interact so

62
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,550
this is sort of a pop quiz starting with

63
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,200
this anybody know the significance of

64
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,670
this stage just raise your hand shout it

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:01,369
out

66
00:02:51,670 --> 00:03:03,200
anyone give up okay so there's going to

67
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,110
be that kind of scattered throughout the

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,540
presentation I've also included in this

69
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,430
talk because in the last year or so it's

70
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,200
become more of a thing within the hacker

71
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,390
community to try to raise awareness

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,519
about mental health because we've had

73
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:22,339
too many family members that have had

74
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,770
significant issues and sometimes taking

75
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,040
taking extreme measures to try to ease

76
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,170
their pain so I tried to put through the

77
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,060
throughout this talk a little reminder

78
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,519
that no matter how passionate you are

79
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,920
about what you do and how passionate you

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,170
are about all the hacking things and the

81
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,750
technology things don't forget to have a

82
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,579
life so I I'm gonna s'matter and bore

83
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,920
you with family pictures throughout the

84
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,650
talk just to remind everyone that you

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,230
know while I was doing all this stuff it

86
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,960
was a day job I also had a life and I

87
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,970
was doing things extracurricular my

88
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,530
motivation simply because of mental

89
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,530
health is things more like this

90
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:11,310
anybody with me alright alright so I was

91
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:13,630
at NSA for 10 years from 1986 to 1996

92
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,660
during that time I was a cryptographer

93
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,700
and I actually in those days NSA had two

94
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,280
sides what will roughly call offense and

95
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,010
defense well most people know NSA four

96
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,369
is the offense collecting communications

97
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,240
traffic from all over the world and

98
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:32,080
figuring out what other people are

99
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,100
saying our enemies are everybody and the

100
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,690
defensive side was protecting us

101
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,850
primarily the military DoD State

102
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,710
Department communications so offense

103
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,960
defense I worked on both sides at

104
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,659
various times and did these various

105
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,349
things as I said my first talk Tales

106
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,270
from the Crypt

107
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,760
kind of talks about my first two tours

108
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,260
of duty in case you haven't seen that

109
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,070
talk I'll just provide a couple of the

110
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,110
highlights to help give context to how I

111
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,840
ended up becoming your part of the red

112
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,000
team at NSA one of the first things I

113
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,590
did at NSA was I was working for at the

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,830
time what was called manual crypto

115
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,869
systems shop paper cipher manual crypto

116
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,020
systems primarily things called one-time

117
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,900
pads one-time pads if used correctly

118
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,599
which is you keep the pad safe which is

119
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,190
the key and you keep both ends of it

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,400
because there's two of them if you keep

121
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,030
them safe the the encrypted message that

122
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,810
you use with a one-time pad is not

123
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,710
computationally breakable it's

124
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,170
unbreakable

125
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,880
so in my opinion everything we've been

126
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,030
doing since is just kind of downhill

127
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,730
we've sold out from perfect cryptography

128
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,200
to because of speed and we want to do

129
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,790
things fast and do things on the

130
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,700
internet we have to come up with all

131
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:48,010
these different you know new algorithms

132
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,750
and new ways to do cryptography but

133
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,950
they're all solvable it might take a

134
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,750
billion years but they're all

135
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,130
computationally solvable so there's

136
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,110
always a chance that the much somebody

137
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,690
might be able to figure out an actual

138
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,520
cryptographic attack and to me that's

139
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:04,690
always been a big compromise but that's

140
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,150
just my opinion one of my first Jobs was

141
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,060
working with one-time pads I had a

142
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,549
customer let's say approach me and say

143
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,860
hey we're using these one-time pads

144
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,530
communicating with people that we are

145
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,230
interested

146
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:21,260
and having them collect information it's

147
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,510
my long way of saying spies and and

148
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,250
while they have to use the one-time pad

149
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,990
that's printed on the little one-inch

150
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,570
pad that they hide in the heel or their

151
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,450
shoe we back in the office that are the

152
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,490
handlers the managers it takes us hours

153
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,099
to do this encryption and decryption by

154
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,740
hand one letter at a time but we've got

155
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,550
this thing on our desk this PC which was

156
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,140
very new and I'm an IBM PC isn't there

157
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,580
some way we could do the algorithm do

158
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,870
the encryption decryption on the

159
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,530
computer and I thought you know that

160
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:55,760
makes sense what I didn't realize was

161
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,979
that NSA at that time was responsible

162
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,110
for all the cryptographic equipment that

163
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:04,760
was used by the US and it was all

164
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:07,310
hardware it was all little black boxes

165
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,440
that got a cat added onto phones and

166
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,140
radios and communication equipment and

167
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,030
and the idea of doing something in

168
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,169
software had never been done before so

169
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,820
to my best of my ability what I did was

170
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,830
simply take a one-time pad and put the

171
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,750
key on a floppy disk instead of on a

172
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,479
paper pad so they were paired up they

173
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,190
matched and and wrote a program I didn't

174
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,870
write it I was a project manager I found

175
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,979
somebody to write a simple program that

176
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,020
would do the encryption in the

177
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:36,469
decryption a page at a time

178
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,060
securely delete the page and move on

179
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:43,820
this had to go through an approval

180
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:45,830
process this had to be approved by sort

181
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,390
of senior level management within what

182
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,609
was the defensive side of the house

183
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,550
which was called intersect at the time

184
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,950
and you know I'm right out of college

185
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,580
young person in my 20s if you can

186
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,380
imagine I can barely remember it but I'm

187
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,169
standing up in front of all these senior

188
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:06,469
managers you know basically that's the

189
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:08,359
board and old guys in suits that were

190
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,190
mostly engineers and mathematicians but

191
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,200
I was able to get this thing passed and

192
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,930
they because I met all their criteria

193
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,460
and I actually had to sort of hack the

194
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,900
rules because they were written for

195
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:24,200
Hardware and I was doing things and

196
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:25,049
software so God had done I'll come back

197
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,150
to that

198
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,340
got it done they said when they approved

199
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,489
me okay we'll let you do this we'll let

200
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,049
you feel that please don't do this again

201
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,029
one of the other things that I did and

202
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,338
you know I had another customer using

203
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:40,919
one-time pads and they used a particular

204
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,599
one-time pad that uses a substitution

205
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,079
table called a Visionnaire square that's

206
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,430
the algorithm it's a three-letter

207
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:49,529
combination if you think row-column and

208
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,120
then find the matching thing and they

209
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,760
would memorize these three letter

210
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,709
combinations I however did not have him

211
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,660
memorize so at some point I came up with

212
00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:00,029
this idea of because I've just been

213
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,370
through crypto 101 classes learning

214
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,689
about cypher wheels I thought there

215
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,850
ought to be a way to make a cipher wheel

216
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,950
out of this this thing that's called a

217
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,140
Visionnaire table so I came up with a

218
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,790
Visionnaire wheel I have the prototype

219
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,500
with me if anybody's interested in

220
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,610
seeing it later been carrying this

221
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,610
around for a long time

222
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,540
earlier this year somebody approached me

223
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,220
and said have you ever heard of a Diana

224
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,410
cryptosystem the special force is used

225
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,630
and I looka gooba bit and I saw this

226
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,459
picture I'm like well sure looks a lot

227
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,310
like my wheel that we didn't call it the

228
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:33,810
Diana cryptosystem long story short I

229
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,489
got in touch with the guy that's an

230
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,560
artist that makes these things out of

231
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:41,339
wood and he sent me one of them you can

232
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,439
see that to later find me out but he was

233
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,570
approached by somebody that was an

234
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,910
instructor one of the war colleges that

235
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,829
was ex-special forces that wanted to

236
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,110
preserve the history because we ended up

237
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:54,359
making like 15,000 of these wheels and

238
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,610
just distributing it out to the US

239
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,850
Special Forces and as far as I can tell

240
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,410
they used them for about 10 years this

241
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,329
is all stuff I did like the first two

242
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,980
years that I was in NSA he sent me a

243
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:07,500
whole package of things he has lots of

244
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,820
wooden crypto puzzles the thing in the

245
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,310
middle is supposed to be the Enigma

246
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,660
machine the three rotor version and I

247
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,750
think the one on the bottoms like the

248
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,060
Mexican Army cipher wheel and I actually

249
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,100
found a picture online of that's and

250
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,369
that's an actual copy of the production

251
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,779
model I'm I'm on a hunt for somebody

252
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,339
finding one of these things because I'd

253
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:29,459
love to have an actual production one

254
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,589
all I have is the prototype anyway I was

255
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:35,399
doing all this stuff and I got cash

256
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:37,060
awards this is my old boss handing me an

257
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,340
award for one of these

258
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,109
and he referred to me as a loose cannon

259
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,120
I don't think that he was being

260
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,740
complimentary when he said that but I

261
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,510
kind of took that as a badge of honor

262
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,160
because I figured out how to get stuff

263
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,069
done I thought that's the right thing to

264
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,410
do I'm satisfying my customer I'm giving

265
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:57,040
them what they need so that's the first

266
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,990
chapter ii chapter i moved on and became

267
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,240
what was known as an intern of krypton a

268
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,730
script analysis intern and so I was

269
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,010
doing six months tours in different

270
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,810
offices primarily over on the offensive

271
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,610
side and I happened to be over there

272
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,829
during the first skirmish in the desert

273
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,320
which we call Desert Shield Desert Storm

274
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,750
so I got you know commendation for that

275
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,060
everybody at NSA did that's what NSA

276
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:23,490
looks like by the way at least a part of

277
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:25,599
it and this is more for your benefit

278
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,640
there was an article it came out a

279
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,100
couple years ago in Wired magazine that

280
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,480
talked about well before this article

281
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,520
came out there's an article came out

282
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,900
that said some CIA analysts you know

283
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,050
during his lunch break over years and

284
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:41,050
years had finally cracked the code of

285
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,209
this statue that's in the courtyard of

286
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,040
the CIA headquarters and that's a

287
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,280
picture of the statue there the statute

288
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,770
was called Kryptos and so this article

289
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,110
came out afterwards and said oh but NSA

290
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,670
solved it years before this guy from CIA

291
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,880
and it had to do with a bunch of

292
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,579
cryptanalysis interns so I just wanted

293
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,820
to say I was one of those interns that's

294
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,440
an actual copy of the computer printout

295
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,120
of the cipher that we copied off the

296
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,160
statute you can notice the timestamp

297
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,820
Jason and that's why I know what the CIA

298
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:17,020
lobby looks like and I was certified as

299
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:18,970
a crypt analysis intern my final six

300
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,550
month tours an intern was back on the

301
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,500
InfoSec side of the house and I went to

302
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,380
work for an organization called fielded

303
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:31,870
systems evaluations and the purpose of

304
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:33,700
this organization was to somebody had

305
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,400
the great idea that the way that NSA

306
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:39,120
very often would intercept and read and

307
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,100
solve the communications problems of our

308
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,570
people that we were listening to was we

309
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,850
would take advantage of the fact that

310
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,700
those people using those systems very

311
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,769
often misused them like they would take

312
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,540
a one-time key and use it for a

313
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,470
month when you do that you're

314
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,540
introducing cryptographic

315
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,529
vulnerabilities that make the problem

316
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,540
solvable they would find bypasses and

317
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,129
the machines they wouldn't do the

318
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,230
switches in the right order they were

319
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:08,319
basically not using him correctly and

320
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,899
somebody thought well NSA produces the

321
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:13,748
best crypto in the world we design it in

322
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:16,420
our labs and we test it and it's and

323
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:18,009
it's rated for whatever classification

324
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,079
it needs but how do we know that our

325
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:22,449
people are using it correctly in the

326
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,479
field so this office was set up to do

327
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:26,679
fielded systems evaluations and shortly

328
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,230
after I went to work in that

329
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:31,540
organization actually this is one of the

330
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,489
the devices that I was evaluating this

331
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,860
was a like I said it's a little black

332
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:38,160
box that does the crypto and it would

333
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,529
take a phone signal which was the analog

334
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,860
digitize it encrypt it convert it back

335
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:46,449
to analog and send it out and then one

336
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,040
on the other end would reverse it and

337
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:50,258
you could you could hear what the person

338
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,689
was saying although they kind of sounded

339
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:53,799
like Donald Duck

340
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:54,849
but here's one of those days shortly

341
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,579
after I went to work for that

342
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:01,769
organization this happened anybody know

343
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:04,029
what's special about this date I'm sorry

344
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:06,730
that's closed that was a few years

345
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:09,429
earlier actually I worked with dr. more

346
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:13,449
senior that's another story for another

347
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:15,429
day this is the day that our world

348
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:17,139
changed this is the day Y we're all

349
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:19,809
sitting here doing all this technology

350
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:22,629
internet cybersecurity stuff these days

351
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:24,819
it's the day that the first commercially

352
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:27,389
available free browser was released to

353
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:31,949
the public anybody remember this browser

354
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:31,949
the few people that are as old as I am

355
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:37,929
other things happen shortly thereafter

356
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:41,258
like cool Hollywood movies came out and

357
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:43,059
so those of us in the office that were

358
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,759
devoted to what at the time was called

359
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:47,850
networked systems we started looking

360
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,679
into this thing called computer hacking

361
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:55,209
our reference materials back in those

362
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:56,889
days were books like DS my orientation

363
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:58,959
the book on the left

364
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,999
this was our Bible because back in those

365
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,799
days all the workstations and all the

366
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,760
networks from basically UNIX systems

367
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:08,050
this was the prior

368
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,270
windows and too no security meant you

369
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,550
had to know how to secure units and the

370
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:15,790
networks were all written everything was

371
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,859
Unix the book on the right was one of

372
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,599
the early books written about some guys

373
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,310
that were college professors that

374
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,020
tracked down hackers that were breaking

375
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,660
into the university mainframes where

376
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:29,260
they worked oh here's one of those

377
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,569
family shots shortly before I went to

378
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,930
work in this last office I got married

379
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:39,340
started having kids and so I'm a dad I

380
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:40,719
was a dad back then early on that's one

381
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,710
of those mental health hacker things

382
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,120
reminders so this small group of us in

383
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,710
this office that we're interested in

384
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,360
networking systems we were trying to

385
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,640
learn everything about being hackers

386
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,390
computer security network security UNIX

387
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,939
security and one of the things that one

388
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:00,460
of our motivations was a book that was

389
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,960
written called the Cuckoo's egg anybody

390
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,030
familiar with this book heard this book

391
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,160
rather this book if you haven't you know

392
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:09,250
I will cite several sources here that

393
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,400
are recommended reading if for no other

394
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,170
reason than historical purposes so the

395
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,180
Cuckoo's egg is a book about again this

396
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,969
guy that looks like a college professor

397
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:22,540
I think he's an astronomer and back in

398
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,790
those days to do work on the computer at

399
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,610
the University which was a mainframe you

400
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:29,469
had to pay for your time and he

401
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,530
basically was looking at his monthly

402
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,990
bill one month and noticed a discrepancy

403
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,790
in the billing and he started

404
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,550
investigating it and one thing led to

405
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,620
another and he figured out that you know

406
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:45,550
hackers from East Germany had broken

407
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,470
into the his university's computer which

408
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,719
was connected in those days to other

409
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,780
university computers which were mostly

410
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,110
doing government military DoD type of

411
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,819
research and work and he was able he was

412
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,530
like the first forensics guy he had to

413
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:03,070
figure out how to track him down and

414
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:04,030
nobody had ever done it before so he you

415
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,620
know this book was one of the

416
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,959
inspirations for all of us trying to

417
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:09,550
learn this hacker culture I actually had

418
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,410
the privilege of meeting cliff Stoll

419
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:15,010
earlier this year at another conference

420
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:17,680
so I got my picture taken with them if

421
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,210
you've ever seen there's there's a

422
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,000
a movie about him that they did about

423
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:25,210
the Cuckoo's egg on a show called Nova

424
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,950
which is like a science show if you ever

425
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,940
get a chance to see it you can find it

426
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,520
on YouTube

427
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,380
he's as quirky in real life as he is in

428
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,110
the show he actually plays himself in

429
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,670
the movie but a genuinely great guy one

430
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,469
of my heroes and one of my early

431
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,940
inspirations and I had a chance to meet

432
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:46,200
him this year so anyway when the

433
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,780
government gets an idea they like to do

434
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,550
this thing called reorganization so you

435
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,500
know the internet was becoming a thing

436
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,270
the browsers were out there so the

437
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,640
senior level management decided to

438
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,379
reorganize and create a center of

439
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,630
excellence that they called the systems

440
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:05,830
and network attack center or snack for

441
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,870
short and so the the the office that I

442
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,419
was in got reorganized into this new

443
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,070
center of excellence and we actually

444
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,960
went to work for an organization called

445
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,169
c4 which we thought was kind of cool

446
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,030
because you know it's an explosive and

447
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,820
the idea of the whole organization was

448
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:23,950
primarily to be a research organization

449
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,080
to study all things in terms of

450
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,990
operating systems and network protocols

451
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,159
and figure out the best way to do

452
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,140
everything so we could write

453
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,640
recommendations and then there was a

454
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,290
small group that I was working with

455
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,730
where we just wanted to break things we

456
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,620
just wanted to break into things and

457
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,040
figure out how to how to find

458
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:44,850
vulnerabilities and and to use some of

459
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,440
the modern vernacular to poke the poem

460
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,240
but we just called it routing back then

461
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,070
because in those days the object was to

462
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,070
get route on the box and then you

463
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:58,090
controlled everything so we put together

464
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,740
a team we sort of organized and you know

465
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,270
we sort of had the blessing of senior

466
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,370
level management because he had this

467
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,810
idea that you know as he says here

468
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,909
that's more or less than an exact quote

469
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,629
just get a bunch of those hacker guys

470
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,730
together

471
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,130
and you know we'll be the best in the

472
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,610
world well there was only about six or

473
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:18,550
eight of us but we sort of took on the

474
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,740
charge and one of the things that we did

475
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:24,820
to try to learn was we took a visit to

476
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,740
this organization called the after read

477
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,409
it the air force information warfare

478
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,600
Center back in those days the air force

479
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,550
was responsible for the network for the

480
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,530
military so they had the first Network

481
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,570
Operations Center and then they were the

482
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,520
first ones to establish a Security

483
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,379
Operations Center and that got

484
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,270
reorganized into this thing called the

485
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,670
air force information warfare Center so

486
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,410
we went down to learn we went down to to

487
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:51,290
see it all in action to see what they

488
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,770
were doing our hosts were these two

489
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:57,409
gentlemen we just called the captain's

490
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:59,570
gentleman on the left captain Waddell he

491
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,700
actually passed I'm sorry that's captain

492
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,919
zeiss he passed away about two years ago

493
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,780
unfortunately but he's been in he was in

494
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,970
the industry and did a lot of great

495
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,379
things gentleman on the right captain

496
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,820
Waddell I actually got in touch with

497
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,760
when I was putting this talk together

498
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,169
you know we hadn't talked in 20 25 years

499
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,780
but we had a good like hour-and-a-half

500
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,490
chat just kind of you know catching up

501
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,950
and you know sort of comparing our

502
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,350
careers and where our paths are crossed

503
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,820
and who we knew and things like that but

504
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,699
these were the guys that were setting up

505
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,899
the original security operations center

506
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,080
kind of the first one that was done

507
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:35,540
within the DoD they actually went on to

508
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,399
form one of the first commercial

509
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,950
companies in this the whole security

510
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,320
realm a company called Wheel group they

511
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,600
lasted all of about 11 months before

512
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,679
they got acquired by a larger company

513
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,629
called Cisco probably one of the first

514
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,310
Cisco acquisitions and security

515
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,140
companies and I like to rat anybody work

516
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,760
here from Cisco I apologize I like to

517
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,160
razz on Cisco because they still have

518
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,260
this identity crisis of trying to be

519
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,230
known as a security company but nobody

520
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:06,680
thinks of him as a security company

521
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:11,240
so this Center was in San Antonio so we

522
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:13,190
took a field trip to San Antonio and one

523
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,900
of the cool things we did was they this

524
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,670
was on an Air Force Base and they sort

525
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,210
of had an Air Force Museum and we got to

526
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:23,960
see one of these recently at the time

527
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:25,940
Declassified spy planes the sr-71 we had

528
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,340
just done Desert Storm there's the HM

529
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,110
warthog we got to see one of those up

530
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,659
close and personal and that kind of

531
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,909
helped us win Desert Storm those are

532
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,770
actually some of the original members of

533
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,890
the red team there and it's small enough

534
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:42,110
hopefully that they're not identifiable

535
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,370
we got a chance to sightsee we visited

536
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,469
the Alamo

537
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,270
and there's this thing in San Antonio

538
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,790
called the Riverwalk because there's a

539
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,860
river runs through the city and very

540
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:56,270
important in hacker culture we

541
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,679
discovered the 46 ounce margarita and I

542
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:01,970
recommend you only have one an evening

543
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:04,220
and that was more than enough I was

544
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,860
actually in San Antonio and we had gone

545
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,500
out to a steak place and had like a 26

546
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,649
ounce steak followed by these 46 ounce

547
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,540
margaritas and later on I back at the

548
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,430
hotel I called my wife to check on how

549
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,170
the family is doing and I was telling

550
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,000
her about oh we had this great huge

551
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,310
steak and we had this great big drink

552
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,750
and it was all sorts of fun and how's

553
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,200
that you and the family and she's like

554
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,570
yeah the four kids and I we we shared a

555
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,940
can of tuna for dinner tonight because I

556
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,470
was too tired to cook I'm like okay so I

557
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,110
made sure when I got home I took my

558
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:40,880
family on vacations again mental health

559
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:44,629
hackers work-life balance the biggest

560
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,910
takeaway from our trip to Africa was not

561
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,740
that they had a lot to teach us because

562
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,150
they they were doing a lot of the things

563
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,270
that we already knew about we're already

564
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,430
doing but they had an office structure

565
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,230
that we thought was kind of cool back in

566
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,050
those days everybody have little

567
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,640
cubicles and a big open room would be

568
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,350
filled up with you know however many

569
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,690
cubicles it could hold and everybody had

570
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,429
like a little 6 foot by 8 foot space

571
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,500
with walls around and you're all

572
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,480
isolated they had pushed all the

573
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,700
cubicles to the corners and the edges of

574
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,050
the room and put a round table that was

575
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,360
the best thing I could come up with like

576
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,730
I said I apologize for the graphics but

577
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,979
they had this concept where everybody

578
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,600
would be doing their work but if anybody

579
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,250
had a problem where they wanted to ask

580
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,409
questions or if they wanted to pull

581
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,090
everybody together they would call round

582
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,560
table and everybody would spin their

583
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,620
chairs come to the center of the room

584
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,639
which where there was a literal literal

585
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,500
roundtable and they would have their

586
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,480
little meeting and chat session and try

587
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,580
to figure stuff out so we adopted that

588
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,680
that was something that we did in the

589
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,379
center of our Roundtable one of us had

590
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,140
brought home one of those 46 ounce

591
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,480
margarita glasses that we nicknamed the

592
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,790
orb and I think one of us still has it

593
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,260
I'm not sure which one of those and we

594
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,928
filled it up with like rubber balls

595
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,730
bouncy balls and everyone snow

596
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:59,679
while you know to just to blow off steam

597
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,379
we'd have like rubber ball battles in

598
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,700
our office and and try not yeah we just

599
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:05,529
throw them and just see where they went

600
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,179
and stuff like that because we were

601
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:08,919
trying to live the hacker culture and we

602
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,470
were trying to be different we obviously

603
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,389
needed our own space and this is this

604
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,519
office that we were in after we were

605
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:18,939
reorganized into this thing called the

606
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:23,110
snack was moved up to and this is a

607
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,070
photo of an area just west of an airport

608
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,779
in the States

609
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,178
that's called Baltimore Baltimore

610
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:30,309
Washington International Airport so it's

611
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:32,919
one of the airports that services

612
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:35,200
Washington DC the nation's capital and

613
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,899
just west of the airport is this office

614
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,970
complex that it's not really a secret

615
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:42,189
that it's a lot of NSA buildings and in

616
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,470
this building in this corner is where we

617
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,149
set up our office I tell you this

618
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,159
because a couple years ago a book came

619
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:51,489
out called dark territory and by here

620
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,610
this book the secret history of the pipe

621
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,499
the cyber war in this book chapter four

622
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,830
is called eligible receiver we'll get

623
00:24:56,499 --> 00:25:02,139
back to that later and in that chapter

624
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:05,918
there's this paragraph I would like to

625
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:08,199
read to you just a portion of somewhere

626
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,200
in the middle there during its most

627
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,470
sensitive drills the red team worked out

628
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,899
of a chamber called the pit which was so

629
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:20,080
secret that few people at NSA knew it

630
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:22,229
existed and even they couldn't enter

631
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,029
without first passing through to

632
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,119
combination locked doors

633
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:30,249
well the pit was actually this group of

634
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:32,470
six guys that were in an office I was

635
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:34,509
one of them and we had nicknamed our

636
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,429
office the pit again trying to sort of

637
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:39,940
live the hacker culture and be different

638
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:41,919
and and be cool and kind of nerdy and so

639
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,899
we had nicknamed our office and we were

640
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,999
very excited when this book came out one

641
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:47,799
of us got the book and took a picture of

642
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:49,629
that paragraph and centered around all

643
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:51,610
this guys were famous we're famous we're

644
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:53,949
in a book I have no idea how the

645
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,320
folklore lived on but apparently the

646
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,720
thing that we did that we called the pit

647
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,490
became a thing and ended up in a book

648
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,490
which is why I'm up here talking today

649
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,330
so we were trying to become pen testers

650
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,159
we were trying to we didn't call it red

651
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,049
teaming at the time and we were trying

652
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,309
to learn how to break into things and we

653
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:13,440
realized we had to come up with a

654
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:15,990
methodology there were no sans courses

655
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,030
there were no certifications back then

656
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,410
we were kind of winging it we were

657
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,120
trying to figure out and there's a

658
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:24,120
there's a way that you do this that I

659
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,469
think is is you know logical and make

660
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,169
sense and I don't think it's largely

661
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,820
changed this day so somebody had to

662
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:33,900
write it down and since somebody had to

663
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:37,590
figure out what it was we did have some

664
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,600
interesting ground rules though and I'll

665
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:43,230
go into more detail on some of that but

666
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,309
basically a we had managers that didn't

667
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,990
understand what we did and so they were

668
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:51,389
reticent to let us do our thing and

669
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:54,360
there was a lot of misunderstanding and

670
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,520
sort of an aura of mystery about all

671
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,719
these these guys in this mysterious

672
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,370
office doing these mysterious things and

673
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,410
whether you believe it or not NSA as a

674
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,629
large government organization is

675
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,520
actually rather conservative in what it

676
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,559
does and so they don't like to do things

677
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,990
new and different and move fast and

678
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,820
quickly and there was also this thing

679
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,080
called the NSA Charter which I'll go

680
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,230
into a little bit more later

681
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,590
that basically prescribed sort of the

682
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,850
ground rules of how NSA operated which

683
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,490
has come into question in the last

684
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,918
couple years with the Patriot Act and

685
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:32,280
Edward Snowden and all that another

686
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,710
story for another day but you know

687
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,889
basically NSA is supposed to do what NSA

688
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:40,020
does to foreign nationals and NSA is not

689
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,910
allowed to do what NSA does to u.s.

690
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,730
citizens that's the Charter that we

691
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,740
learned and that was sort of problematic

692
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,140
because we were trying to do the ethical

693
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,179
hacking the white hat be the good guys

694
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,830
and break-in first and explain how it

695
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:57,150
was done so they can close their holes

696
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:59,370
up and be more secure so as I said we

697
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,750
came up with an assessment methodology

698
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,120
we actually called it a vulnerability

699
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,429
and a threat assessment and basically

700
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,168
you figure out what you're gonna target

701
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:09,540
we did what we called recon I mean we

702
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:12,150
worked for our military organization our

703
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:15,570
customers were mostly the military so we

704
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,440
kind of used the military jargon so we'd

705
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,450
figure out

706
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,480
what our targets were and then we would

707
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,070
do some sort of initial discovery you

708
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,410
know what do we have to work with

709
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,760
Network probes port scanning and things

710
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,460
like that figure out what they were

711
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,260
talking what what what communications

712
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,870
protocols they were using that we might

713
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,030
be able to use to leverage and then we

714
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,590
would develop and plan okay this is how

715
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,930
we're going to attack it we'd break in

716
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:44,280
we'd win we'd write up a report we were

717
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:46,140
done so that was the methodology to try

718
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,910
to put this in perspective and this is

719
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,350
certainly not an exhaustive list these

720
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:57,800
are the kind of things that we didn't

721
00:28:49,350 --> 00:29:02,879
have back then exactly somebody gets it

722
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:05,310
you're my people another interruption

723
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,750
for mental health hackers I was always

724
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,540
home for the holidays one of the

725
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,670
advantages of being a hacker at NSA was

726
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,590
it was literally a nine-to-five job

727
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:17,130
Monday through Friday you couldn't take

728
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:19,889
your work home with you so I wasn't

729
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:23,850
terribly disciplined I was forced into

730
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:27,180
having time off and not doing my job so

731
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,889
I showed you what we didn't have let me

732
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:32,990
talk a little bit about what we did have

733
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:34,500
okay and because we didn't have anything

734
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:39,650
you get it

735
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:42,150
you feel me so here's a small disclaimer

736
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,460
one of the rules that we had to operate

737
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:48,060
under was any time that we were doing

738
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,730
what we did to a target which was

739
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:53,310
ordinarily a computer or network that

740
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:56,010
was classified everything that we did

741
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:58,530
had to be classified at the level of our

742
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:01,200
target so if we were going after a top

743
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,629
secret network or a top secret computer

744
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,960
or mainframe everything we did was

745
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,520
classified top secret so I'm not going

746
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,340
to show you the things that we were

747
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,440
using nudge-nudge wink-wink I'm gonna

748
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,149
show you things that were available at

749
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,009
the time you with me

750
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:21,320
that's my disclaimer so we have these

751
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:24,019
things called Network sniffers you have

752
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,700
like what Wireshark software today back

753
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:27,529
in those days the network sniffer is

754
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,570
weighed about 4050 pounds there were

755
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:31,129
these big huge boxes they were on parts

756
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,799
you'd wheel him around to wherever the

757
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,998
network closet was where the routers and

758
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,429
switches were and you had to like

759
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:41,659
physically plug them in to do the

760
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:43,419
network traffic we had we did have

761
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:45,859
available to us one of the first

762
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:48,139
freeware vulnerability scanners of a

763
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:52,879
school a tool called Satan's anybody

764
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:55,959
ever used Satan this is a stroll down

765
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:59,090
memory lane for some of those old timers

766
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,940
also sort of you know meeting my heroes

767
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:05,209
in the last year so the guys that roads

768
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,590
Satan Viets of enema and dan farmer it

769
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,019
took us about eight months but we

770
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:11,509
actually scheduled them to be on our

771
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:14,119
show I'm on a webcast podcast by the way

772
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:16,429
and we got to interview these guys just

773
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:18,609
about a year ago a very special moment

774
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:22,700
for me because I had met Dan farmer

775
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:24,710
20-some odd years ago and he made yeah

776
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,179
he wrote this tool called Satan there

777
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,879
was this other guy named Chris Klaus

778
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:30,950
that wrote a tool called ISS damned

779
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:32,599
farmer and the and beats ax they put it

780
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,340
out there for everybody to use for free

781
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,249
because they wanted everybody to be more

782
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,509
secure this other guy that wrote ISS

783
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:40,879
turned it into a company that

784
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:42,529
closed-source it and you know the guy

785
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:44,689
became a multi-million slash a

786
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:47,749
billionaire I think know where he is

787
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:51,559
today but these guys did these guys were

788
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:53,659
sort of in it for the love of the craft

789
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,549
and they wanted to make things honestly

790
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:58,009
better so that was a special moment for

791
00:31:55,549 --> 00:32:00,168
me to get to interview him if you get a

792
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:03,729
chance go listen to that episode it's

793
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:12,349
Paul's security weekly episode 584

794
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:14,419
another date anyone yes my birthday this

795
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:18,109
thing called bug track came out anybody

796
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:20,929
ever hear a bug track bug track if you

797
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:24,830
haven't heard of it oh and I also used

798
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:27,889
to take the kids to the pool that was a

799
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:29,418
long time ago bug track was one of the

800
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:31,549
primary methods for

801
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:33,259
people that were security professionals

802
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,639
hackers whatever you wanted to call us

803
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:36,079
back in the day of finding out

804
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:39,349
vulnerability information

805
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:41,869
it was a communications channel that was

806
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:44,509
done over email and it was an email

807
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:46,488
archive so if you posted a question like

808
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:48,259
I'm trying to configure this firewall

809
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:50,239
and I don't know how to do it people

810
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:51,739
would respond to what are you trying to

811
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:53,239
do and they would answer the question

812
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:55,999
this is what I'm trying to do oh you

813
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:58,759
need to do this and it was it was

814
00:32:55,999 --> 00:33:02,479
primarily designed to you know help

815
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:03,829
people solve problems fix bugs and but

816
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:06,619
it was also a great resource for

817
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:10,668
information just in general one of our

818
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:13,070
primary sources there was this there's

819
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:14,869
organizations like cert computer

820
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,639
emergency response team that would put

821
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:19,279
out advisories of hacker activity

822
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:20,748
because it was infrequent enough back in

823
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,909
those days that they had the time to

824
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:24,679
like write up reports of we're seeing

825
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:26,749
stuff going on and you should know about

826
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,749
I don't know if you can read any of that

827
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:31,759
stuff over here this is an actual

828
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:35,829
certain visor II that was issued on July

829
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:38,809
4th 1996 and it's talking about the the

830
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:41,359
malware that we would call today that

831
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:43,789
can penetrate evil aliens operating

832
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,708
system if you've ever seen this movie

833
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:49,820
Independence Day that's sort of how we

834
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:53,179
won the battle we hacked the the

835
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:55,729
mothership so they had time to have a

836
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:57,229
sense of humor back in those days we did

837
00:33:55,729 --> 00:34:00,409
things called open source collection

838
00:33:57,229 --> 00:34:03,289
what we call Osten fuse days we had FA

839
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:06,759
queues that we could look up we had very

840
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:09,168
rudimentary database query searches

841
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:10,940
because most of the information back in

842
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:12,768
that back in those days was just stored

843
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,079
on mainframes that were all connected

844
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:17,209
and that was where all the data was so

845
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:20,059
they had all these different things also

846
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:22,069
back in those days every device on the

847
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:24,200
network had an internet routable IP

848
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:26,089
address and and it had to be registered

849
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,819
and had to be part of a domain there

850
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:30,889
wasn't private addresses going on back

851
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:33,500
then so if you had a target you could

852
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:36,919
look up who owned it what was the domain

853
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:40,279
on things like the internet another

854
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:42,980
search engine we were talking about how

855
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:43,639
there was no Google when we started out

856
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,739
we had this

857
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,440
kick-ass search tool called AltaVista

858
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:50,659
remember AltaVista way better than

859
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,399
Google and of course it's not here

860
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:55,519
anymore

861
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,368
the browser's evolved so mosaic turned

862
00:34:55,518 --> 00:35:01,339
into Netscape Navigator the original

863
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:03,589
Yahoo when that first came out one of

864
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:05,420
the fun things about the original Yahoo

865
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:07,339
website was they had this sort of

866
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,200
roulette button where you could just

867
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:10,999
click on it and it would take you to a

868
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,828
random website because back in those

869
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:14,509
days they just wanted two people to

870
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:16,400
start being on the Internet and using it

871
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:17,450
and find out what was out there so you

872
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,440
could just go out there and play

873
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,439
Internet roulette

874
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:26,180
we would do things to find targets as I

875
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,130
said acquisition and if you notice we

876
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,519
didn't have end map before end map we

877
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,170
had this tool called stroke trivia

878
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:40,819
question does anybody know who wrote

879
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:42,619
strobe any idea julian assange when I

880
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:44,509
was doing this talk and I was looking up

881
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,460
when did all the tools come out and so I

882
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,529
looked up strobe and I saw who wrote it

883
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,509
julian assange like that's why I knew

884
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,950
the guy his name because you know he's

885
00:35:50,509 --> 00:35:55,430
been in the news the last couple years

886
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:57,259
and I knew I knew him but I didn't know

887
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,259
why and when I saw strobe because when

888
00:35:57,259 --> 00:36:02,359
you would launch strobe again it was a

889
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:04,519
shelled program it would scroll up and

890
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:06,470
say this is strobe you know version

891
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:08,328
whatever written by Julie on the side so

892
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:12,410
every time you ran strobe you saw the

893
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:13,789
guy's name so there was there was other

894
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,118
tools where you could do the domain

895
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:18,920
lookups and try to find your targets

896
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,200
nslookup was another way of identifying

897
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,180
the names of the IP addresses so some of

898
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,160
the attacks that we would do would

899
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,109
involve the names rather than IP

900
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,239
addresses or if we wanted to verify

901
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:31,489
ownership and make sure we weren't going

902
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:34,880
out of bounds of what we were looking at

903
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:37,369
and we even had Network mapping back in

904
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,680
those days very rudimentary but from a

905
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:43,220
military perspective back in those days

906
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,890
where there was mainframes there was

907
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:48,470
servers that have typically had the

908
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,839
information that you wanted to go after

909
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:53,058
you could do some sort of sort of

910
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:55,430
traffic analysis mapping all the IP

911
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:56,760
addresses and finding out you know who's

912
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,680
all talking to what

913
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:04,530
because that tended to be the target he

914
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:06,509
wanted to go after another date the

915
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:11,030
public release of crack and by hear of

916
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:13,410
crack it's a tool not of other thing

917
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,600
crap was one of the first password

918
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,129
cracking tools became very popular and

919
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,960
again it was it was written to try to

920
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,850
improve the security it was written for

921
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,100
admins to say let's look at all your

922
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,839
password files of all your users and

923
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,940
make sure they're using good passwords

924
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,520
of course we've solved the password

925
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,580
problem so this is ancient history but

926
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,430
back in those days the passwords were

927
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,770
hashed and the hashes of the files were

928
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,529
kept in a file called Etsy password and

929
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,570
it was world readable so anybody on the

930
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:45,090
network anybody on any of the systems

931
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:48,000
could look at that file and see all the

932
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:50,100
hashes for all the accounts and this is

933
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,680
an actual copy of a file not from my

934
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,360
government days shortly thereafter but

935
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,100
that's what the password files used to

936
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,010
look like and so those are actual

937
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,690
hatches take a picture of it type it in

938
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,600
run crack you'll probably get some

939
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,300
passwords out of them but that was one

940
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,990
of the primary methods then of getting

941
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,990
into systems was guessing passwords in

942
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,500
those days it was new to put people onto

943
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,479
the network

944
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,910
and not everybody wanted to even be on

945
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:20,340
the computer or use the network so very

946
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:22,170
often there'd be lots of accounts on the

947
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,390
system that they'd set up with an

948
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,430
initial password like you know password

949
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:28,799
or not even have a password at all and

950
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,879
the accounts had never been asked access

951
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,070
because the people didn't want to use

952
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,730
them people older than me they're like

953
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:38,730
new computers one of the other ways that

954
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,830
we broke in to systems very commonly in

955
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:44,460
those days was taking advantage of what

956
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:46,290
was called set UID set UID is a UNIX

957
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,270
feature that basically takes the

958
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:51,300
ownership of the program and the

959
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,850
programs in UNIX typically run in the

960
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,770
profile of whoever wrote the program or

961
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:58,170
the owns the program which very often

962
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:01,230
was route and if you could find one of

963
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:03,720
these programs that were written to run

964
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:06,480
as if they were route and if you could

965
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,149
cause them to hiccup or break or halt

966
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,250
their process very often they would dump

967
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,870
you out into the

968
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,790
she´ll that still had the

969
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:16,250
characteristics of the ownership when it

970
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,870
was running which was rude so a way to

971
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,330
get a root shell was to find one of

972
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,250
these set UID programs and figure out a

973
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:26,720
way to get it to break which was not

974
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:28,580
terribly hard in those days so that's

975
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,629
some of the tradecraft and some some of

976
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:34,580
the way that we did this back in the day

977
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:36,890
we went through some growing pains and

978
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:40,430
again this is where the NSA charter

979
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:42,259
comes into play and we were working it

980
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:48,129
for a very conservative organization

981
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:54,980
that wanted to move slowly another date

982
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:57,530
anybody ever hear of PGP PGP for a

983
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,300
little bit of history was a publicly

984
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:02,000
available encryption program that came

985
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,940
out as you can see in 1991 the gentleman

986
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,560
who wrote it Phil Zimmermann got into a

987
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,840
lot of trouble because back in those

988
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,060
days any cryptographic product was

989
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:14,270
labeled or considered to be munitions

990
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,980
and it had to be handled such and men it

991
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:18,350
couldn't be exported outside of the

992
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,780
United States and so there was a lot of

993
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:22,670
politicians trying to figure in people

994
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,800
within the DoD trying to figure out what

995
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,390
to do with PGP because NSA used to

996
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,100
provide all the crypto and now

997
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,589
somebody's going and writing free crypto

998
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,940
and just giving it away to anybody again

999
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:35,480
it's a problem we've solved we don't

1000
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,460
have issues with that anymore but I'll

1001
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,340
tell a quick little story about PGP

1002
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:43,010
there was a day when in our in our

1003
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:45,530
systems and network attack center an

1004
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:47,780
edict went out because one of our

1005
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,400
customers that was getting ready to

1006
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,860
spend millions and millions of dollars

1007
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,170
on new cryptographic equipment that NSA

1008
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:56,090
was designing and building they had come

1009
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,890
back to NSA and said why do we need to

1010
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:01,190
spend all this money couldn't we just

1011
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:04,810
use PGP so this edict went out to say

1012
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:07,700
we've got to find an attack against PGP

1013
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:09,290
and this is actually me getting to meet

1014
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,910
Phil Zimmermann about a year ago I've

1015
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:15,259
met all my heroes in the last year it's

1016
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:16,609
really cool but there are some guys to

1017
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,730
take you so you don't have to stare at

1018
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:24,190
me twice there are some guys in an

1019
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,190
office it was sort of next to us that

1020
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:30,558
figured out an attack against PGP and

1021
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,538
they got all sorts of cash awards and

1022
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,539
they were hailed as heroes and they were

1023
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:37,670
taken down to the Pentagon and various

1024
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:40,670
other places in DC and all of the

1025
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:43,009
military facilities and they were giving

1026
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,559
talks about you know how they'd come up

1027
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:47,420
with an attack against PGP and saved the

1028
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:51,589
day so the NSA could continue in the

1029
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:53,960
business of producing crypto hailed as

1030
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:56,390
heroes months later when sort of the

1031
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,000
dust settled down they gave a brown-bag

1032
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:01,460
lunch talk about what they had done and

1033
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,890
I had never heard the details so I went

1034
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:07,460
to it so what they did essentially was

1035
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:10,009
this see if this sounds familiar they

1036
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,019
found in a word we caught it word

1037
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:14,000
processing back in those days you know

1038
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:16,250
things like Microsoft Word I think back

1039
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,069
then it was word star they found some

1040
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,990
unused byte space in a document and they

1041
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:24,788
were able to insert some code within

1042
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:27,558
that document that if you sent that file

1043
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:30,339
document in an email and got somebody to

1044
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:33,440
open it the code would execute and

1045
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:36,950
basically steal the key rings from PGP

1046
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,420
PGP is has a secret in a public key ring

1047
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,000
where the keys are stored you want the

1048
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:43,190
secret one obviously but this this

1049
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,079
little routine that they crammed into

1050
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,720
like 80 bytes or something like that it

1051
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,029
was you know it was a pretty it was it

1052
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,769
was a pretty efficient program that they

1053
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:53,990
copied the key rings out and would send

1054
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,819
it out the next email what do we call

1055
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:59,140
that

1056
00:42:54,819 --> 00:43:02,900
it's a phishing attack that was probably

1057
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:06,589
1995 so if you think phishing attacks

1058
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:08,150
are kind of a new thing they're not but

1059
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:11,210
I was as I was hearing them give this

1060
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:13,130
talk and and explaining it all to him I

1061
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:16,099
raised my hand at the Q&A and I said

1062
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:17,480
wouldn't that work against our stuff and

1063
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:20,410
they stopped him thought a minute and

1064
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,359
they said yeah

1065
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,819
so I was like well what's the big deal

1066
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:26,380
and they're like well we weren't asked

1067
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:29,950
to try to break our stuff we were asked

1068
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,150
to break PGP so full disclosure I don't

1069
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,359
know the answer to this but I don't

1070
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,460
think NSA ever broke PGP but I left

1071
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:38,710
there a long time ago they found an

1072
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,690
attack against the implementation at PGP

1073
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:43,059
and they exploited something surrounding

1074
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,769
PGP which is kind of what you do in

1075
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,309
cryptography another story for another

1076
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:47,618
day

1077
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:49,660
me meeting Phil all right I'm gonna give

1078
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:52,329
you your tradecraft I'm gonna give you

1079
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:54,519
one top secret so you're just between

1080
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,589
you and me I'm gonna share with you one

1081
00:43:54,519 --> 00:44:04,209
of our primary attack tools are you

1082
00:43:56,589 --> 00:44:06,058
ready you laugh but this was serious

1083
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:08,019
because this is what we had to deal with

1084
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:10,329
hopefully you're familiar with the ping

1085
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,598
command is the system alive are you out

1086
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:13,630
there

1087
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,119
are you responding it's a pretty common

1088
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:18,250
one of the most common tools at least

1089
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,789
back then in UNIX or Linux now just to

1090
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:26,049
see if things are up and running because

1091
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:27,970
the lawyers interpreted ping as what

1092
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:30,940
they called an act of an attack and they

1093
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:33,779
called it an act of attack because it

1094
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,730
elicited a response from the target

1095
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:38,859
because of that before we could issue a

1096
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,779
ping command we had to go through this

1097
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:43,390
bureaucratic process of getting

1098
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:45,609
permission to launch our attacks which

1099
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,049
in government bureaucracy meant there

1100
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:48,970
was a lot of managers at a lot of

1101
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:51,160
different levels that had to sign off on

1102
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:53,379
it and this was done on paper and paper

1103
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:56,019
that was manually passed from secretary

1104
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,730
- secretary - secretary and would sit

1105
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:59,529
there for a day or two before whoever

1106
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,359
had a chance to read it and sign it

1107
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:03,069
before it went to the next level and I

1108
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,170
had to go up one chain and over and down

1109
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:09,430
another 10 12 signatures

1110
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:12,039
could take weeks so imagine if before

1111
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:15,038
you executed something as simple as a

1112
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:17,470
ping command you had to wait for weeks

1113
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:23,680
if not a month to get permission to do

1114
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:26,980
so this wasn't working for us so we

1115
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,509
tried to talk to the lawyers and for

1116
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,920
some reason I sort of volunteered

1117
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:31,839
because I have a brother that's a

1118
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,910
lawyers and I think I could speak their

1119
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,770
language and

1120
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,390
the initial idea was the lawyers

1121
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,880
understood that they didn't want us to

1122
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:41,890
take so long to do all this stuff but

1123
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,380
you know there had to be rules there had

1124
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:46,930
to be sort of a basis standard operating

1125
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:49,000
procedure their idea was we'll just tell

1126
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:50,980
us all the attacks ahead of time that

1127
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,960
you do and we'll sort of pre approve

1128
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:55,089
them so when you get a new request in

1129
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,890
you can just kind of check off like an a

1130
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:58,779
la carte list we're gonna we're gonna do

1131
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,759
a little of this and a few of those and

1132
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,170
a little of that and we were trying to

1133
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,869
explain to them well that's not exactly

1134
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,670
how it is this is more art form than

1135
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:09,549
science you don't know what your attacks

1136
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:11,380
are until you start looking until you do

1137
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,670
the reconnaissance and the probing to

1138
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,799
see what you're up against you don't

1139
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:17,170
know what your attacks are gonna be so

1140
00:46:14,799 --> 00:46:19,059
we ended up saying why don't we teach

1141
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,829
you about the methodologies and the

1142
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:23,170
process so that you become comfortable

1143
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:32,559
with what we're doing and sort of

1144
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:34,359
demystify it yep so we decided that I

1145
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,010
would meet with the lawyers once a week

1146
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:37,930
and there was a show on at the time that

1147
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,700
was popular called home improvement that

1148
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:42,490
had a show within the show called tool

1149
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,890
time so we called our weekly meeting

1150
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:47,529
with the lawyers tool time and we did

1151
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,569
that for I I primarily did that for a

1152
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:53,020
couple months trying to educate them on

1153
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:57,609
what all this hacker stuff is

1154
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:59,140
I also took field trips with the kids so

1155
00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:00,819
word got out we were doing all this

1156
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,069
stuff it was all classified networks

1157
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:05,319
within NSA at first and with other

1158
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:07,509
military customers DoD classified

1159
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:09,970
networks but somewhere along the line

1160
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:12,730
this is actually a screenshot of an

1161
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:18,069
article that came out shortly after I

1162
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:21,279
left NSA but basically we were

1163
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:26,288
approached one day by the Department of

1164
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:29,559
Justice that wanted us to do our thing

1165
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:30,970
to their internet presence they had back

1166
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:33,039
in those days everybody had their own

1167
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:34,899
website which is all there was on the

1168
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,400
internet was a website and it was

1169
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,829
running on a server that was hopefully

1170
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,760
on a DMZ but it was basically part of

1171
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:45,309
the corporate network and the problem

1172
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,350
was DOJ was an unclassified Network and

1173
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:50,710
NSA's Charter

1174
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:52,480
meant that we could only basically we

1175
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,580
were only allowed to work on classified

1176
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,560
networks the organization that was

1177
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,330
supposed to do unclassified networks was

1178
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,700
the National Institute of Standards and

1179
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:02,170
Technology NIST but it was well

1180
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,390
understood at those days that NIST

1181
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,910
didn't have the capability or the

1182
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:08,680
technology to do any of this stuff so

1183
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,420
whenever they were approached there was

1184
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,569
sort of this process to go through to

1185
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:16,150
get it back to NSA in the first place so

1186
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:19,300
we embarked on this sort of months long

1187
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:21,130
process of getting going through all the

1188
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:24,490
bureaucratic hoops to be able to

1189
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:26,170
actually go and do an assessment the

1190
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:27,850
Department of Justice and it had to

1191
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:30,700
start with basically cabinet-level

1192
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:32,500
positions asking other cabinet level

1193
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,899
positions within the government hey can

1194
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,090
you do us a favor and let the NSA guys

1195
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:43,150
come and do their thing so this is a

1196
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:46,090
letter that came from the the Attorney

1197
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:48,700
General at the time Janet Reno asking

1198
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:51,160
the person that was responsible for what

1199
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,560
we would call today cybersecurity within

1200
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,350
the Department of Defense hey can you

1201
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,270
have NSA come and do their thing and it

1202
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,950
took a while but we were able to draft

1203
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:02,080
up a letter that had to come back from

1204
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,839
the director saying yeah we've signed up

1205
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:08,319
so this is I kept all this you know just

1206
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:10,240
to preserve the evidence but you know

1207
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,410
this is signed it you know we were gonna

1208
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,720
do the vulnerability and threat

1209
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:15,399
assessment it had a it had a cool code

1210
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,470
name it's in there somewhere

1211
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,940
project eagle or something like that and

1212
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:21,399
you can see my name on there I was the

1213
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:25,210
primary point of contact before we could

1214
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:28,630
get started this happened this was like

1215
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:31,360
the first breach of a DoD website which

1216
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:32,740
was egregious back in those days because

1217
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,470
the military is not supposed to have

1218
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,689
imperfect or insecure systems so this

1219
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:40,330
was big egg on the face because somebody

1220
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:42,790
defaced the website they took Janet Reno

1221
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:47,110
ID scroll down but it gets not suitable

1222
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:48,880
for younger people they took Janet

1223
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:51,340
Reno's picture and replaced her with

1224
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,880
Adolf Hitler and things like that so

1225
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,830
this big huge problem this had happened

1226
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,850
on like a Friday or Saturday they

1227
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:00,529
figured it out on a Saturday

1228
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,630
and back in those days if you had your

1229
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:04,310
website compromised you did what

1230
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:06,830
everybody would do you'd pull the plug

1231
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:08,750
Don it and you just took it off the

1232
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:10,460
network so I got a call on a Monday

1233
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:12,560
morning from the guy that I'd been

1234
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,570
working with at the DOJ to do all the

1235
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,330
point of contact making all the rim

1236
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:19,060
arrangements and he basically said help

1237
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:22,580
we've been hacked

1238
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:24,380
can you come down and help us so I hung

1239
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:27,500
up with him I got on the phone with the

1240
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:29,780
lawyers and I said well what you know

1241
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,550
we've got the paperwork we're like 99%

1242
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,050
of the way there what do we have to do

1243
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:35,840
to just get down there and help him out

1244
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:37,790
with what was new at the time still some

1245
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,010
sort of forensics exercise to try to

1246
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:42,470
figure out who had done it and how and

1247
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:45,050
all that kind of stuff so they gave me a

1248
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,020
little bit of criteria basically get it

1249
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:49,820
in writing get permission make sure the

1250
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,590
permission is in writing don't go of

1251
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,570
your own accord so I assembled the team

1252
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,520
people from the pit we went down there

1253
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:57,470
we were down there for a couple days

1254
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,920
when I got a phone call from the Home

1255
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:59,870
Office

1256
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,750
somebody that was stayed behind in the

1257
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:05,299
pit and they said excuse me be a the

1258
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:07,700
shit's hit the fan you guys got a drop

1259
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:10,130
what you're doing come back now so we

1260
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:13,669
did we had to drive up from DC back to

1261
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:16,250
our office where we got paraded into the

1262
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:18,950
deputy directors conference room and

1263
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:20,720
proceeded to get read the riot act by

1264
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:23,210
the same lawyer that I've been meeting

1265
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,459
with and working with for months to try

1266
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,380
to come to understanding and and

1267
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,510
basically they said you've broken the

1268
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:32,150
law you've done something that could get

1269
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:34,880
the director fired if not thrown in jail

1270
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:37,940
because NSA doesn't do what NSA does to

1271
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,220
u.s. citizens very blown out of

1272
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,020
proportion in my opinion but went

1273
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,569
through all sorts of hassle which again

1274
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:47,120
is another story for another day

1275
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:49,910
but the long and the short of it was

1276
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:52,250
they tried to fire me if not more and

1277
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:54,049
but anybody I talked to an internal

1278
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,490
security they kind of said we were just

1279
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:58,910
trying to help out what's the big deal

1280
00:51:55,490 --> 00:52:01,700
the big deal was political at the end of

1281
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:04,220
the day again another story for another

1282
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,930
day the highlight was I got to be a part

1283
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,609
of one of the first sans manuals on

1284
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,319
Incident Response I think I was an

1285
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:11,470
editor so my names in there somewhere

1286
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:15,100
it's probably in an arc

1287
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:17,080
somewhere but eventually when sorta

1288
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,850
everything settled down they took all of

1289
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:22,270
us that were in the pit back into that

1290
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:24,700
conference room and they said we love

1291
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:27,190
what you guys do we really want you to

1292
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:30,009
do it but if you're gonna do it here at

1293
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:36,010
NSA you've got to do it by our rules and

1294
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:39,520
so we said okay and most of us left the

1295
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:42,700
six of us today two of us are still at

1296
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,009
NSA doing god-knows-what four of us are

1297
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,480
out in the private sector two two of us

1298
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:48,370
want to stay anonymous

1299
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,990
the only other member of the pit that

1300
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:52,720
I'm allowed to say I have his permission

1301
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:54,279
to share gentlemen named Ron gula who

1302
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,629
went on to be the founder of tenable

1303
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:01,060
network security you might know that

1304
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:03,850
company from nessus so sort of an

1305
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,590
aftermath we left right after all this

1306
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:07,509
thing happened you know the the breach

1307
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:09,310
happened in August I was gone by the end

1308
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:12,340
of September

1309
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:15,520
another important date in history and

1310
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:17,680
I'll just skip forward that Chapter four

1311
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,230
of that book that was titled eligible

1312
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:25,120
receiver eligible receiver actually was

1313
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:28,420
the first joint coordinated hack of the

1314
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,100
DoD that was performed by NSA by people

1315
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,200
that I had trained and people in the

1316
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,860
pitted train and they did it after we

1317
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:38,140
left this is a picture of a round table

1318
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,030
of all the management suits all the you

1319
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,430
know the really smart people that had

1320
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,930
dreamed up this idea on the 20th

1321
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:46,839
anniversary they got together for a

1322
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:48,970
symposium to talk about it they actually

1323
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,650
released the redacted version of what

1324
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:53,049
had been like a 20 minute video that

1325
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:54,760
they did about the story and it was down

1326
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:56,380
to about eight minutes and I got to see

1327
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,850
a lot of familiar faces if you go to

1328
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,400
that website I think it's still up there

1329
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:01,930
the videos are there but for some reason

1330
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,520
they're not searchable but if you go

1331
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:05,620
there you can find them but don't think

1332
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,560
you can just google eligible receiver

1333
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:11,410
and find the video but basically this

1334
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,680
this coordinated attack was designed to

1335
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:16,029
take like two weeks it was an exercise

1336
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,310
people from NSA we're going to try to

1337
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:20,230
break into as many different DoD systems

1338
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:23,680
as they could Army Navy Air Force

1339
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:25,080
Marines and they had to cut it off after

1340
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,629
like two or three days because

1341
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:30,090
they owned everything and it started to

1342
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:32,400
get serious and so they had to suspend

1343
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:34,320
operations so a lot of lessons learned a

1344
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,630
lot of egg on the face exposing how

1345
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,050
insecure the DoD was and so on and so

1346
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,940
forth

1347
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:41,580
everybody was insecure back in those

1348
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:45,810
days laughs I think this is the last

1349
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:49,770
date anyone that's when nmap came out a

1350
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:51,420
year after I left NSA we still get

1351
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:53,660
together every once in a while one of

1352
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:56,850
the people that still works at NSA

1353
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:58,500
recently brought us some souvenirs so if

1354
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:00,029
you ever make it to Maryland in the

1355
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,580
United States and get to Fort Meade

1356
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,560
there's a Cryptologic Museum that has a

1357
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:07,680
gift shop and you can you two can own

1358
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,779
NSA secret sauce or you can get the cool

1359
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,029
bat-signal pen that's that that's

1360
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,950
actually a the NSA seal that's being

1361
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:15,630
projected by the pen that's not a seal

1362
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,879
on the coffee cup so you can get all

1363
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:19,860
courts you know t-shirts and mugs and

1364
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,330
all sorts of stuff I recommend that you

1365
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,790
visit the National Cryptologic Museum

1366
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:25,500
all the computers that I used to work on

1367
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:28,170
are now actually in the museum it's

1368
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:31,950
really cool it makes me feel old all the

1369
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:34,020
time so I went on to private sector I've

1370
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:36,930
been a consultant advisor for 20-some

1371
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:40,800
odd years still trying to fight the

1372
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:43,470
fight I'm on a paul security weekly

1373

1379
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,900

1409
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:11,549
escorts when I give talks and a couple

1410
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:13,430
years ago I was invited into a group

1411
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,960
called the Cabal of the curmudgeons

1412
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:18,299
which is basically a bunch of old timers

1413
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,670
that are kind of curmudgeonly and grumpy

1414
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,650
but having completely given up hope and

1415
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:25,470
all of this they meet and have dinner

1416
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:30,990
with the gentleman who's my laser

1417
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:34,410
pointer whoa I just turned off laser

1418
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:36,629
pointer anyway that guy right there

1419
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:39,089
gene Spafford he was one of the authors

1420
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:40,500
of that UNIX security book that I showed

1421
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:42,810
you back in the beginning he's been in

1422
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,330
this business 50 some-odd years and is

1423
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:47,790
really one of the architects of this

1424
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:49,140
thing that we call cybersecurity so a

1425
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:50,550
bunch of these old people get together

1426
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,920
and meet with them you have to be

1427
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:56,700
invited into this group and and somebody

1428
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,350
has to sponsor you the woman next to me

1429
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:01,200
was sort of our den mother when we were

1430
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:03,750
at the pit she was ex NSA and and she's

1431
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,460
very instrumental and hoping a lot of

1432
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:07,710
people out in career she was taught of

1433
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,330
behind the seeds scenes telling all the

1434
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:11,520
managers that didn't understand what we

1435
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:16,490
were doing it's okay let them do what

1436
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:20,310
they're doing she she sponsored me and

1437
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:21,689
in an ironic twist of fate the gentleman

1438
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:24,900
that I have my arm around in the red

1439
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:28,110
sweater he's actually the lawyer that I

1440
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,580
used to work with so we sort of I hadn't

1441
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:31,890
talked to him in 20 years but we got

1442
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,529
back together and so now we're friends

1443
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:37,730
and we just talk about the good old days

1444
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:39,980
when people were getting fired and

1445
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:42,840
stabbed in the back and things like that

1446
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:45,330
and just to round it out my family has

1447
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:47,610

00:59:56,779 --> 01:00:08,420
question apparently you get a hat hello

1466
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:10,578
first of all thank you for the wonderful

1467
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:14,329
presentation

1468
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:16,489
you talked a lot about one-time pad yes

1469
01:00:14,329 --> 01:00:19,069
do you believe that it will be still

1470
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:21,650
secure when we will get one two more one

1471
01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:26,470
time but as long as you're doing it on

1472
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:29,200
paper it can't be broken if you do it

1473
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:32,480
electronically there's always a chance

1474
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:37,609
okay so what do you think will it be

1475
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:39,230
baked or not like it was I would love to

1476
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:40,880
see it come back if you have information

1477
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:43,190
that you really really really really

1478
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,630
really want to keep secret using

1479
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:46,640
one-time pad because it can't be broken

1480
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:49,249
I mean I mean it's a no-brainer

1481
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:52,038
but it's not practical in today's modern

1482
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:54,319
world that's what I'm talking about

1483
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:56,680
because when we get quantum computers to

1484
01:00:54,319 --> 01:01:00,130
look at them yes we will be able to

1485
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:02,368
exchange the keys yes without problems

1486
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:04,859
yeah well

1487
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:07,049
even even with a one-time pad the

1488
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:09,089
problem with most cryptographic systems

1489
01:01:07,049 --> 01:01:10,859
is not people actually breaking the

1490
01:01:09,089 --> 01:01:12,449
cryptography or the algorithm it's the

1491
01:01:10,859 --> 01:01:14,969
key management it's the key distribution

1492
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:17,160
I mean there were some famous espionage

1493
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:19,829
cases that happened while I was at NSA

1494
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,078
where people that were you know spying

1495
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:24,809
for the Soviet Union were basically paid

1496
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,799
to steal the keys so the easiest way to

1497
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:30,269
break crypto is steal the key or

1498
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:32,699
somewhere in the communication on one

1499
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:35,308
end or the other you're decrypting or it

1500
01:01:32,699 --> 01:01:37,680
hasn't been encrypted yet so why go

1501
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:39,269
after the middle go after the endpoints

1502
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,848
I mean there's always gonna be a way to

1503
01:01:39,269 --> 01:01:43,738
get around it crypto cooktop

1504
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:45,890
cryptography and encryption is good

1505
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:50,999
historically for communications

1506
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:53,729
long-term storage is an issue but we you

1507
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:54,959
know I'm not a mathematician you know

1508
01:01:53,729 --> 01:01:56,879
full disclosure

1509
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:58,709
while the algorithms are getting better

1510
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,660
and better these days and longer and

1511
01:01:58,709 --> 01:02:04,558
longer there's still key distribution

1512
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:07,410
problems there's still ways around it if

1513
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,420
you focus on the crypto great but I know

1514
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:12,149
the algorithms although occasionally we

1515
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:14,219
find issues with them not very often and

1516
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:16,679
that was true when I was at NSA we

1517
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:19,439
weren't very often attacking the crypto

1518
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:22,410
itself or the algorithms we were taking

1519
01:02:19,439 --> 01:02:26,479
advantage of misuse bad security in

1520
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:26,479
terms of key distribution key management

1521
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:30,619
thank you very much

1522
01:02:34,009 --> 01:02:40,429
keep your hand up keep your hand up

1523
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,429
[Music]

1524
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:54,868
everybody's awake man thank you please

1525
01:02:48,449 --> 01:03:02,969
stand so we can see you hi I want to

1526
01:02:54,869 --> 01:03:06,079
know having worked at NSA how synced

1527
01:03:02,969 --> 01:03:11,039
with the current trends in technology

1528
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:14,130
are they they're you know 10 years in

1529
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:15,900
front of us they are because this year

1530
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:22,200
or this year

1531
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:29,549
deidre was released have they have it

1532
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:32,660
had it for ten years or was the the

1533
01:03:29,549 --> 01:03:36,270
process you know at the NSA

1534
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:38,308
so just flamer I left there twenty three

1535
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:41,190
years ago and I really didn't look back

1536
01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:43,710
so I don't in any way shape or form

1537
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:45,119
speak for NSA and I don't really know

1538
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,920
that much more about it than what

1539
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,289
everybody else does in the news other

1540
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:52,109
than when I'm reading the news and the

1541
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:56,010
media I I'm a little bit more aware of

1542
01:03:52,109 --> 01:03:58,558
when it's just fake news or not

1543
01:03:56,010 --> 01:04:00,599
completely accurate in terms of what

1544
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,250
they're reporting I mean even the book

1545
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:04,859
that I was showing you the chapter of

1546
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:07,470
you know knew that we were called the

1547
01:04:04,859 --> 01:04:09,690
pit but called the airport friendship

1548
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,578
Airport but it's been and and it was

1549
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:13,890
called friendship airport because it was

1550
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:15,690
built in friendship Maryland that the

1551
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:17,940
name was changed Baltimore Washington

1552
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:21,539
International Airport like back in the

1553
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:23,579
70s and I was there in the 90s so you

1554
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:29,039
know mostly accurate but not completely

1555
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:31,559
accurate NSA other disclaimer or

1556
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:34,020
qualifier we were on the defensive side

1557
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:36,359
doing red teaming I can't speak for what

1558
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:38,339
was being done on the operat on the

1559
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:41,759
operations on the offensive side in

1560
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:44,009
terms of computer hacking probably was

1561
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,690
going on there as well it was a

1562
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:48,119
different mission it was a different

1563
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:50,789
effort and certainly that is preceded

1564
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:52,380
you know the outing of ta over the last

1565
01:04:50,789 --> 01:04:55,650
couple of years I know a couple guys

1566
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:57,599
that used to be in ta o and when they

1567
01:04:55,650 --> 01:05:00,029
meet me they thanked me for sort of

1568
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,650
laying the groundwork somebody had to

1569
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:06,029
get beat up for doing it the first time

1570
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:07,770
and that was mostly us NSA as a whole is

1571
01:05:06,029 --> 01:05:09,779
struggling because you know the world

1572
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:12,720
has changed Communications have changed

1573
01:05:09,779 --> 01:05:15,539
the the availability of cryptography has

1574
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:19,169
changed and I see this a lot on our

1575
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:21,329
interviews on security weekly where a

1576
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:23,460
lot of the discussion seems to be going

1577
01:05:21,329 --> 01:05:26,460
back to older ways of doing things

1578
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:27,309
traffic analysis traffic analysis signal

1579
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,079
analysis

1580
01:05:27,309 --> 01:05:31,479
and the nation's you know we've had

1581
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:34,359
people on talking about oh you can pick

1582
01:05:31,479 --> 01:05:35,769
up you can exfiltrate data by using the

1583
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:38,019
blinking lights on the front of the

1584
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:41,589
server type of thing that's not

1585
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:42,999
necessarily new idea so I don't know how

1586
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:46,058
to answer your question because I'm not

1587
01:05:42,999 --> 01:05:48,729
I can't answer I can neither confirm nor

1588
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:51,279
deny that was our standards last

1589
01:05:48,729 --> 01:05:53,089
question thank you yes thank you Jeff

1590
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:56,820
this was absolutely amazing

1591
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:56,820
[Applause]
