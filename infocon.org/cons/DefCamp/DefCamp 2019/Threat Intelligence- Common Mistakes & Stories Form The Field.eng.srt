1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,700
well hello everyone first sorry for my

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:12,030
voice I'm trying to be as fast as

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:16,109
possible and as so that you can ya don't

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,710
have a bad experience good today's

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,910
agenda

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,400
I will we're going to run through a

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,720
short introduction a bit of tragic

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,479
legends history Ti top apologies next

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,210
we're going to TI fundamentals or

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,369
one-on-ones how we measure things that

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:38,550
we are really doing good what we are

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:41,790
doing and then set of takeaways short Bo

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,500
mo.si.ta professional trade intelligence

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,930
and hunting manager at signify

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,590
previously known as Phillips lighting no

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,170
hue bulbs yeah to put a picture on

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,879
perspective I'm working security for 10

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,430
years now

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,620
with vast experience in management

20
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,079
application security pen testing and

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,690
lately digital forensic analyst and

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,939
response some of you know some of you

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,830
might know me from previously almost

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,610
conferences I've been part of of those

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,860
events and for the past two years and

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,470
three months I've relocated myself to to

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,750
the Netherlands so busy I'm working what

28
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:24,689
signifies headquarter where I started to

29
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:28,979
organize some close CTI groups which I'm

30
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,130
which I'm part part of and as in threat

31
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,500
intelligence as in threat intelligence

32
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,520
community sharing is sharing is carrying

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,860
a discharge

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,220
I decided to share some of the stories

35
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,640
that I've been able to accumulate while

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,970
meeting with ti vendors of platforms or

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,049
feeds with other TI specialists from

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:56,908
various verticals across the Netherlands

39
00:01:52,049 --> 00:02:00,020
and the Benelux area so yeah let's let's

40
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,909
hope that everything is going to

41
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,949
entertain you disclaimer these stories

42
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,990
are not necessarily from my employers

43
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,360
I'm speaking for myself our stories

44
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,760
collected throughout this two-and-a-half

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,640
years almost period while meeting with

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,950
CGI professionals

47
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:20,820
so first well first what is what is

48
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:24,600
threat intelligence definitely not IOC

49
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:29,609
is definitely not a platform definitely

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:33,269
not a feat di is more than that yeah

51
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:36,180
obviously this is a cliche the

52
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,010
definition that garnered garner set up

53
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,650
so Tracey diligence is evidence-based

54
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,220
knowledge including context mekinese

55
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:47,550
indicators about existing emerging

56
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:51,540
threats again it's not mine is Gardner

57
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:54,270
so we have to believe them I guess kudos

58
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,790
for these slides goat goes to Andreas

59
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,670
Sparky on our keys which is a CI at

60
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,470
Shell Oil & Gas Company in the

61
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,630
Netherlands and in one of his

62
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,210
presentations earlier this year he

63
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:10,079
created a short timeline of when TI

64
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:12,030
appeared or when first signs of the i

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,100
appeared and what were the major

66
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,830
milestones you might be familiar with

67
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:21,000
Cuckoo's egg from Clifford Stoll in late

68
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:23,250
80s in Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory he

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,570
conducted probably the first digital

70
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,630
forensic investigation basically a guy

71
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:34,350
from East Berlin KGB officer tried to

72
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:38,160
infiltrate to to their University

73
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,750
Network and get out with some data he

74
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,120
conducted the first investigation then

75
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,380
along the 2000 we've seen a lot of

76
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,160
receive a lot of warnings and targeted

77
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:53,310
against targeted social socially

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,459
engineered email dropping Trojans to

79
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,830
expect rate sensitive data and this

80
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,019
information were published by either UK

81
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,269
Sartorius assert that doesn't

82
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,489
necessarily mean that until 2010 nothing

83
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:09,390
happened no there was a huge huge

84
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:15,570
activity but until 2010 there weren't

85
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:17,880
that many open source reports so moving

86
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,980
next we had stop tonight studnet I guess

87
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,590
everyone knows what students is it was

88
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,570
in 2011

89
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,400
cyber security kill chain was published

90
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,280
by by Lockheed Martin

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,710
first written report of a PT one but my

92
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,219
mind mandiant and sticks one framework

93
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:43,409
was released in 2013

94
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:45,720
moving next one more next we had her

95
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,660
bleed her bleed the first vulnerability

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,180
with PR associated with it with nice

97
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,180
logos and proprietary website and

98
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,630
everything then 2015 we had a talk mitre

99
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,729
framework PT a-- wanna cry spectrum

100
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,580
meltdown a little bit later and in

101
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,039
between guess what we had countless apt

102
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,719
groups cyber criminals state nation

103
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:12,750
state actors trying to hack into into

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,300
like everything good so the question is

105
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:20,220
now who's going to keep track of

106
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:23,220
everything of all these actors well the

107
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,039
good news or the bad news is that that

108
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,349
guy it's you and the second question is

109
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,930
are we there yet do we have enough

110
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:33,770
frameworks do we have enough

111
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,840
technologies I don't know training's

112
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,240
people trained to do that well

113
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,310
historically speaking cyber cyber

114
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,099
defense has been considered a reactive

115
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,510
job yeah so we have a critical gravity

116
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:49,139
we have to patch it we have an intrusion

117
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,180
we have to remediate that fast well the

118
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,639
product in the product changed a bit and

119
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,090
this approach is no longer sufficient so

120
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,949
that's why we have to for the emerging

121
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,020
cyber threats we need to handle we need

122
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,669
to handle them with cyber and cyber

123
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,109
threat intelligence best practices

124
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:13,049
rather through classic default shock or

125
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:14,340
IR mechanism bit of history with secret

126
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,070
operation centers they've have been

127
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,859
mainstreamed since 2005 more or less

128
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:24,719
they were focused on on inter internal

129
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,400
security and security monitoring for for

130
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,130
this type of services we have mature

131
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,159
best practices and standards and yeah

132
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,820
enough tech to to buy and and implement

133
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:38,039
what about vulnerability management

134
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,150
study says that it's adopted on large

135
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,710
scale since 2008

136
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:46,270
it's focused on internal and external

137
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:49,020
abilities hard hardly focused on

138
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:52,570
patching or reactively patching and yeah

139
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,719
we have still a lot of improvements to

140
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,030
do in the responsible disclosure area

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,520
mature best practices we have a lot

142
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,119
tools and technologies open source

143
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,070
commercial plenty of those

144
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,830
what about Incident Response well

145
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:11,889
started to be mainstream since 2010 more

146
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:15,300
or less focused on incident remediation

147
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:19,479
and risk escalation we have plenty of

148
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,560
best practices courses materials and

149
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:22,180
guess what we have some regulatory

150
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,560
controls as well that we have - we have

151
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:29,950
two met tools and tech planning next

152
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,039
final threat intelligence we are still

153
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:36,430
in the early stages of adoption with

154
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,349
this one throughout the trot my

155
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,970
experience I still see people that are

156
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,400
not necessarily dedicated for trade

157
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,360
Intel but they are half-half VMT i

158
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,179
Incident Response di or it's a part-time

159
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,169
job or a job done by a by a by a person

160
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:55,840
from from time to time mainly focuses

161
00:07:53,169 --> 00:08:02,080
its on external threat not necessarily

162
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:04,960
on insider threats or similar aspects

163
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,270
the good news is that we are catching up

164
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,239
fast there's a huge community behind

165
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:13,060
this one and even though the tools are

166
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,550
limited by the moment comparing with so

167
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,550
can I are we are evolving quite fast so

168
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,210
moving for more team moving forward

169
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,700
towards common common TI topologies as i

170
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,739
said i've been meeting with a lot of

171
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,270
companies on one-on-one meetings also in

172
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,250
larger environments while attending

173
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,520
conferences or events organized by TI

174
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:41,589
vendors be it platform or feeds or

175
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:45,970
whatever and I've kind of summarized for

176
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:50,920
big topology topologies and mistakes

177
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:53,170
that are being made first first

178
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,040
first apologies the anchorman the trait

179
00:08:53,170 --> 00:09:00,189
intelligence which is an anchorman what

180
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,129
this person does usually sends out sends

181
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:05,699
out a news or a link on a slack or on

182
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:11,199
skype on a team's or whatever

183
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:13,988
broadcasting news spreading fear and in

184
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:16,199
the same time gives a false sense of

185
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:18,730
security to everyone

186
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:21,339
definitely a TI guy should not do that

187
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:25,449
don't send just the link give some

188
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:28,480
context around that one the next type is

189
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:32,849
crying wolf I wanted to name this one

190
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,179
before the Undertaker Undertaker the

191
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,639
gravedigger

192
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:39,519
why is that because this type of threat

193
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:43,419
intelligence analyst comes either from

194
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,759
on MSSP either is it's a vendor or

195
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:47,559
internal or or an external threat

196
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,559
intelligence analyst who wants to

197
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,850
impress your sister or your sock manager

198
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:54,279
hoping that might be hired or something

199
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:58,290
I have no idea why why what are his

200
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:00,669
intents and basically he is sending out

201
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,290
emails to to you to the fraternal list

202
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:07,860
seeing again your sis or your sock

203
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:11,799
manager with copy pasted from dark web

204
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:14,499
news about set of credentials from your

205
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:17,410
company being on sale or being on on

206
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:19,089
market on dark web or similar or similar

207
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:24,009
stuff like that or you are IP is being

208
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:25,989
exposed exposed usually these types of

209
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:28,449
persons literally can throw you under

210
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:31,299
the bus and can derail you from your

211
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:34,569
from your course from your natural way

212
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:36,549
of doing things towards a firefighting

213
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:38,199
activity because guess what the Cisco or

214
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:40,419
the stock will come to you and ask you

215
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:42,609
hey what's with that why didn't you

216
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:48,459
found out that before why do I have to

217
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:50,709
be informed by somebody else next we'll

218
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:55,118
have the the handyman this actually is

219
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:57,998
very funny one I was invited to attend

220
00:10:55,119 --> 00:11:00,220
an event on a vendor at attractive great

221
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:02,829
Intelligence Platform vendor and feed at

222
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,780
the same time told to have a

223
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,370
presentation how I use the

224
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,930
and up at the platform data that we've

225
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:12,760
acquired soon after that we were asked

226
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,130
by the vendor hey what types of features

227
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,810
do you like to see next in the in the

228
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,900
platform so it was like a change

229
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:23,079
advisory board more or less and one of

230
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:25,780
the clients presents there they bought a

231
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,430
tool and they started to come up with

232
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:31,630
some crazy features they wanted to

233
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:34,660
implement to build in a messaging module

234
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:38,140
they wanted to build super advanced

235
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,060
roles in a role based access control to

236
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,520
give access to that platform to hundreds

237
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,839
of people tour from the business so that

238
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,670
they can spread out news events threat

239
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,750
advisory newsletters and so on and so

240
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:54,510
forth and the guys that the vendors were

241
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,160
like dude sorry you're doing it wrong

242
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,220
you're doing completely wrong you buy a

243
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:04,390
scissors while you need to the hammer

244
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,440
does the handyman yeah so you literally

245
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,530
don't know what you what you've

246
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,310
purchased last but not least is the

247
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:14,380
cheap bastard I've called it in one of

248
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,099
my one-on-one meeting with with an other

249
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,240
company from from a separate industries

250
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,830
usually during these occurrences we try

251
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,390
to exchange information about a what

252
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,030
feeds are using are they relevant for

253
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,810
you talking about vendors how do you

254
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,730
perform various operational tasks and

255
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,660
this person said something like hey we

256
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,250
do not use a threat intelligence

257
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,740
platform we do not use threat

258
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,560
intelligence at all because they

259
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,150
generate incidents and we have a cap in

260
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,020
terms of how many incidents we can raise

261
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:46,449
with our MSSP that translates into hey

262
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,850
we are in the week three of the month we

263
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,000
reach the cap higher guys you're free to

264
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:56,040
go from my perspective that's completely

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,810
wrong of two completely wrong doing cgi

266
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,770
so on our question towards you and I

267
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,319
really want some answers

268
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:07,120
what do you believe at least one common

269
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,480
thing these four topologies have what do

270
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,480
they miss

271
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,450
not really

272
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:22,650
another try maybe what do they miss

273
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:24,600
sorry intelligence as well I'm going to

274
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:28,650
help you requirements setting up

275
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,870
requirements and this is the the bedrock

276
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,880
of trait intelligence if you don't have

277
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,400
a requirement set up you have no idea

278
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,340
what you are doing you're going to as I

279
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,010
said send out news send out links act as

280
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,540
a firefighter then what type of

281
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,819
requirements do we need and have

282
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,770
strategic you need to know in what what

283
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,670
sector of business you're working in

284
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,310
what countries

285
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,699
what are your critical assets your crown

286
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,109
jewels

287
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:57,120
what what what systems are important in

288
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,900
critical and might be appealing for the

289
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,360
bad actors operational you have to you

290
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,060
need to have requirements from people

291
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:11,100
processes procedures you need feeds as

292
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:12,540
well service providers technical so in

293
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,480
you need to define recurrence for your

294
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,730
stock to link your rival sees you have

295
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,770
to know how much network visibility you

296
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:25,680
have in your company and last but not

297
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:28,710
least tactical yeah good and who's going

298
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,469
to do all those things that's you that's

299
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:36,330
you the threat intelligence guy or girl

300
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:38,660
or department and that's the bad news

301
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,990
the good news is that you are not alone

302
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,280
you're not alone in this process because

303
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,980
raters have to have some requirements

304
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,010
from the seesaw office many companies

305
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,760
many companies are are have their own

306
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:56,400
seesaw Department set up in in various

307
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,140
shapes you have to go to risk to the

308
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,610
risk in compliance check the risk

309
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,000
registries

310
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:05,580
what are your risk accepted risk

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,940
accepted so far are even herbal in that

312
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,700
space or not awareness you have to

313
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:15,210
feedback some some information to the

314
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,580
awareness manager the brain security the

315
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,680
production way to get your business yeah

316
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,600
you're offering threat intelligence and

317
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,579
you try to protect the business itself

318
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,499
they are the driver

319
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:28,239
supply chain it's a it's a very

320
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:30,959
important one contract and vendor

321
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,499
management if if you have an MS SP or

322
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:37,449
whatnot supplier in your in your supply

323
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:40,300
chain you want to know how vulnerable

324
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:42,459
that guy is or that company's because

325
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,660
guess what that's an inherited risk for

326
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:49,479
your for your business as well others

327
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,910
our procurements facilities marketing IT

328
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,850
you need to know what software in hard

329
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:59,230
that you are using so that you know what

330
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:01,480
to look after outside and last but not

331
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,639
least put it separately the shock IR

332
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,529
data even our instant response

333
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,689

334
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:12,610
so on depending on what your sock is

335
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:15,490
structured can have huge input from your

336
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:19,569
side or vice versa in the middle it's

337
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:22,540
you the treat intelligence person but

338
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:24,519
that just ops three that's just the

339
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,699
first phase of the threat intelligence

340
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,259
lifecycle planning in Direction setting

341
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:30,399
up requirements talking the business

342
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,339
talking to IT to other departments

343
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:39,819
knowing what try to figure out what you

344
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:43,000
have to do what's next yeah that is that

345
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:45,040
if you have some requirements set up you

346
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,680
will you'll eventually be able to dodge

347
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:53,469
the the anchorman snooze and Undertaker

348
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,269
as well whereas for the other two two

349
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,370
cases the handyman in Chi bastards

350
00:16:55,269 --> 00:17:03,910
sorry but you are still doing completely

351
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:07,449
wrong movie next trying to bring some

352
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:09,819
solutions or way to organize your your

353
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:13,260
work in such way that you will not

354
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:15,819
become one of the four topologies or two

355
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,109
to try to escape the trap that they are

356
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:22,658
trying to set up to you template eyes

357
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,729
everything create processes deliver

358
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:26,679
consistent in a repeatable with

359
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,280
repeatable actions with foreseeable

360
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,630
results autumn on before autumn izing

361
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,428
everything you have to put things in

362
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:37,710
template trade intelligence briefs

363
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:40,420
awareness messages whenever you have a

364
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,310
news-breaking in the in doubt in the

365
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,990
news outlets you have to have the

366
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,490
template prepared you have to have your

367
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,090
words with you you have to put it in in

368
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,310
writing and then send it out fast you

369
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,810
don't want to have your seaso bringing

370
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:57,370
the news towards you you have to go

371
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:59,320
first technical reports responses to RF

372
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,449
ice vulnerability intelligence and

373
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,540
metrics templatized everything so that

374
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:06,550
we can act fast few examples try to

375
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,800
advisory reports actually this is

376
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:14,620
another common mistake and a story from

377
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:16,270
a flute I was in discussions with with

378
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,840
the trade intelligence platform and feed

379
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:21,340
provider for a proof of concept and he

380
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,490
was like hey you know what during this

381
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,030
period you can ask us how many things

382
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,550
you want

383
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:31,450
countless RFI's you can send towards I

384
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:33,340
was like yeah awesome let's use that and

385
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,590
guess what I've tried to I've tested

386
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,270
tested that product what whatever I was

387
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,149
doing or that that product the service

388
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:42,639
sending me copy paste from various

389
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,460
articles from the Internet dude I'm

390
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,170
trying to leverage you as a service to

391
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:53,140
help me in streamlining my process I can

392
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:56,860
do that part myself so that's why I'm

393
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:59,200
saying template is everything put have a

394
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,540
have a defined structure bottom line up

395
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,310
front yeah use the bluff for the

396
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,790
executives for your see so he has to

397
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:10,030
figure out everything from that once one

398
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:11,100
one slide what give some information

399
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,040
about the trade details

400
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:17,050
so what afterwards okay we have that

401
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:22,899
tread how does it and how does that

402
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:24,940
impact us so what of the so what what

403
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:29,190
can we do about it what compensatory

404
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:31,330
controls can we bring to stay protected

405
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:35,290
recommendation sources and then some

406
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:38,850
appendices moving next verbally

407
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:42,159
intelligence the liability management

408
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,379
department should be your friend

409
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,870
you're not going to impress VM if you're

410
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,340
going to send them vulnerabilities they

411
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:52,060
have tons of them

412
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:54,580
they have tenzin of emails with reports

413
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,990
with follow-ups to patch with critical

414
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,429
vulnerabilities that are not being

415
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,950
installed so on and so forth

416
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:02,620
put things in putting Xena in a template

417
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:07,000
start small start an Excel started an

418
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:09,129
email give them also an overview of

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,350
what's happening and explain them how

420
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:15,490
this will await you that you are sending

421
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:17,490
them it's more important then they

422
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,180
already have in pipeline again

423
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,250
requirements if you know what your

424
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:24,150
critical assets are your software and

425
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:27,130
hardware inventory can work on

426
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:30,270
developing such templates for for the

427
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:33,970
critical assets that and that you have

428
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:37,270
fishing that's an important one isn't it

429
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:39,640
I think it's still the the most

430
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,620
important attack vector that is used by

431
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:47,740
the cyber criminals nation-states and so

432
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:49,479
on and so forth if you're not going if

433
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,050
you're not analyst analyzing fishings

434
00:20:49,480 --> 00:21:02,800
you likely have little knowledge of

435
00:20:52,050 --> 00:21:05,080
who's attacking you sorry do you know

436
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,970
what campaigns have have been have been

437
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,379
targeting Harvey have been targeting you

438
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,700
what types of fishing do you have were

439
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,320
they looking for conditional harvesting

440
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,350
where they're losing looking for

441
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,899
dropping on our access single URL

442
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:22,330
something else try to inventory those

443
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,820
things again start small start an Excel

444
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:31,330
go to a collaborative platform put it

445
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:34,060
there in order to collect this data yeah

446
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,580
some samples of phishing emails that

447
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,649
that can be used to drag and drop

448
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,610
information in your in your templates

449
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:47,950
oops so we are in the second phase yeah

450
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:50,500
if we started to collect data but yeah

451
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:53,110
what are you going to do with them my

452
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,930
solution is measure success try to

453
00:21:53,110 --> 00:22:01,110
define some metrics

454
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:02,550
this is a metric a graph taken from from

455
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,909
trade connect they are trading tell

456
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,530
provider you have plenty of metrics out

457
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,320
there but if you are going to count how

458
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,420
many reports were issuing that's

459
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,689
probably not going to help that much if

460
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:19,980
you're going to count how many i/o sees

461
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:21,780
you've seen in various you have from

462
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,280
from a digital vendor how many of those

463
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,320
I have seized generated some incidents

464
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:30,690
you might have some some return of

465
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:32,490
investment good I'm proposing some of

466
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,250
the some of the metrics some some

467
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,800
metrics here you've started to register

468
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:41,850
those data's in Excel collaborative

469
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:44,570
platform whatnot you have one one year

470
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:48,060
worth of data put them in perspective

471
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:53,220
try to understand what are the what what

472
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:55,710
do the lows and high means here in May

473
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:59,250
you might have implemented SPF checks

474
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,170
and Hakeem yeah so logically you'll have

475
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:05,280
a drop in them in terms of phishing

476
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:09,390
emails next in August I don't know maybe

477
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:12,330
a vacation season try to understand why

478
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:15,510
you have such low numbers of fishings oh

479
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,669
we have a spike here Black Friday's is

480
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,640
approaching everyone is bombarding us

481
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:22,860
with offers and whatnot they try to -

482
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,320
you have to drop us malware - to steal

483
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:31,080
our credentials try to understand and

484
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:36,210
read the numbers what if you add another

485
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:39,540
criteria there Joe location yeah you've

486
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,300
registered again over over a year you

487
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:45,570
split it all the all the fishing

488
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:48,720
categories and guess what you you see

489
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:51,780
some you see that in in Africa we have

490
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,210
fraud on a proton on on the rise take

491
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,100
that information with you draw some

492
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,880
conclusion and use them a little bit

493
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,879
later in the presentation

494
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,750
initial harvesting that's an important

495
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:09,428
one what about trying to understand what

496
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:12,380
departments are more prone to be phished

497
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:15,970
yeah what department with what type of

498
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:18,140
category of phishing attempts

499
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:21,559
disseminate that information try to

500
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,660
figure out who are your who are your

501
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:26,950
enemies and what they are trying to get

502
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,220
out from from your from your company

503
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:32,330
good

504
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:35,510
but you had enough of writing emails and

505
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:38,689
Nick cells and put it putting things on

506
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:40,610
the on the collaborative platform try to

507
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,309
integrate and automate and why not

508
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:46,070
orchestrate some of these actions on

509
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:48,309
this play the picture itself it's an

510
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,710
architecture I've drawn many years ago

511
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:53,780
in the top you have a SAS solution at a

512
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,230
trade intelligence platform in the

513
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:59,030
middle you have a staging server so an

514
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,179
integrator that you probably have it on

515
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:05,920
Prem and then you have integrations top

516
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:08,740
left with your IT service management

517
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:13,460
tool yeah the place where you store your

518
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:15,860
incidents your security incidents stored

519
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,570
there's a my OCS creator create an

520
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,129
integration and try to drag some

521
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,159
information from the from the toydarians

522
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:24,290
platform and enrich the data of those

523
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,230
IOC give some context additional to the

524
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:30,889
incident management guys in the right

525
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:34,100
side there's the web filtering solution

526
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:37,010
if you're certain of that some ICS are

527
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:43,040
really really bad Singh hold them block

528
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:46,250
them yeah you you keep seeing phishing

529
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:49,370
coming from websites from domains that

530
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:52,100
are similar to your brand yeah def camp

531
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,649
with two FS or Pina code or whatever

532
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,689
take that information send it to office

533
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,610
365 or whatever male gator you have

534
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,179
block the receive the incoming emails

535
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,620
from from those from from those

536
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:06,740
attackers but also collect that

537
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,570
information for further analyzes also

538
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,960
connected to the scene to the endpoint

539
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:14,149
detector detector response tool and why

540
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:18,170
not create at the end DNS sync hauling

541
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,610
a solution sent to gnarnia

542
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:26,810
all diocese that you strongly believe

543
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:28,899
that are are bad good what I can do with

544
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,590
this one afterwards in the vanity

545
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,530
manoeuvrability intelligence you can

546
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:36,409
start aggregating known CV that are

547
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,149
being exploited with the vulnerabilities

548
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,580
that are being scanned and are present

549
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,200
in your scene create some use cases

550
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,270
raise priority in terms of patching so

551
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,060
that VM will know when to act and work

552
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:49,160
to act that will also help IR to act

553
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,659
faster on the configuration items on the

554
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,290
servers that are affected by an incident

555
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:58,910
and are also vulnerable available to a

556
00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:00,470
known exploitable vulnerability are you

557
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,990
collecting data about a specific

558
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:06,440
software that keeps popping popping up

559
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:09,680
in your in your in your news try to

560
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,510
automate patching convince the business

561
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,150
to get rid of that one because it's an

562
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:17,420
risk that will remain in your company

563
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:21,440
for the rest of your life be proactive

564
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:23,540
things of think of things phishing

565
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,380
intelligence you can have tailored

566
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,790
awareness messages and tailored

567
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,450
simulating simulated phishing campaigns

568
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:35,840
I keep seeing that hey you receive a

569
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:38,000
parcel from DHL click here that's

570
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,310
relevant that's relevant for finance

571
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,770
department or for someone from R&D that

572
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:47,419
is not receiving any goods anytime take

573
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,920
that information to the sis office to

574
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,840
the security board to your security

575
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,130
architect and draw some conclusion build

576
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,070
up your security roadmap for your

577
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,890
following years also use the threat

578
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,419
intelligence feed in a smart way

579
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,880
it's up to you to figure out where you

580
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,170
want to where we want to enrich the

581
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,200
informations that you have in your

582
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:08,660
incident is it in the scene is it before

583
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,010
you hit a use case after you hit a use

584
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,270
case you may have some limitations

585
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,760
probably with virustotal

586
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,680
or with with domain tools in terms of

587
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,360
how many API calls you can have per per

588
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,400
second if you're going to ingest

589
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,260
millions of viruses in your scene yes

590
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,770
what your your cost will will increase

591
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,120
and you'll hit up the trash holes for

592
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:28,629
for the for the api's that are being

593
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,629
limited

594
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:39,100
good next try to understand diocese that

595
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,540
you've collected part of the incidence

596
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:45,320
from which trade intelligence

597
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:48,889
they've come are they relevant for us or

598
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,360
not because if you're an oil and gas

599
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,670
company and if you are buying a threat

600
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,500
intelligence provider that is more

601
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,870
geared towards financial institutions

602
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:01,070
sorry but your pick up your you've

603
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:05,120
picked your own battles look at look at

604
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,860
these informations take outside the open

605
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,540
source trade Intel that are not relevant

606
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:15,399
to you filt ratings and and draw some

607
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:17,840
conclusions again from from this data

608
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,330
most of them sees nowadays comes with

609
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,990
comes with tags they have associated

610
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:28,100
with them the mother family may be a Joe

611
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:32,030
location some of the original providers

612
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:34,699
have started to attach also cyber

613
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:42,500
security cyber kill chain cyber security

614
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:45,500
kill chain indicator of compromise some

615
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,350
of the some of the the feeds offenders

616
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,690
started to to attach cyber security kill

617
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:54,980
chain tags there so that you might know

618
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:56,930
that I will see for what type of the war

619
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,120
type what type of attack in in which

620
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:02,030
phase of the cyber security keychain is

621
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:06,110
is happening again

622
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:13,370
take that information play with it data

623
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:16,070
is gold the next slide it's borrowed

624
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:18,820
from David G Bianco the guy that

625
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,629
invented or patented the pyramid of pain

626
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,550
I've seen this and in one of the

627
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,510
conferences I've attended earlier this

628
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:32,330
year try to put in perspective things

629
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:34,850
you have frameworks we have the pyramid

630
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,860
the diamond model we have cybersecurity

631
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:39,620
kitchen you have attack my tray take

632
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,428
those things try to combine them based

633
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,248
on

634
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:45,970
you believe it's best for you it's good

635
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:49,700
to know what types of viruses you have

636
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:54,619
in comparing to the pyramid of pain

637
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:57,440
versus cybersecurity kill chain top left

638
00:30:54,619 --> 00:31:02,629
it's a good quadrant yeah it's good to

639
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:06,110
see some some artifacts in the delivery

640
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:08,269
stage versus just IO C's I was his are

641
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:15,529
easy to collect artifacts a little bit

642
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:17,330
harder again right right down if you if

643
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:19,909
you if you if you're able to catch up

644
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:22,960
here some of the some of your your

645
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:26,860
attacks your you're really really good

646
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:30,409
top right is the best and hardest one

647
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:33,769
again take your IOC is put them use the

648
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:39,789
frameworks use the models and define

649
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:42,080
meaningful data good so we moved fast

650
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:45,769
requirements collecting processing and

651
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,320
exploring with drones or metrics we've

652
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:55,159
analyzed them a bit what we're going to

653
00:31:48,320 --> 00:32:00,320
do with them next try to not lie

654
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:02,360
yourself don't cut corners try to figure

655
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,279
out the information that you've put it

656
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,258
together are really true and meaningful

657
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:08,360
for your for your company from your

658
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:14,059
environment from your risk appetite or

659
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:16,369
your company's risk appetite what's next

660
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:18,259
filling the loop you're going to go back

661
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:21,590
you're going to feed that information to

662
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:27,309
the C's office to the business to other

663
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:27,309
departments to IT into the sock

664
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:38,689
takeaways don't be a crying wolf an

665
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:43,658
undertaker a handyman or a cheap bastard

666
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:46,460
do it smart know your requirements and

667
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:49,720
fill the fill the loop build your own

668
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:53,119
requirements don't try to copy others

669
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,820
programs it might be might not be a

670
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,899
success

671
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:59,250
you have to adapt as I said a threat

672
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,140
intelligence feed from or from offshore

673
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,600
banking come before banking industry

674
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,510
will not fit in a manufacturing oil and

675
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,889
gas automotive it's separate story you

676
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,420
might have some hits but you're going to

677
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,020
pay heck a lot of money on a feed that

678
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:15,960
is not relevant to you in the middle CTI

679
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:19,770
is more than feeds IOC's logs and tech

680
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:23,820
platforms good those are enablers but

681
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:27,060
will not necessarily help mature your

682
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:29,939
program there are different approaches

683
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:33,330
maturity models tools and an way to do

684
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:37,500
it and the final thought is wash rinse

685
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:41,159
and repeat played the loop game over and

686
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,740
over again so that you can you can reach

687
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:46,050
to a certain maturity maturity level

688
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:49,830
that you are really you're really

689
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:51,030
confident that it's it's good thank you

690
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:58,939
very much

691
00:33:51,030 --> 00:34:09,540
[Applause]

692
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:11,399
questions so I haven't jr. City Island

693
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,899
right alpha so I have thousand questions

694
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,219
if you have some time afterwards I

695
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:17,629
really would love like to share some

696
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:20,339
experience but one of them would be like

697
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:25,290
experience would be like the best

698
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:28,078
dynamic inside a team of nine people

699
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:30,239
working in CGI and patenting combined

700
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,010
how do you give the rules

701
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,888
do you give the rules or shoot everybody

702
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:37,440
like be good at the same stuff like that

703
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:40,230
kind of dynamics how do you split it up

704
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,349
and Google what did you exactly what did

705
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:46,918
you see that works best in those

706
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:48,210
conditions split the responsibilities

707
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,638
amongst yourselves because if you're

708
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:54,470
going to have one person doing VM

709
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:59,520
reporting and reports it will get bored

710
00:34:54,469 --> 00:35:04,169
used job rotation within your team micro

711
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,210
job rotation template is everything

712
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:08,510
you're bored of me or filling in

713
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:13,530
templates automate move to the next step

714
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:20,400
I was a job rotation is the the best the

715
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:23,569
best example that I can give you job

716
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,569
rotation inside your teams yeah

717
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:37,350
I've seen multiple approaches something

718
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:42,200
like sorry as I said look I'm screwing

719
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:45,990
one side don't try to copy someone yeah

720
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,819
adapt I've seen companies in which they

721
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,950
have analyst of the day or something

722
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,140
like that so that analyst is responsible

723
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:56,250
for all the incidents or all the alerts

724
00:35:52,140 --> 00:36:01,319
in the scene or for entire week I've

725
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:03,060
seen other companies which have really

726
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,380
strict roles and responsibilities

727
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:11,250
defined with very small amount of

728
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:14,550
overlap between teams it's up to it's up

729
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,310
to you if you have a six ninety nine

730
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:22,710
people in your city I I do invite you a

731
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:28,529
lot okay all right let's take some more

732
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:30,240
questions hey you had like common

733
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,670
mistakes in the field like in the title

734
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,180
of yours yep what was the most

735
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,320
disastrous or to be honest funniest

736
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,600
implementation of CGI you have ever seen

737
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,260
like you've already given us the example

738
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:45,630
of the handyman where they want yeah

739
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:48,030
instead of CPI that's the worst and I

740
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,800
haven't said everything on that one so

741
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,220
funny funny thing is that two three

742
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,580
months after that vent I went to to the

743
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:59,160
other company and we had like a very

744
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:02,250
intimate meeting and we started to share

745
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,140
how we do things and they said that they

746
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,900
had to go in their knees to their Cecil

747
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,310
to beg for the integrator I think in the

748
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,740
middle because they were just collecting

749
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,660
feet but guess what they were not

750
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,209
delivering them to the downstream

751
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:18,180
systems to the EDR to the theme to the

752
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:21,210
no DNS sinkhole whatever whatever you

753
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,730
have no your requirements know what you

754
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,160
want to do okay you have like a lot of

755
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:31,320
money I do invite you but do it smart

756
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,420
please and the second one with a with

757
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,230
the Undertaker a story that I forgot to

758
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,630
mention again in a one-on-one meeting

759
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,230
with another company there was a guy

760
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,240
that

761
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:49,350
literally was exasperated by a by a

762
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:54,720
fellow TI guy who had sent him 75 emails

763
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:56,670
in the past year with news with things

764
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,140
that he believed that they were not

765
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:03,840
worthy but again he CCD the sis organ so

766
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:06,618
that guy literally for one year has to

767
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,170
justify that he is doing his job right

768
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:12,230
while trying to literally say that that

769
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:16,320
guy is stupid

770
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,800
out of those 75 verifies let's put it

771
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,830
this way

772
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,250
just two irrelevant so basically again

773
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:27,299
he had to work one-year time to make his

774
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:30,330
case to go to the seaso and say hey it

775
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,430
just ignore that guy that that's why I

776
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,990
said Undertaker literally they can throw

777
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,049
you under the bus and derail from your

778
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:40,290
folks alright let's take some more

779
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:42,300
questions on that side so representation

780
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,820
thank you for wrapping up conceptually

781
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:49,010
you had to ride with success management

782
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:51,320
and my question is you know to get this

783
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,270
performance indicator of revenue saved

784
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,310
what do you do with return of mitigation

785
00:38:54,270 --> 00:39:02,310
when you don't have any monitoring of it

786
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:05,009
not hear anything so you had a slide

787
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:10,650
with success management and there you

788
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:13,350
had revenue saved yes and my question is

789
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,980
what do you do with return of mitigation

790
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,910
and any quantifiable or

791
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,280
indicators when you don't have any

792
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:22,410
monitoring available so say for example

793
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,080
you don't have si si you don't have as I

794
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:26,640
am and so on you don't have what sorry

795
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,410
the last you don't have any monitoring

796
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,900
available so you don't have an SI yeah

797
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:33,540
more access okay what seem okay good so

798
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:38,040
bullet but still the question is how do

799
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:42,960
you how do you just justify your effort

800
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:44,520
on mitigation and on security because

801
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,990
this this is really difficult but I I

802
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:53,070
wonder if you have any any ideas no

803
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:53,910
literally no I I can say I'm I'm lucky I

804
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:57,599
literally cannot on

805
00:39:53,910 --> 00:40:00,808
stand how people are doing city I win

806
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,990
without having a sim or any dr or some

807
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:07,260
logs in there good you can look at them

808
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:11,029
you can Marie actually I like I may have

809
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:14,609
an answer you can monitor things about

810
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,280
your brand your products on the dark web

811
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:19,380
on the darknet try to figure out what

812
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,950
type of information the the tractor

813
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:28,289
might have stolen stolen from you and

814
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:30,899
make make an outside impression of the

815
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:32,220
how things work because I think it's

816
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,819
which they can use monitoring or

817
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,169
something that really sort of again I'm

818
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:39,599
really privileged to have some

819
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,359
visibility in what I'm doing yeah that's

820
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,730
definitely important we know the CI so

821
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:48,029
from a cam I actually mentioned BC

822
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:51,119
visibility as main main component focus

823
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:52,380
on the outside world maybe there are

824
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,109
some trade intelligence feeds and

825
00:40:52,380 --> 00:41:00,390
platforms that can help you in that

826
00:40:55,109 --> 00:41:02,299
direction thanks very much thanks yeah

827
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:05,160
one more question

828
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:06,990
hi do you think that it would be

829
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,848
beneficial for sock to take part of the

830
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:12,979
threat hunting activities with the city

831
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:12,980
item whoa

832
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:19,859
i that's another common mistake god damn

833
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:23,729
it so i Canada I cannot understand how a

834
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:27,420
city I team its outside of soccer i I

835
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:28,559
cannot I cannot believe it so has

836
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,260
another one-on-one meeting with other

837
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:40,289
vendor the financial sector and the CTA

838
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:42,150
team was under legal so completely

839
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,010
outside of the stock they had some

840
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,480
translations platform it's on feeds but

841
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:47,900
no correlation with the incidence and

842
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,430
event monitoring logs and everything so

843
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,770
what I can disclose something from my

844
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:56,848
from my job I'm literally sitting

845
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:59,940
between VM and I am I are isn't man even

846
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:01,920
instant response I cannot I cannot see

847
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,270
myself working differently as a city I

848
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:18,950
or threat intelligence Lester hunting

849
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:22,310
professional do you find sorry behind

850
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:26,960
honey pots useful because they're quite

851
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:29,779
cheap to emulate a honey pots deception

852
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,260
technologies yeah obviously that's super

853
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:35,660
useful to have in your in your network

854
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,220
side of your network collect the

855
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,710
information try to figure out what ATP's

856
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:42,319
are being used against you or can be

857
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:45,220
potentially used against you and yeah

858
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:50,120
use that information put it in reports

859
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:55,250
fill the loop any other way okay doesn't

860
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:58,910
have one here hi two-part question

861
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:00,950
please um so to start off I take offense

862
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,270
to your just for generalization of the

863
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,810
type of personalities when it comes to

864
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,970
Ti

865
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:07,190
I think that each of them are very

866
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,149
important like the crying wolf is

867
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,440
important because if you're going to

868
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,420
talk to business owners you don't want

869
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,490
to do that fifty times over and over so

870
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,370
self management on that one helps the

871
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,689
handyman is gonna be good because if you

872
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:21,250
don't have buy-in from the business side

873
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:23,690
then you're not gonna buy the product I

874
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,910
do understand what the cheap bastards

875
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,500
are seen as a problem but the cheap

876
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:30,080
pastures is also what's keeping us from

877
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,990
becoming handyman in a different area so

878
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,700
that's a good thing but part of the

879
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,200
question is basically where do you find

880
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,220
yourself between those or helped you

881
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,930
describe yourself in terms of

882
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,330
personality of those four types that you

883
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:43,640
present it I'm none of those four

884
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:46,340
technologies but then don't you feel

885
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,799
that would have been your obligations

886
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,360
also list that as a because basically

887
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,500
you only bashed on the type of

888
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,110
personalities that you've encountered

889
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:57,050
and I'm not I'm not trying to put you

890
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:58,730
down I'm just saying that when they have

891
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,230
benefit or helpful so to provide the

892
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:06,850
positive examples not just what you

893
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:11,930
avoid so here we treat advisory boards

894
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:14,120
this is the evolved way of anchorman so

895
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:16,220
we read the news about an external

896
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,290
threats Pravana BT put it in a report

897
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,649
send

898
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:22,180
Birkett is broadcasted which is true but

899
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,910
you have started with that argument that

900
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,109
you the anchorman can go to this result

901
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,879
and this would have been your start this

902
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:30,220
would have been your end and that would

903
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,650
have been more helpful and that one and

904
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,379
my second question would be I love the

905
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:37,540
diagram through the orchestration but

906
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,540
what have or if you have ever

907
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,080
implemented that like what was the ratio

908
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,460
false-positive and like what was the

909
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,240
business impact afterwards when you

910
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:49,540
implement it but first false-positives

911
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,310
rates or rates were high but again wash

912
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:53,440
rinse repeat should take that

913
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:55,420
information try to figure out what's the

914
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,940
what's the ballast put that away and

915
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,710
keep up keep keep inside only the

916
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,900
meaningful information that can help

917
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,790
your business and then how would you

918
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,080
have faced the pushback so for instance

919
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,060
I would move you to like a different

920
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,799
area and let's say you'd work for

921
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,880
Schneider would still be electric and

922
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,920
you work with other types of panels and

923
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,080
obviously those IOC s or like you can't

924
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,880
necessarily DNS and Co just based off of

925
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,830
that so how would you have dealt with

926
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,900
that to still filter out the stuff that

927
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:24,250
you legitimately need you know into

928
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,870
would you have taken wins your

929
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,700
consideration or treated separately the

930
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,890
bottom or would you have so automated

931
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,250
them and then flush them out through

932
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:38,799
endurance second option maybe flush them

933
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:39,280
out as a little not let's take one more

934
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,970
question

935
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,970
go ahead

936
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:58,750
that's change okay so today there is

937
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:01,480
relatively easy to come by you can just

938
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:04,210
tons of potato now I'll tell any best

939
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:08,700
practices for retiring ready to attack

940
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,700
IOC is octagonal artifacts and so on

941
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:20,760
this one do they produce incident or not

942
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:24,130
that first one thing that I would do

943
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:27,280
what about certain infrastructure

944
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:29,380
something is being used I cannot hear so

945
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,960
what if malware infrastructure for

946
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:34,150
example is being used there is a quiet

947
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,010
period for about six months and then it

948
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:38,020
starts to get to be used again good

949
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:40,180
let's put it this way if you're going to

950
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:43,030
buy a feed from a vendor you'll end up

951
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:45,339
with millions of ICS over the night if

952
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,500
you're going to buy two three four

953
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,630
vendors you'll have millions multiplied

954
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:53,530
with that number if you put that

955
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:55,390
information to us plunk that will

956
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:58,170
generate a lot of cost additional costs

957
00:46:55,390 --> 00:47:01,420
yeah if you go to your sister with that

958
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:04,930
probably it will have to cut some some

959
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:09,070
of your budget you have to do some you

960
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:14,799
have to make some you have to take some

961
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:16,660
decisions you cannot have them all so

962
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,370
again which one are the best and

963
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,350
relevant for you for your business for

964
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:24,069
your program for your appetite risk

965
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:26,470
appetite of your company okay thank you

966
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:27,970
all right thank you thank you for the

967
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,180
presentation it generated a lot of

968
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,180
discussion
