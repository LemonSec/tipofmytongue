1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,770
we're really super glad to see you guys

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,470
on our next generation cyber Wi-Fi talk

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,960
and today we are going to discuss about

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,730
our approach how to teaching security

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,799
operation team on how to detect

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,820
cyberattacks how to mitigate cyber

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,220
attacks and how to configure

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,439
cybersecurity tools for many different

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,820
infrastructure types ok let's go

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,439
my friend Tilly I and I where

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,019
researchers in information security

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,380
field and we are conduct penetration

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:35,160
tests on daily basis and constantly

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,700
faced with defense and Blue team during

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,870
our projects and very often but also

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,270
we'll stay undetected so we decided make

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,760
brief research on why this has happened

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,530
and today our talk will be as follow

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,620
we're talking about actual problems in

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,739
security operation team we then we will

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,989
discuss about existing methods to solve

22
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,390
management problems discuss about

23
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,188
drawbacks and benefits of teaching

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,510
security operation came through traffic

25
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:13,020
replay CTF like attack defense and quiz

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,909
gaming after we do try imagine ideal

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,570
solution for teaching security operation

28
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,750
team and requirements for this after all

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,710
we demonstrate you how we realize these

30
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:29,220
requirements in our teaching solution

31
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,139
which called Empire also we're talking

32
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,539
about technical issues technical

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,810
problems which we faced why we realize

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,180
this solution and of course we show you

35
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:43,890
what benefits you could get if you use

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:48,210
this approach let's start begin with a

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:51,420
sock operation problem due to ABM data

38
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,460
brief support in this year incident

39
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,829
detection and reaction time is a two

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,619
hundred and seventy nine days two

41
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,809
hundred and seventy nine days this is

42
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,040
much more longer than was the area and

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,009
this concludes there are several

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,220
important issues related with use of

45
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,750
cyber security to skills of

46
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,620
configuration skills of detection and

47
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,470
mitigation cyber attack consequences

48
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,170
and also maybe due to intercommunication

49
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,510
between blue team and security operation

50
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,470
team monitoring team and respond to him

51
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,609
and what is the main problem think about

52
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,970
it

53
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,829
modern security operation center

54
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,959
includes at least minimum three key

55
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:35,709
roles incident responders security

56
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,700
operation analysts and treat hunter yeah

57
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:41,360
based on their own names

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:44,599
this is dream team which can save world

59
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,329
from any cyber attack here but why not

60
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:51,518
highly skilled hacker compromised his

61
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:53,989
system why we have several crews and

62
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,000
problem number one you can see

63
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:59,599
screenshot from emerging print website

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,260
containing open rules for snore database

65
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,540
and we can see this rule alert security

66
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,870
operation team if they were white and

67
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,989
user agent in the request okay surely

68
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,599
normal user not use Python for self

69
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:19,130
internet or maybe open Internet pages

70
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:22,540
such as FBI dot-com yeah but what if you

71
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:26,239
a hacker is it really hard to bypass of

72
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,959
course no after googling how I change

73
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,410
how I can change my user agent in button

74
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,919
request you give an answer and for any

75
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:40,069
security operation team your normal user

76
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:43,519
let's look another example when your

77
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:46,940
fruits are built as follow if count of

78
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,879
and connection time if current attempts

79
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,949
connect to host organ attached great to

80
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,078
when five per minute then security

81
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:57,829
operation teamwork his IP address and

82
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:01,669
mark he's a hacker but religion is that

83
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,359
many years it's a list of most popular

84
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,569
password

85
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:09,560
look like this yeah and when information

86
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:11,540
security tools aim to check a many one

87
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,120
password for many hosts for several

88
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:17,029
costs for example click map exact allows

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,329
not only to replace rashes but to check

90
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:23,760
one password to on several hosts and for

91
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:26,550
security team we are again a normal user

92
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,550
and trouble number three due to

93
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,550
checkpoint there are around 33 millions

94
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:36,270
attacks per day including dangerous want

95
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:40,130
and but mostly there are BOTS and script

96
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:44,039
kiddies here as you know if you imagine

97
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:46,860
of this events in ideas dashboard it's

98
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,690
really hard to highlight important

99
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,900
attack vectors that could compromise

100
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:56,490
your system and if you should pay

101
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,479
attention to all his you wouldn't have

102
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,090
time to react

103
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:04,920
this is why average incident responder

104
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:08,700
time is at 279 days and after defining

105
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,920
all some all problems in the security

106
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,229
operation team we are talking about

107
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,650
existing methods for solve this problem

108
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,560
and first up one is code of business

109
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,659
games lectures quiz game you may know

110
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,000
about such events when information

111
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,030
security specialist I divided in groups

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,030
and trainer ask a questions and trainer

113
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,770
give a right answer for these questions

114
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,469
for different situations that may arise

115
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,479
during creel cyber attack yes this

116
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,960
interesting approach but this approach

117
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:43,200
have benefits and drawbacks benefits is

118
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,630
organizational cost and only one

119
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,479
restrictions for teaching this is room

120
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:51,240
size but drawbacks this is only

121
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:55,730
theoretical knowledge and only simple

122
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,860
attack reactors method number two

123
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:01,980
actually it was created to test ATS

124
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,520
rules in the defy false-positive in

125
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,250
ideas rose network traffic replay which

126
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,130
approach could be used to demonstrate my

127
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,530
new vulnerability and not me to have

128
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:17,490
professional training attacks and not

129
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,200
have any professional trainer drawbacks

130
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,570
for this method always identical

131
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,539
behavior and two simple text vectors and

132
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,700
Method number free CTF

133
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,160
CTF is a great approach yes but

134
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,080
unfortunately even this also matters

135
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,780
there are drawbacks complexity of

136
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,700
infrastructure maintains and

137
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,469
and ability to repeat specific attacks

138
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,870
because every attacks where team in CTF

139
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,210
and also there are only one

140
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:52,020
infrastructure and if you want to teach

141
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,909
one team on the office network and you

142
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,780
want to teach to another team on the

143
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:00,210
bank office what to do so we decided to

144
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:05,849
try answer all mention questions and

145
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:08,219
create our solution what is the cyber

146
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,380
training cyber training is an event

147
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,630
where information security professionals

148
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,310
we have different level of training to

149
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,780
teach on how to detect and mitigate

150
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,850
cyber attack consequences so cyber

151
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,520
polygon is a platform where cyber

152
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,470
training can be conducted so firstly you

153
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,590
need to elaborate list of requirements

154
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,600
and create cyber polygon core which you

155
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,390
include maturity of previously benefits

156
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,690
and have the possibility to adapt as per

157
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:41,310
user request now let's move on

158
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:43,500
requirements first of all personal Isis

159
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,120
simultaneous trainings the platform

160
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,400
needs to have possibility to Train

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,590
security operation team to detect

162
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,650
analyze and mitigate cyber attacks

163
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,880
different attack reactors for every

164
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,870
infrastructure we should have

165
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,490
personalised attack scenarios next one

166
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,100
possibility to use different reaction

167
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,260
tools as per security operation team and

168
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,680
this is needed because different teams

169
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,750
use their own tools our mission is to

170
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,300
provide the survey polygon with Verity

171
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:15,440
of open source and proprietary solution

172
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:19,440
to simulate a real-world infrastructure

173
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,640
like cisco ii on open source Palo Alto

174
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,930
and Check Point and another important

175
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,810
requirement to our platform is

176
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,060
availability availability for training

177
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,789
trainer who select infrastructure and

178
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,950
conduct cyber training possibility to

179
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,890
select iveco attack reactor for selected

180
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,360
infrastructure and shock student who has

181
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,179
access to reaction tools

182
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,950
interface and every host infrastructure

183
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:47,250
and interface to interact with trainer

184
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:49,650
and with other students for

185
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,140
communication and also possibility to

186
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,420
conduct

187
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,660
no trainings on different infrastructure

188
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,660
if you wanna teach one group on the

189
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,780
network templates and another group on

190
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,939
the bank office in the premier every

191
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,740
training you have only necessary action

192
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,490
tools which I use in typical

193
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,460
infrastructure and let's collect our

194
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,920
requirements and once while these

195
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,230
automated attacks much put simultaneous

196
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,630
trainings and personalized trainings and

197
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,090
of course infrastructure is customizable

198
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,939
and easy for use for training for

199
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:28,180
students and repeatable attack scenarios

200
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,760
and fully autonomous finally all these

201
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:34,359
requirements was implemented in our

202
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,780
teaching platform Empire now I want to

203
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,640
talk about key features of this platform

204
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,610
let's start let's start with many

205
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:46,000
networked employees we have a two-man

206
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,430
team plays as such as bridge office and

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,760
enterprise surface during summer

208
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,920
training our platform uses and Rises

209
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,490
real infrastructure consisting of

210
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,040
virtual machine at any moments you don't

211
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,620
have possibility to interact if n is

212
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,540
this cost and templates have Network

213
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:09,490
segmentation and traffic emulation Rayo

214
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:14,230
users one of many a check and our

215
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:17,590
platform name is HTTP fully autonomous

216
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:20,800
attackers start in map scanning found

217
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:24,400
HTTP host with Drupal 8 use Drupal get

218
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,449
on and after provide internal scanning

219
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,730
service found a SSH and provide the

220
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,610
cessation boot force use post

221
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:38,050
exploitation techniques and after G be

222
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:43,390
compromised this platform is a for

223
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:50,079
teacher have friendly interface and easy

224
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:53,410
for student and now students are divided

225
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,690
into two groups who detect events and

226
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,850
who check these detects and fix

227
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,460
vulnerability in this platform

228
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,740
the second group using information from

229
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,850
first group and knowledge about will

230
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,250
shown for

231
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,930
tries to fix vulnerabilities such as SQL

232
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:13,690
injection reverse engineering tasks and

233
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:18,760
walk and containing configuration

234
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:21,990
through admin panel and of course we

235
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,510
have this amazing vegetable like CDF for

236
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:30,910
feedback between trainers and students

237
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:32,410
and now I show you okay platform I'll

238
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,709
show you how to interact with the

239
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:40,750
platform we have record video we wanted

240
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:42,640
to make like live demo but due to issues

241
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,260
which we will show you a video if you

242
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,330
want we will show you after the

243
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:51,160
presentation the live one so as Sergey

244
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,350
mentioned the system have different

245
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,199
roles for the teacher for the students

246
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,940
they are divided into two groups the

247
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,580
reaction team and mitigation team let's

248
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,790
login as teacher we have a dashboard

249
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,760
with all the trainings that this teacher

250
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,819
have been created previously with

251
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,460
incident created by the students with in

252
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,960
the top part you can see it has seven

253
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,660
users created three templates available

254
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,480
three trainings you can see them on the

255
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,000
left part and one student created by the

256
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,290
user the users tab has all students it

257
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,260
ever created and the groups he has a

258
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:32,370
sign of them too so he can create the

259
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:37,050
users I assigned them to groups to know

260
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,940
which users can passed or assign them to

261
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:47,319
specific training groups let's create a

262
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:51,610
new group and assign users to this group

263
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:55,750
so you feel like login first name last

264
00:12:51,610 --> 00:13:02,080
name email and assign users to specific

265
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:05,440
click create a new group so after the

266
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,540
group is created we can create the

267
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,900
training so you can see the list of

268
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:14,410
trainings completed they are finished

269
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,930
and the progress status for instance the

270
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,629
second change is failed on 72%

271
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:24,689
so you know it's not been finished so

272
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:24,689
create a new trend they've come 2019

273
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:32,350
click continue select the template every

274
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:34,089
template has the attack script connected

275
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,119
to this template on the image you can

276
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:39,220
see the list of boxes and P addresses

277
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:43,029
this information also available for the

278
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:48,069
student during the infrastructure

279
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:52,689
investigation so we select an office

280
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:57,569
template select best scenario it has one

281
00:13:52,689 --> 00:14:02,290
scenario DePaul get on the another

282
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:04,628
another template has the name of the

283
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,498
company it is much bigger than the

284
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:10,029
previous ones

285
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:12,699
many subnets and also with different

286
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:17,170
scenarios connected to invest select the

287
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:20,979
attack on database and continue we

288
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:26,199
select the group Sauk students continue

289
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:28,120
and we should select the detection team

290
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,969
all the another students automatically

291
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,670
pass to mitigation team their training

292
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:39,759
case appears on screen he still not

293
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:44,319
started so to start them you should use

294
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:51,220
another screen with which contains all

295
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:53,199
information about this training let's go

296
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,439
to dashboard that's the main dashboard

297
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:00,549
you previously saw so select the

298
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:03,670
training they've come 2019 you can see

299
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:07,839
the left side the main lunar abilities

300
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:09,459
that should be mitigated to successfully

301
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,499
complete the training by the students

302
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:13,508
the monitoring team the defense team and

303
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:16,689
we in right side the incidents created

304
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:21,309
by the monitoring team the locks from

305
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:26,230
the script are available below the three

306
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:28,089
main boxes and you click a start button

307
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:37,210
and script starts to

308
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:42,610
in trade via network so he still

309
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:46,350
produces the 3% locks are appearing on

310
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:49,690
the screen and now we will again as

311
00:15:46,350 --> 00:16:00,430
monitoring students to see what is

312
00:15:49,690 --> 00:16:11,410
available for him a little paused to

313
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:13,890
admire the beauty of this screen one

314
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,890
second

315
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:23,250
so another the main dashboard in

316
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,610
incident taps contains the only

317
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:29,490
previously created incident and when the

318
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,820
users are start start to create the new

319
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:35,959
ones

320
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:40,620
they appear on this screen yes we login

321
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:48,750
with another account the students is in

322
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:51,209
a group of monitoring team so he has

323
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,610
information about trainings completed

324
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:56,550
and still in progress so he likes the

325
00:16:53,610 --> 00:17:00,240
Deaf camp the incidents are empty so he

326
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:03,199
uses linked to the sensor or sixel

327
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:08,160
security tool he uses to detect the

328
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:13,109
animal it is in traffic he walks him and

329
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:17,970
he uses the Avensis like you can use any

330
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:23,059
ideas or you a solution you like so he

331
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,059
investigates the events that are now

332
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:28,678
appeared so he sees the map scream T

333
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,090
tangent is detected on the user agent

334
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:35,760
you can investigate the packet he sees

335
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:41,000
the destination that source address of

336
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:48,570
attack the new events are appearing

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:51,740
constantly and this is how he may assume

338
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:55,230
that something happened on the network

339
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:59,700
it's a simple example but of course you

340
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:02,160
can use another tools or more complex

341
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:08,640
more it depends on what you want to

342
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:11,880
teach the students so after detection of

343
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:16,169
an incident he sees the emerging threat

344
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,820
exploit PHP rule fired up so he may

345
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:21,880
investigate the rule and find that

346
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,879
[Music]

347
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:37,550
yeah he finds information that it was

348
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:41,690
created by executed at Drupal sites web

349
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:44,659
page contains Drupal so he knows the

350
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:48,620
source and destination addresses and he

351
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,990
now may create an incident to monitor to

352
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,820
reaction team to solve this or try to

353
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:59,180
investigate what happened in the network

354
00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:02,480
so he creates incident gives us a name

355
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:05,450
also fills the source address the

356
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,680
affected host the indicators that might

357
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,960
contain information how he received this

358
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,610
information about this incident maybe he

359
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:20,600
used the ideas maybe he used another

360
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:37,639
tool so he feels all the fields and the

361
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:40,879
date also they said no time and he might

362
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:44,090
upload the file contains packet capture

363
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,180
- if monitoring his reaction team is

364
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:50,800
unsure he can check also the file and

365
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,800
may make some conclusions

366
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:03,879
the description about the incident - for

367
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:07,330
the reaction team it will be much more

368
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:11,440
easier to investigate if he was

369
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:15,840
information of about what happened and

370
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:25,090
why the reaction team thought that it

371
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:27,189
it's real innocent in incident in rent

372
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:33,220
accommodation he pulls the check this

373
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:37,800
host or blog this host or investigate if

374
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:45,280
it's another attack and investigated so

375
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:50,290
he created an incident it has a score

376
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:54,970
the trainer can also see this incident

377
00:20:50,290 --> 00:21:01,300
and rated from 0 to 5

378
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:03,730
also there I chat window like if the

379
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,750
monitoring Direction team or the trainer

380
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:16,630
and doesn't understand something he can

381
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:23,190
write a comment and and find out another

382
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:26,560
clue or something so it was the trainer

383
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:30,100
he just marked the vulnerability or the

384
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:36,060
incident card with the five stars so now

385
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:36,060
I can begin as a reaction team member

386
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:54,610
also the same screen the trainings the

387
00:21:49,510 --> 00:22:00,810
incidents created by the PHP report what

388
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:07,419
he investigated is the affected host and

389
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:15,580
using where he has linked to his working

390
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:17,830
computer can LDP to it and he now in he

391
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:23,770
now in the network it's in a training

392
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:28,360
network itself like using his computer

393
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:30,700
inside the right information security

394
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:38,979
officer computer inside the vulnerable

395
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:41,710
network so he any tools can be

396
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,040
pre-installed is there to solve the

397
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:51,220
issues he checks the webpage of the

398
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:56,950
affected host while it's loading he/she

399
00:22:51,220 --> 00:23:01,690
can use the SSH to connect to this host

400
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:09,730
and investigate the operating system or

401
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:16,410
logs so he says that the browser load

402
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:16,410
the web page to the triple-eight he

403
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:31,859
finally she managed to login and he uses

404
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:34,079
the net stat to find out that the

405
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:39,389
session is established from the attacker

406
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:44,569
host to this host to mitigate the Drupal

407
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:48,958
Kadam vulnerability she may update the

408
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:50,849
Drupal or she may disable the user

409
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:55,440
registration functionality through which

410
00:23:50,849 --> 00:24:01,619
the payload was delivered so he uses his

411
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:09,479
credentials and disables the user

412
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:14,579
registration functionality all he

413
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:17,999
attacks are checked with scripts if they

414
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:22,559
were mitigated so when she fixes the

415
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:25,019
information about the that the issue is

416
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,589
mitigated will automatically be shown on

417
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:32,369
the trainers and the students and the

418
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:38,428
main screen I'll show you later the main

419
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:40,589
screen that contains all information for

420
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:44,459
this particular training - available to

421
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:47,158
the users who are watching the training

422
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:53,399
so we see that Drupal given to was

423
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:58,109
mitigated and what if if student decides

424
00:24:53,399 --> 00:25:01,678
just to shut down the host the scripts

425
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:07,289
also checked this and if the host is

426
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:09,690
shut down the the status of new

427
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,089
abilities you will encounter so you that

428
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,949
the issue is not mitigated and the

429
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:17,609
service is unavailable for you this main

430
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:20,519
dashboard contains also key owner

431
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:23,819
abilities the time left for restraining

432
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:27,269
the status of incidents created

433
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:30,569
mitigated and the statistics so this can

434
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:33,080
be shown for any users because the

435
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:43,220
information about the vulnerabilities

436
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:55,119
without the names so he shuts down the

437
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:55,119
host and one second

438
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:05,760
and after the host shut down and passes

439
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:11,370
same amount of time the in without

440
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:14,280
responding the mobility will change its

441
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:18,060
color to blue and this is how the

442
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:21,840
trainer or another students now that the

443
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:25,080
vulnerability is not fixed so this was

444
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:28,290
the quick demonstration of the platform

445
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:32,340
and integration between trainers and the

446
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:34,530
users so when we develop the platform

447
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,730
faced with several technical issues I

448
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:40,320
want to share you with you

449
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:42,990
so for instance we know sometimes when

450
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,020
you do a penetration test you use the

451
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:50,010
matter perjure so once we developed one

452
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:54,000
of our scripts we notice that sometimes

453
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:57,900
the SSH connection with the host doesn't

454
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,940
work so we stray we try to investigate

455
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,610
what happens and we not just when you

456
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,160
use the pivoting in amateur perjure not

457
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:09,979
this the default meet after not the

458
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:17,040
Python not PHP the standard meterpreter

459
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:19,710
the SSH packets are reversed we get in

460
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,050
reversed order sometimes so we googled

461
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,470
and we found that this vulnerability

462
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:29,879
exists for two or three years and nobody

463
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:33,210
fixed this so be aware if you use this

464
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,970
and were unable to find the password for

465
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:40,710
when brute-forcing so it might be the

466
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:43,530
case also one of the technical issues

467
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:46,620
about the instance isolation because you

468
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:52,670
have several you may have several Perl

469
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,669
trainings and for the students the

470
00:27:53,330 --> 00:28:01,580
template one and template to need to be

471
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:01,580
completely isolated from each other so

472
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,440
we created a different network with a

473
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,929
static addressing

474
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,730
and with dynamic and racing the network

475
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,290
with the dynamic addressing is above the

476
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,420
network of the static address if the

477
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:19,629
static addressing network is the

478
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:22,780
vulnerable enterprise and the stat in

479
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:25,960
the dynamic addressing contains their

480
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:30,160
hosts needed for the services that sends

481
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,170
the statistics to dashboard energy to

482
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:38,230
interaction with the trainers and the

483
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:42,610
users so another problem you might face

484
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:45,070
if you develop something similar is you

485
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:49,990
need a spam port of course and the spam

486
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:52,510
port should be different for each of the

487
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:54,580
networks because you cannot send this

488
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:58,450
the information about the network

489
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:00,780
traffic to another training so to solve

490
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:04,270
this you can write a custom

491
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,490
configuration to the virtual switch as

492
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,800
if you use VMware it contains the vetos

493
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,320
fish also the open source solutions also

494
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:16,300
has the open milto switch so you can

495
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:20,800
configure them what can be done with

496
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:27,149
this platform you can of course train

497
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:29,860
the soap teams you can also train put

498
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:33,510
replace the automatic attacker with the

499
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:37,300
real attacker and also complete

500
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:39,520
differents we passed one or two

501
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,060
trainings and the fig with what was

502
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,460
really positive even from the people who

503
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:50,800
are in this field and not only the

504
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:57,250
students who just learn to in in cyber

505
00:29:50,800 --> 00:30:02,409
security field so also you can use this

506
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:04,090
platform to write some tools because you

507
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:10,570
have the infrastructure you can test

508
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:14,949
your tools on this platform you can of

509
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:17,500
course teach students and teach students

510
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,650
to communicate because during one of our

511
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,299
ones we saw that even the students the

512
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,820
monitor

513
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:26,399
team and reaction team were near each

514
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:31,918
other they didn't in communicate because

515
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:33,988
they were asking us why we can find in

516
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:38,700
one step how the checker penetrated from

517
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:41,789
this segment to another and the another

518
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,399
team said in front of them they knew the

519
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:49,289
answer but they did not cooperate with

520
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:52,439
them so also you can use such platforms

521
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:55,289
to test the hardware for instance

522
00:30:52,440 --> 00:31:00,109
compare ideas solutions firewalls and

523
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:03,600
other tools needed to detect the attacks

524
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:08,629
what's for the future we plan to like

525
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:12,080
it's like a concept not like really

526
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:14,699
major product we want to create the

527
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,309
attack and network scenario network

528
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,159
builders to give the possibility to

529
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:22,700
trainer to create the new

530
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,429
infrastructures and the attacks from

531
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:30,059
some primitives that they have

532
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:33,109
pre-programmed also you can like create

533
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:39,269
some certifications based on such

534
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:43,100
platforms thank you for this for reading

535
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:43,100
that's all may be questions

536
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,290
so since we are providing trainings I

537
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,150
believe that this will be our it

538
00:31:52,290 --> 00:32:08,760
question would you be so kind to go back

539
00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:11,130
to the slide six five six yes so here

540
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,560
you have description of thread hunter

541
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:16,920
being a guy who is performing an

542
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,690
automatic stance to determinate if there

543
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,060
are some vulnerabilities in the network

544
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:26,120
this is clearly outside of the scope for

545
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:28,379
threat hunting deer hunting is based

546
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,080
assumption that network is already

547
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,660
compromised and trade hunter is working

548
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,939
in order to prove or disprove the

549
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,180
hypothesis like for example X filtration

550
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:42,840
filtration of the data using DNS

551
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:49,910
requests so you may want to correct that

552
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,909
okay thank you for this thank you

553
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:03,850
I'm just curious if you have a public

554
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:06,950
trial version for for us to try this out

555
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,260
we can we can discuss so if you're

556
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:12,950
interested we can yes show you something

557
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:16,100
but now it's an available publicity to

558
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:19,760
the full Internet all right so yeah you

559
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:23,419
just select customers right no we don't

560
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,190
sell yet it's like it's like say you're

561
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:44,540
a proof-of-work or something

562
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:48,020
I see thank you there are scoreboard for

563
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:51,710
students or something or in what in

564
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,480
which way the teams are created for it's

565
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:57,110
not only for students it's also to

566
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,960
improve the skills of existing teams but

567
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:02,179
of course firstly there need to be

568
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,490
implemented the real scenarios in more

569
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,730
complexity edit to network itself and

570
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:11,690
the field with the solutions you want to

571
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:15,199
be in this you have to be a teacher to

572
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:21,020
create teams or get access to various

573
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:24,159
platform the teachers are not to be

574
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:26,570
highly qualified because they can use

575
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:33,170
the platform and the attacks are

576
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:35,950
automated so the purpose of teacher is

577
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:39,770
to create the group or also create some

578
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:42,379
tasks for knowledge now it creates on

579
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:46,100
the group and selects from predefined

580
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:50,360
pre created tasks and fires the training

581
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:53,239
okay so if he's he has skills he yes he

582
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,370
can access the platform and modify the

583
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,819
script but from the interface now it's

584
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,819
unavailable

585
00:35:03,799 --> 00:35:13,470
how long does it take you to build a new

586
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:16,799
network schematic or a new now it's not

587
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:19,618
really hard because like it depends it

588
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:24,180
depends on the size but like we have for

589
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:33,450
the components it's not really long but

590
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:35,970
like and you're probably having the

591
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:39,990
machines pre-scripted before and you

592
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:42,029
just raise them up so the original

593
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,890
question that I wanted to ask is do you

594
00:35:42,029 --> 00:35:46,289
actually change the passwords for the

595
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:53,190
accounts to improve reusability of

596
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:54,930
scenarios or the passwords the passwords

597
00:35:53,190 --> 00:36:00,029
for the accounts I mean you create an

598
00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:01,859
entire infrastructure there change the

599
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:10,349
credentials for the users in the

600
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:15,410
directory course even you can't you can

601
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:15,410
build the boxes from the vagrant or son

602
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,130
yeah

603
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:50,520
from the beginning or no but now you can

604
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:54,450
use like I know yes now it's nervous

605
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,380
it's not really long like but depends on

606
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,379
complexity also

607
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:36,450
okay you have a mic hello thank you for

608
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,090
the presentation really interesting but

609
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,879
I was wondering where we can find some

610
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,859
updates because you said the is not the

611
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,140
own Internet you are working on this

612
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:49,590
project and when we're going to be

613
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:52,230
finish it we plan in half a year to

614
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:55,560
finish all what we want so you can

615
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:58,530
contact us if you're interested it's

616
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,540
only for companies maybe the project

617
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:04,020
will gonna be like hack the box maybe

618
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,840
for all the students we wanted to build

619
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,490
a cloud version but it's we need to

620
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,310
raise an infrastructure it's like a

621
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,140
costume of money so it's it depends on

622
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:16,320
what the future of the project will be

623
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,240
so the solution is to for the companies

624
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,140
to buy infrastructures and also the

625
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:27,209
software from you now yes now okay thank

626
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:30,540
you so you can take one more yes yeah so

627
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:33,960
we have here regarding the

628
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:37,619
infrastructure you're using classical

629
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,869
VMs or toker technology Williams

630
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:45,150
classical classical have you thought

631
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:48,390
about using docker yes we can but the

632
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:53,550
problem is the the real boxes are more

633
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:55,650
like more real and for the training the

634
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:59,070
stock seems that works with real

635
00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:01,440
infrastructure I suppose that more

636
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:05,490
convenient to use VMware but if you like

637
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,140
need to use FreeBSD how you can raise it

638
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,140
on docker for instance so

639
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:24,930
yeah thank you yes the last one

640
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:31,940
how can you Emily to the layer 2 network

641
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:33,379
attacks such as a roofing etc I'm asking

642
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:38,670
[Music]

643
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:46,920
because which all switches works not

644
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:50,760
like which they don't have we can

645
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,130
implement also the switches as virtual

646
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,720
boxes for instance if you like to

647
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,880
emulate these kind of attacks and

648
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,310
develop scenarios containing the

649
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,410
spoofing we can use the real toll not

650
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:20,029
will not with all switches but the

651
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:25,490
images of real switches like this thanks

652
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:25,490
thank you right thank you again guys
