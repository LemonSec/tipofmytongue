1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:08,010
okay thank you

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:11,550
I've put a few buzzwords in my my slide

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,088
title thank you all to be attracted to

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:19,170
that let's first start with a few

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,939
mandatory slides you do see myself my

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,609
name is kundunese I'm security

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,210
operations manager at CEA I've also put

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,619
my complex details if you have any

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,759
questions afterwards that could not be

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,710
answered just let me know yeah

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,960
introducing silica but I'm not going too

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,079
much into detail we are an IT service

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,850
provider that means that we also deliver

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:48,030
security services and that's a bit of

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,620
calm the context that we are looking at

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:55,320
in this presentation another few more

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,419
words about the context just to make

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,989
sure that the title didn't distract you

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,320
too much we will not really talk about

20
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,658
latest machine learning techniques this

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,539
will also not be a vendor presentation

22
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,380
about the newest and fanciest AI

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,350
features but what it is supposed to be

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,330
or what I'll try it to be is just some

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,119
ideas on how a standard security

26
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,220
operations center is evolving lately

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,350
more evolved evolving towards DevOps and

28
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,539
then specifically how you are we will

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,929
tackle that from a cultural point of

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:40,049
view because the challenges and so on we

31
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:43,079
see that it's increasing a lot yeah I

32
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,450
base myself not only on my experience

33
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,979
but also on what literature's literature

34
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,890
says I've just formed there a few quotes

35
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:54,780
the last one maybe is interesting if you

36
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,930
make a decision as a human it's always

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,049
with a certain bias while a machine

38
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,430
decision should be more accurate this is

39
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,210
a bit controversial because in

40
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:10,920
cybersecurity that makes total sense but

41
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:13,540
for example with automatic cars that's a

42
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:17,140
bit bit harder you know the

43
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,590
classic dilemma if you have to choose

44
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,929
between hitting moderate child or a tree

45
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,989
that's different of course but on a

46
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,159
purely technical level like security it

47
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,650
makes perfect sense

48
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:34,659
and the last growth is from something

49
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:38,560
that maybe makes at all more obvious if

50
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:40,120
you're lazy engineer has to do a certain

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,370
thing twice manually

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,010
I should have automated it and I think

53
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:48,190
that should be more and more on the back

54
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:51,578
of our minds if if it is not there

55
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:54,010
already now there are different ways to

56
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:58,780
represent how a security operations

57
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:01,899
center evolves I choose it to do it here

58
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,170
is with the amount of data over time but

59
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:08,319
there are different other approaches but

60
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:12,220
what I see is that when I started in the

61
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,560
security that was ten years ago it was

62
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:19,629
very much function driven with that I

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:25,389
mean and network engineer what some

64
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:27,510
security interest looks at his job for

65
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:30,489
more security point of view looking at

66
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,280
what his firewalls are doing and so on

67
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:36,540
it was something more optional let's say

68
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:42,970
and then more and more it become a

69
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:47,590
kekkai compliance driven activity

70
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:50,889
izo bika became more and more thing and

71
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,169
it drove security to raise a little bit

72
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:56,859
in maturity and with that also the

73
00:03:53,169 --> 00:04:00,609
amount of data also increases then

74
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:02,859
management concerns grow grows and

75
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:05,889
typically that is triggered by security

76
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:11,440
incidents or just global awareness that

77
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:12,909
then increases and while we are growing

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,400
maturity while we have more and more

79
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:18,219
data it is also becoming more an

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:23,050
improvement with an activity always

81
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:26,260
adding new data correlating enriching

82
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,400
connecting multiple sources and we are I

83
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,460
think more and more

84
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,710
looking at the data-driven approach for

85
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,710
every security professional every

86
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,258
security engineer every security analyst

87
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,340
in the census a data scientist

88
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:44,949
everything is data in security

89
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,000
operations and that is a bit the

90
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:52,750
background of what I'm trying to what my

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,750
message is this is also also a classic

92
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:58,330
approach an IT but also in a shock

93
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,850
you should the idea behind that is that

94
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:05,740
you should spend as much effort

95
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:09,100
resources money on the three aspects

96
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,789
people technology and processes I'm not

97
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:15,970
saying that is that that it's outdated

98
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:19,510
it will always be something that we have

99
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,460
to strive to but what I believe that the

100
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:27,330
shock is more and more involved into is

101
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:30,280
is this automation and intelligence

102
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:33,210
should be more in the DNA of a security

103
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:39,159
operations center and I made a bubble

104
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:42,039
people bigger with with some intention

105
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,780
because it's classic that people are

106
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:48,219
getting freight to lose their job

107
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:50,320
because things get automated because the

108
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,199
robots are taking over our jobs

109
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,620
I believe that's not true I believe that

110
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:01,620
to make the whole concept of success the

111
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:04,510
people are even more crucial you have to

112
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,370
make the automation and intelligence

113
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,430
work you have to have the wide skills

114
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,669
the right resources and that makes the

115
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,490
people even more important and that

116
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:20,260
means also that we have a demand for new

117
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:22,810
skills to achieve that this is not

118
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:26,110
shocking ideas but scripting skills for

119
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:29,919
security operations engineer is a must

120
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:33,909
and I would specifically mention Titan

121
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:37,389
also not a surprise I guess but Parton

122
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:40,550
also has a very broad range of libraries

123
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:44,060
to deal with machine learning artificial

124
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:47,180
which makes it the barrier to start with

125
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,940
it pretty low and actually eventually

126
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:54,650
everyone with some scripting talents can

127
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:57,740
start with it well a security engineer

128
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:00,140
or analyst up till recently I think was

129
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:04,130
very much focused on response in dealing

130
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:08,630
with rules fine tuning mostly the output

131
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,820
of a sink solution I think it's it's

132
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,010
important that they take care of all the

133
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,409
components also data ingestion

134
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,289
enrichment and seeing that all the

135
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,120
components that you build in a seam

136
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,330
operate at all times so that your

137
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:28,280
automation and your intelligence is

138
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:31,820
always working as you expect and most of

139
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,809
all don't look at security as a very

140
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:39,320
narrow thing but also look at techniques

141
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:42,380
and trends that go beyond the comfort

142
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:47,450
zone and now I specifically mean DevOps

143
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:51,200
like techniques so now a few words on

144
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,860
how we try to do that at sea Higa so at

145
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,170
all times

146
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,200
seam is central for and we are typically

147
00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:03,260
using Splunk for that but any scene with

148
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:07,219
a decent API should be okay so I'm not

149
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:11,840
going to do promote any seam or demote

150
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:14,540
and any any else next to that Jenkins is

151
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,150
also important to automate your job

152
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:23,840
scheduling to start processes to

153
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:26,479
automate what you are trying to do in

154
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,489
terms of intelligence selenium and

155
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,730
that's specifically where DevOps

156
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,740
like features come into place is to

157
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,620
check what's happening and on the front

158
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,020
end of your scene you build reports you

159
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,539
build dashboards it's common practice in

160
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:45,020
the stock but it should operate at all

161
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:50,780
times and lastly it's Jupiter notebooks

162
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:53,120
as I said scripting is crucial and I'm

163
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,779
I've become a real fan of Jupiter

164
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,750
because

165
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:58,880
it brings that something extra let me

166
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,279
explain why

167
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,290
Jupiter is a is actually a computing

168
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,410
interactive computing environment

169
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,410
it supports multiple languages but again

170
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:13,089
I would recommend starting with Python

171
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:17,899
and it makes your scripting and your

172
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:19,850
development very visual especially if

173
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:21,290
you go to machine learning it's very

174
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,500
important that what you're doing

175
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,930
learning techniques and so on it's

176
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,649
always visual so that you have an idea

177
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,199
of what your job is doing actually and

178
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:35,870
Jupiter which is really perfect for that

179
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:38,959
and that makes actually your scripts a

180
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:44,449
human readable and understandable data

181
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:48,109
analyzes becomes very visual and that's

182
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:52,160
the architecture so again of course

183
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:56,930
seamless central Jenkins is also

184
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:00,889
important to start multiple jobs through

185
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:04,008
selenium versus in itself or to Jupiter

186
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:07,730
to execute code versus seem to collect

187
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:11,540
data and to publish it to reports give

188
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:15,350
extra insights and specifically machine

189
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:18,680
learning models and it's important there

190
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:21,769
is always a cycle and that you use the

191
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,930
output of Jupiter report or Jupiter

192
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:26,389
notebook to improve what you're doing in

193
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:31,069
C because I strongly believe if you

194
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:37,639
stick to the same front end that cycle

195
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:40,849
is not always good enough and I'm going

196
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:44,120
to focus on three aspects I could have

197
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:49,720
added multiple more but I selected the

198
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:52,610
tree that are more the most obvious ones

199
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,620
so how could you use this architecture

200
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,740
to improve what you're doing in a sock

201
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,149
well you could use it to visualize what

202
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,649
you're doing a little bit more to

203
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:04,610
validate what you're doing and also

204
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:07,220
detection and then I'm talking about

205
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:12,860
machine learning and I will go over them

206
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:15,680
one by one so what's the challenge when

207
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,220
we try to visualize things as a sock is

208
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,550
the fact that today's logs are huge in

209
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:26,630
amount and increasing every day also the

210
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,819
complexity is increasing because you

211
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:32,209
won't enrich one data source with the

212
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:34,399
other there are dependencies you can do

213
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:36,529
that with see mama I'm totally aware of

214
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:41,529
that but the visualizations sometimes

215
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:48,110
it's limited also in a sock there is

216
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:51,110
always some job path the shop cycle and

217
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,809
for junior analyst it's a lot easier to

218
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:57,459
understand what the sock is doing what

219
00:11:53,809 --> 00:12:01,189
the operation is if that's visual

220
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:03,258
drawing is what it's worth more than a

221
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:05,719
thousand words to say but the graph is

222
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:08,750
worth more than a thousand blocks that's

223
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:13,880
a bit div and to give you an example

224
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:14,600
this is to the left a list of system

225
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,240
locks

226
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,170
see small is actually a sysinternals two

227
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,240
of so maintained by Microsoft that

228
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,540
actually enriches your windows event

229
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,949
logs and what it typically in this

230
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:33,680
example does is looking at process

231
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:39,079
installations and also registry edits

232
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:41,029
and it's typically pretty hard to make

233
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:43,939
it visual how the process tree looks

234
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:48,139
like in the same solution I know there

235
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:50,509
are other tools which can achieve

236
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:53,870
similar things but in Jupiter it makes

237
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:55,880
it a lot more easier because you see the

238
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,079
code you can enrich on the fly and see

239
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,120
the effect immediately

240
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,620
so now why this how that could look like

241
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:07,250
in Jupiter you see different processes

242
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:10,399
the first process starting a the second

243
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:14,179
one which is then changing registry

244
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,640
which is of interest for us and this is

245
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:19,649
an example another example that we used

246
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,410
for example is to investigate

247
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:26,040
phishing attacks so then you start with

248
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:28,290
a log file a email gateway or your

249
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:33,599
exchange logs and then you can determine

250
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:38,329
who receive the certain phishing email

251
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:41,369
and you can enrich that with browsing

252
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:44,790
log sources and see who actually clicked

253
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:46,800
a certain link and who actually ran a

254
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:50,248
code and if you combine that in a

255
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:54,029
process tree you have very fast an idea

256
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:57,480
of who trapped into a phishing attack

257
00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:00,209
and that's a bit the idea of true

258
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:04,769
Paterno book that can be reused and can

259
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:10,079
be adapted easily if you have small

260
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:13,949
changes in your attack scenario then

261
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,929
validation I think and that's nothing

262
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:18,420
new if you build dashboards if you'd

263
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:25,170
build correlation searches even though

264
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:30,120
even if you use directly from from a

265
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:32,790
library that the CIMA shows or provides

266
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,449
you always want to make sure that it is

267
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:39,029
operating at all times all components of

268
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:41,248
the same should actually be validated

269
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,990
continuously and I'm going to point at

270
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:45,120
two examples

271
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,069
you had need to validate the correctness

272
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:54,540
of your dashboards but also of your

273
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:56,519
correlation searches so first of all you

274
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,800
want to validate your scenario your

275
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,499
correlation search what you actually

276
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,969
want to do is you have a list of

277
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:09,689
predefined events and you do all this

278
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:12,149
actually through the same API you get

279
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:15,629
the the correlation search through the

280
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:18,329
API and you check if the predefined

281
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:21,569
events and the correlation search have

282
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:25,529
the expected output so for example here

283
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:30,299
in the left below you see that we have

284
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:32,329
certain common line processes to events

285
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:36,980
the correlation search looks

286
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:39,888
for specific encoded comment parameter

287
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,829
so if the correlation search works it

288
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:44,959
gives one event as output if something

289
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:47,748
breaks in the correlation search or

290
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,649
whatever because that's a dynamic thing

291
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:55,670
then this this test which you can do

292
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:59,179
through Jenkins would not provide that

293
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,660
one event as output and you can conclude

294
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:06,679
that your correlation search is broken

295
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:09,829
it happens more happens a lot that such

296
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,779
a situation where correlations search is

297
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:13,790
broken it's only discovered of after

298
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:16,459
days or weeks and that's of course

299
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,920
situation that you do not want so

300
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:22,248
typically you can run this job every

301
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:25,219
hour and see if someone by accident or

302
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:29,989
for whatever reason breaks something

303
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:32,449
that has an operational impact the

304
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:35,209
second example is to validate your

305
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:37,579
dashboard or your report you build

306
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:40,099
reports that are needed to do track

307
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:43,988
hunting or to report to management or

308
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:47,439
whatever and for that we use selenium

309
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:51,709
which is actually a framework to

310
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:54,139
automate all your web browser tests so

311
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:56,868
if someone breaks something in that

312
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,410
dashboard and again that's mostly human

313
00:16:56,869 --> 00:16:59,629
error

314
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:05,119
but could also be that for some reason

315
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:07,519
there are no events anymore visible then

316
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,379
selenium is able to detect that just

317
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,079
simply by it's not very obvious but

318
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:16,610
simply by looking at any error messages

319
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,888
on a on a dashboard base page and how

320
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:23,839
that typically works is that it's just a

321
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:27,408
piece of Python code you in the first

322
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,100
step you just get this blank URL you do

323
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:33,139
the authentication in the second part

324
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:37,158
and then you just load the dashboard

325
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:39,049
that you want to check and if you wait a

326
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:41,049
little bit because typically there are

327
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:43,668
some dashboards that takes some time and

328
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:46,379
then you assert if the dashboard was

329
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:51,060
loaded without any arrows being a

330
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:53,310
it out in in the browser in the in the

331
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,169
session that it's very simple that's

332
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:59,220
something that in the DevOps is

333
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,290
happening all the time but what I think

334
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:06,890
is that you use it should use it in a

335
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,889
stock more to improve efficiency and

336
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:15,300
then detection the idea behind that is

337
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:19,920
that the standard correlation rules are

338
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:23,570
typically outdated it's always a quest

339
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:26,600
for what is now the perfect threshold

340
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:29,550
you have to change at every time and

341
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:34,199
situations change environment change

342
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:36,480
it's just not at all efficient so there

343
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,120
is always a need and need to talk

344
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,460
directly with a we'd seen through an API

345
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,820
because you want to put this kind of

346
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:48,990
intelligence outside of it I'll explain

347
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,850
you why you have to design models you

348
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,640
have to setup your own machine learning

349
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:58,110
scenarios most seam solutions already

350
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,750
have a machine learning capability that

351
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:04,709
that's not loading very well sorry for

352
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:07,230
that but you have no real insight in how

353
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,180
the training process is actually

354
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:14,090
happening

355
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:20,760
you just set up the machine learning job

356
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:22,560
you have it sets up a standard model but

357
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,310
what happens on the background it's not

358
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,379
not very visible therefore you also

359
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:32,040
don't know if it's doing actually what

360
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,470
you wanted to do it also is limited in

361
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,370
terms of available models in terms of

362
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:42,660
model parameters that you can use to do

363
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:45,360
your job it's also very difficult to

364
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:50,100
combine different models and especially

365
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,689
that is very helpful basically the

366
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,629
conclusion is that if you look at

367
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,730
standards seem technology the automated

368
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,720
learning what the machine learning is

369
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:02,230
still under development and I believe

370
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,299
that's not ready yet maybe that's a bit

371
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,429
controversial because it's mostly from

372
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:07,120
our experience that we make this

373
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,429
conclusion

374
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,840
maybe there are other vendors that are

375
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:18,330
better but I believe there are still

376
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,330
something to say of doing it outside see

377
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:24,820
let's take a very simple example just a

378
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,630
vertical port scan that's one IP which

379
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:31,120
scans multiple ports and one host that's

380
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:34,000
a standard thing that should trigger

381
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,939
something in a sock and if you look at

382
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,780
the standard way of dealing with that

383
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:45,340
and then we set up a certain threshold

384
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:48,668
if 200 ports are scanned from one source

385
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,139
IP to one destination IP then it could

386
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:54,340
trigger something or any other

387
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:56,380
thresholds it's just an example but the

388
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,928
thing is that you can bypass that very

389
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:02,289
easily if you do it on a slow scope or

390
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:04,960
if you stay on the radar just just

391
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:07,780
enough most of all it's a lot of false

392
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,600
positives because yeah some IP is just

393
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,149
for some reason do this kind of things

394
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,980
on the network and it takes a lot of

395
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:19,120
time to actually improve your

396
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,090
correlation search with some

397
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,389
whitelisting etc to deal with that it's

398
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:28,480
just not efficient and if you do that

399
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:31,210
with machine learning and the clue is

400
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,480
actually to combine two machine learning

401
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:36,520
techniques is to first of all create

402
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,390
profiles and you do that with a

403
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,490
technique called game means clustering

404
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:46,230
then you group IPs that have a similar

405
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:49,590
behavior in one cluster in one group and

406
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:52,539
the second job would be to use a dynamic

407
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:55,178
threshold and but you can do that then

408
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:57,460
for each profile so if you have a group

409
00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:00,280
of IPS that are just very noisy on the

410
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:04,240
network that group would have a

411
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:07,649
different threshold than a group that of

412
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,390
IPS that are typically for example

413
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:11,590
workstations are pretty silent when it

414
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,929
comes to

415
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:17,678
looking at multiple ports in one I pee

416
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:20,649
and yeah with Gaussian anomaly detection

417
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,879
you have then you can create you can

418
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:26,258
detect an anomaly if it goes a certain

419
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:29,289
deviation away from the from the mean

420
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:32,620
value of that cluster and especially

421
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:35,919
that combination the clustering and the

422
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:39,189
anomaly detection that's what no seem I

423
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:43,749
can do in a very efficient way and where

424
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:45,820
you can use frameworks like Jupiter most

425
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:47,889
of all the nice effect is that the

426
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:51,570
number of false positives and we can

427
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:54,729
actually confirm that is a lot lower and

428
00:22:51,570 --> 00:23:00,908
once you set that up it's very easy to

429
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:03,249
maintain so if you set up gay means

430
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:06,220
clustering with 10 profiles you have 10

431
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:11,110
groups you have 10 dynamic thresholds

432
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:15,399
because it learns and at and it defines

433
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:17,320
different thresholds all the time and as

434
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:20,830
I said if you want to do that inseam you

435
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:24,279
have to have these different jobs and a

436
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:27,610
different machine learning two jobs and

437
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:30,700
see you have to combine them it's very

438
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:33,699
cumbersome it's very hard to maintain so

439
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:39,190
I would go for the architecture on the

440
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:41,980
right and speak with API in scene do

441
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,440
your machine learning and produce

442
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,720
results back to seam so that you can

443
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,909
respond to it just like with any other

444
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:54,700
scenario then it's a time for a

445
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:58,960
conclusion it was my idea to give some

446
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:01,090
things to think of because I believe we

447
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,529
always should expand our mind and our

448
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:09,059
scope and a way of working I believe

449
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:12,639
that the the threat landscape and what

450
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:16,029
customers and what we expect from sock

451
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:19,258
ourselves demands more and more for

452
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:23,889
higher and different focus it's not only

453
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:25,240
events in alerts out response we have to

454
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:28,780
always look at

455
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,510
our efficiency so repeating tasks need

456
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:34,930
to be automated cannot stress that

457
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:37,150
enough its scripting and automating is a

458
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:42,180
standard skill for any security

459
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:46,990
professional also the quality should

460
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:51,160
always be evaluated the the things that

461
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:54,970
I showed around validation it's just two

462
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:58,600
examples but you can use these

463
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:01,390
techniques for different components in

464
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,189
your sock and most of all machine

465
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,550
learning it's a buzzword I'm very well

466
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:10,180
aware of that but I believe that this

467
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:13,240
that's the next logical step in

468
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,110
improving ourselves the threshold let's

469
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,540
forget about that

470
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:21,310
let's go for advanced detection

471
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:23,830
scenarios and to conclude finally it's I

472
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:28,320
believe that the DEF typical DevOps

473
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:32,429
qualities and skills become a very

474
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:39,250
important part of Sox engineers toolset

475
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:41,770
so yeah we what what we should do is

476
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:44,200
always expand our skill set and our

477
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:48,490
scope and think about what typically

478
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,810
typically is done and DevOps that's it

479
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,810
actually thank you

480
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:02,000
so thank you so much for the for dope

481
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,160
also presentation I think we have we

482
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,460
definitely have time for a few questions

483
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:11,270
so let's get it started yes we see you a

484
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:14,420
mic is coming to you to your right

485
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:17,150
so should I stand yeah so first of all

486
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:20,150
congrats for the presentation questions

487
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,470
I agree with the I fully agree with the

488
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,960
statement that you had in one of your

489
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,850
slides regarding like if you're doing

490
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,040
something manually twice then you should

491
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,980
definitely think to automate but my

492
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:34,970
question for you is like how could you

493
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:37,790
enforce having soc for a product which

494
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,770
is currently in development so what is

495
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,170
that it's kind of tricky to implement

496
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,150
when you're actually developing

497
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,210
something obviously if the product is

498
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,500
much mature enough you can think about

499
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,900
automating something like having a good

500
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,800
architecture as you said but like if the

501
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,130
product is in a continuously changing

502
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,350
stare away

503
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:59,210
I don't know environment for example you

504
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,120
mention about selenium right so if you

505
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,190
are thinking about website or something

506
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,439
well platform right so you have all

507
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,380
these components which in a development

508
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,420
phase might change a lot so in that case

509
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,580
automation not necessarily makes sense

510
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,429
like all the time so it's kind of tricky

511
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,199
to automate not to mention machine

512
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:21,260
learning if you're having a quite

513
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,150
dynamic I don't know environment you

514
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,250
know so how would you approach that I

515
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,740
mean it as you as we all know in the

516
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:30,800
software development lifecycle it's much

517
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,110
more effective to apply stuff to solve

518
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,030
stop in an initial phase so not after

519
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:38,360
you release it from different kind of

520
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:42,530
point of views I completely agree that's

521
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:44,178
pretty tricky but I kind of cannot say I

522
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,010
have the exact answer for that but if

523
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:48,590
you are in the development process and

524
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:51,190
already think about automation

525
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:54,949
techniques and responsibilities or

526
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:58,610
automation opportunities in that face I

527
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:02,240
believe whenever you execute it it's

528
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:04,309
always interesting so my advice would be

529
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,890
to do it as fast as possible and

530
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:09,799
typically these these things that are

531
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,929
proposed you can reuse parts of

532
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:15,520
another situation so if you have a

533
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:19,820
standard set of automation and dual sets

534
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:23,570
then it should say shoot it should go

535
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,908
easier but it's difficult I agree so

536
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,480
overall basically you can apply all of

537
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:30,559
this when the product is mature enough

538
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,890
but then it's the risk of not having

539
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,889
security in an initial point of the

540
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:39,649
product right security of course is

541
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:45,350
always the number one priority it is but

542
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:47,389
but it's it's the balance that you have

543
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,699
to look between a delivering a secure

544
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,130
product and a product that also operates

545
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,740
tomorrow and next week and next year and

546
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:56,659
I think what you should do is during

547
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,779
development already work on that and

548
00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:02,360
look for the white balance that fits

549
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:05,029
with the expectations of the customer ok

550
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,649
thank you very much the next question I

551
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:09,710
know we have several there so if you

552
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:11,750
could yes thank you so I put thanks to

553
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,149
the presentation I have actually two

554
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,370
questions so one of them is what you

555
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:18,678
insure or what how can you make

556
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:21,709
assurance that your integrity is not

557
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,169
altered while correlating logs so that's

558
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,669
one of the things because you're

559
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:29,049
scripting and correlating logs so

560
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:34,070
whenever you alter the logs there's a

561
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:36,529
risk for that to be corrupted for

562
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,860
tempering and whatever the other thing

563
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:43,000
is what do you think how can you make a

564
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,979
stock for different products so

565
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,010
especially when you have a service

566
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:51,799
product is the same but say for example

567
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:54,649
your company creates does I don't know

568
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:56,379
web design so today it's a web service

569
00:29:54,649 --> 00:30:00,139
for someone tomorrow is going to be

570
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:02,840
meeting at the other day is gonna be

571
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,419
something totally different so how do

572
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:09,770
you imagine that I don't know

573
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:12,529
approaching the center second question

574
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,029
so if the product is not the same so

575
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:16,370
every time it's different

576
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:18,320
your logs are going to be different your

577
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:21,850
problems your alerts they're going to be

578
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,928
talking about the scene actually yes

579
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:28,120
and things yeah okay team goes to be

580
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:30,520
monitoring obviously but that I will

581
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,280
respond to your first question first

582
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,440
integrity is I think always guaranteed

583
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,740
because if you look at my architecture

584
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,250
it's only reading that it does it does

585
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:47,289
not white at any point it just grabs the

586
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:49,539
data yes I think so it's processing it

587
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:52,450
and then you can write to another index

588
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:54,970
or another destination in your seam so

589
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:58,570
that way you can always assure that

590
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:00,520
integrity is not at stake and your

591
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:04,270
second question is pretty relevant to

592
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:07,059
what your colleague asked I think when

593
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:09,460
you are monitoring more and more you

594
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:11,830
should yeah I think think about these

595
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,909
techniques while you're developing while

596
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:17,678
you're onboarding them and reuse as much

597
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:21,100
as possible the code that you already

598
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:24,059
have and that's tricky again but yeah

599
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,010
that's also what's turkey in DevOps

600
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:30,010
superstar thank you thank you next

601
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:32,850
question we have there and then we're

602
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:36,700
going to go on the other side I promise

603
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:40,360
hey so thanks a lot for the for the

604
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:44,950
nicely done presentation and so I have

605
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:49,120
one question and it's mainly regards if

606
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:52,600
you did any attempts to attack the

607
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,320
machine learning models to a mitral

608
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,918
attack framework and if you if you did

609
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,710
it already

610
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:04,110
are you planning to publish it open

611
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:07,900
source or not we did not do it yet and

612
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:11,740
we can think about that it might be

613
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:14,289
interesting for us is also a very recent

614
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:17,740
and very new approaches that we are

615
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:20,710
doing so but I will keep it in mind yes

616
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:24,159
I believe that these attempts will be

617
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:26,530
quite beneficial if basically for

618
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,400
targeting socks with your handling with

619
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:31,720
a really broad and big infrastructures

620
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,260
thank you and if you release it open

621
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,150
source that will be yeah that will be

622
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,470
really great or the whole community

623
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:42,160
thanks for the idea

624
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:44,920
yeah so let's take yes that question

625
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,290
over there um hello so in the beginning

626
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,900
you said the importance of the human

627
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:52,149
aspect in the development what do you

628
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,180
think about testing do you think testing

629
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:57,220
can be fully automated because some

630
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,010
people think that it can be not because

631
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:02,500
testing should be about finding the

632
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:06,940
human intention and that would mean

633
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:09,040
having the perfect AI I think you should

634
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,990
automate it as much as possible but yeah

635
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:16,570
there always be a human intervention to

636
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:19,380
evaluate that process continuously so

637
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:29,980
it's a bit chicken-egg situation I think

638
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:31,890
okay thank you next question the mic is

639
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,780
coming - just keep your hand up please

640
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:37,960
okay we have time for two more so don't

641
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:41,200
worry can you please give us two

642
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,620
concrete examples of other machine

643
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,330
learning things that you could solve I

644
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:53,070
mean you gave us the just the IP

645
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:53,070
scanning example at the top of my head

646
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:01,270
let me get back to that it's typically

647
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:07,630
something that I should address to my

648
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:09,460
engineers the next question or for

649
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,590
example brute-force attempts or so

650
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,870
typically everything that has a fixed

651
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:16,810
threshold this

652
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:21,429
I think the first focus of a machine

653
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:24,730
learning job because that it's just too

654
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:26,590
stupid pardon my french but everything

655
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,830
with a fixed threshold like a brute

656
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:34,620
force or a port scan you should try to

657
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:38,290
look at it in a machine learning rate

658
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:42,339
okay cool taking the next question over

659
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:46,270
there okay thank you for your

660
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:48,909
presentation you've mentioned the

661
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:52,119
possibility of eliminating

662
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:55,299
- defined thresholds and as an

663
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:57,880
alternative you've mentioned k-means

664
00:34:55,299 --> 00:35:05,470
clustering as a means of a supervised

665
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:08,799
learning yes the k-means algorithm has

666
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:12,250
some built-in parameters that you need

667
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:20,700
to define before analyzing the data so

668
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:24,279
instead of defining the 300 open boards

669
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,730
for that threshold you've switched that

670
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:33,569
to the number of clusters in the cannons

671
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:37,740
with with the ten with the tens clusters

672
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:41,740
that was something that you empirically

673
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:47,939
find to provide good results for for

674
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:51,819
that case or you hope to generalize that

675
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:53,980
number of clusters to somehow identify

676
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:56,890
the number of cluster in advance I think

677
00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:00,069
that first step is crucial for reducing

678
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:02,230
the false positives you could stick with

679
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:07,450
only the second machine learning jobs

680
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:10,329
and should just look at what is an

681
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:13,328
anomaly based on on just one group of

682
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:15,099
eyepiece but because in a typically net

683
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:18,609
typical Network there are so many

684
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:20,559
different kind of devices I think you

685
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:24,009
still have too much false positives

686
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:28,660
that's what I think that's also what our

687
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:30,339
tests prove awesome well that's a wrap

688
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,250
for this presentation so thank you so

689
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:35,710
much

690
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,710
