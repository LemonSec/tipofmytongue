1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,650
we designed this presentation together

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,000
with my colleague to show you some of

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,360
the security challenges that you are

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,610
facing in gaming industry but as a

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,730
traditional enterprise but also looking

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:18,330
from the player perspective and from our

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,859
product or game's perspective so all

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,698
right awesome

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,260
hello everyone my name is Rizwan I was

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,150
only actually supposed to do half of

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,970
this presentation but since Mihai lost

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,530
his voice just last night I'm just gonna

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,890
cover it all so let's get into it all

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,600
right

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,480
I'm gonna do the introduction for you to

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,180
save you a bit of health on your voice

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,660
so Mihai is our director for security

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,629
operations here out of EA Romania he

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:53,029
basically manages the whole sock as far

20
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:55,829
as EA global goals so today we wanted to

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,899
present a few of the more unique

22
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,300
security challenges that the gaming

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,879
company has I mean security in general

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,679
is pretty broad and a lot of companies

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,560
regardless of their business actually

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,150
cover various aspects of it right so

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,670
malware is a problem for everyone but

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,549
obviously each industry also has its own

29
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,330
specifics so gonna take two points of

30
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,950
view the first one is from a sock slash

31
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,820
enterprise security level and the other

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:27,090
one is basically where I woops sorry

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:30,179
where I fall in which is the application

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:35,460
security area let's say so getting into

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:38,030
it video games have been growing

36
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,979
tremendously in terms of business a

37
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,790
recent study basically places gaming as

38
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:48,079
the biggest entertainment category

39
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:50,610
globally in terms of revenue profit

40
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,320
articles about the gaming industry some

41
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,340
snippets from Reuters and Forbes the

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,500
Forbes snippet discusses FIFA as you can

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,420
see the discussion was around the fact

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,630
that it generates nearly 800 million

45
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,920
dollars a year just by itself obviously

46
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:10,169
FIFA is one of the titles that we have

47
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,970
in our portfolio and the country so

48
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,589
there is another aspect here that I

49
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,019
thought was really interesting Damon

50
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,230
that China has a 50-point plan to turn

51
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:23,670
the country into a 800 billion dollar

52
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:26,518
sports industry with focus on soccer

53
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,549
so this implicitly means that if China

54
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,470
grow and kind of market soccer inside of

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,870
their own country implicitly FIFA and

56
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,989
other titles that do soccer will grow

57
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,709
with it so compared to television at the

58
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:46,920
time of this study about 11 billion more

59
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:50,040
which is quite significant so what are

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,010
the problems in in essence from the

61
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,970
security perspective a small snippet on

62
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,599
top discusses an interesting case reason

63
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:03,440
that was recently wrapped up an attack

64
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:08,899
against the x-box network by a few

65
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,680
exceptional but misguided young men they

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,360
basically figured out some

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,420
vulnerabilities and we're managing to

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,890
falsely create in-game currency now for

69
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,958
those of you who are unaware you have

70
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,119
various types of currencies that you

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,239
earn by playing the game and you spend

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,590
it for various items within the game so

73
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,630
in this case they found a vulnerability

74
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,239
that allowed them to actually pipe into

75
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,310
a database and just generate value

76
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,470
constantly and then sell it on the black

77
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,280
market because obviously there's also a

78
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,920
black market for in-game consumables any

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,889
type of game you can think of if there's

80
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,328
trading there's gonna be a black market

81
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:52,169
so we are significant targets I think

82
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:54,329
three major types of attackers or

83
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:57,030
motivations behind an attack are the

84
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:59,370
main culprits for us embarrassment

85
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,139
so obviously hey EA has really bad

86
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,160
security or something along the lines is

87
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:07,470
their final goal most of the times

88
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,470
collateral damage from stuff like wanna

89
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,079
cry or other more advanced malware

90
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,620
threats that somehow hop the parameter

91
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,840
into our network and damages as well and

92
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,239
apt style motivations which are direct

93
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,250
financial gain by somehow getting a

94
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,320
foothold inside of the network and being

95
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,340
able to do various things like for

96
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,040
example generate

97
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,760
some coins that you can then trade and

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,630
sell on some sort of black market but

99
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,340
there is one difficulty or one really

100
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,040
important thing that differentiates us

101
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,549
from for example the defense in risky

102
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,889
business or a bank the fact that we need

103
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,690
to keep our environment very dynamic we

104
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:51,270
need to allow developers and content

105
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,790
creators that work for EA to be able to

106
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,159
develop and create new content and

107
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,990
that's not always easy you can't just

108
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,810
lock everything down because then you're

109
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,390
gonna have 10 15 20 incidents a day

110
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,570
where some developer was trying to use

111
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,520
it to plug in something extra apart from

112
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,890
the basic stuff that you whitelist it

113
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,840
and he can't because something is

114
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,169
blocking it you don't want that overhead

115
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,260
when 90% of your company is writing code

116
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:23,310
and developing and building very complex

117
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:25,740
software at the end of the day so in

118
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,490
short since we can't run security like a

119
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:32,150
defense industry business or like a bank

120
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,950
we need to get creative we need to find

121
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,919
innovative solutions let's say to fix

122
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:41,520
some of the problems that other industry

123
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,400
members regularly fix just by enforcing

124
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,990
some really solid walls for example let

125
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,299
me just talk about an interesting case

126
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,580
that we have as a gaming company which

127
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,979
is pretty much uncommon anywhere else

128
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,919
other than a gaming company consoles

129
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:58,289
right ps4 Xbox everybody's familiar with

130
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,880
them but you might not necessarily be

131
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,349
familiar with the development process

132
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,180
that you must go through to actually

133
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,320
build and release a game on one of these

134
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,570
consoles now some of you may know next

135
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,820
year 2020 is the release of the new

136
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,960
generation of consoles the PlayStation 5

137
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,919
and the new Xbox console and obviously

138
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,890
being EA

139
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,419
is partners with Sony and Microsoft X

140
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,640
because we release games on these

141
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,370
platforms so they kind of have to

142
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,409
prepare us in advance hey this is the

143
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,330
new console you want to start building

144
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,979
your title for it probably a year

145
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,690
year-and-a-half in advance of when it

146
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,370
actually launches so that when the

147
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,419
console hits the market you actually

148
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,020
have something to run on it and

149
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,818
quote-unquote explore

150
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,090
all of the hardware goodness that's

151
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:47,039
contained in the new generation right so

152
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,150
we receive what are known as difficut

153
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,830
these are consoles that those ones so

154
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,628
they replicate the hardware one to one

155
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,750
it's exactly the same thing that you

156
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,970
would get in the commercial version only

157
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:02,490
packaged in a generic case because the

158
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,139
designs are not finalized and running

159
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,759
software that gets updated frequently

160
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,409
but that allows you to start your

161
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,409
development process and to start working

162
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:12,810
on it these are a big problem from a

163
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:15,000
security perspective first of all on the

164
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,520
black market they're like hot hot stuff

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,639
because they lack certain protections

166
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,650
and they offer developers special kinds

167
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,840
of access inside like towards the

168
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:28,530
innards of them so basically let's say

169
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,929
to the ring three level at most and

170
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,388
potentially even ring 0 depending on

171
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:36,690
what kind of development you're doing

172
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:38,759
they have a web interface where you can

173
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,440
like run some scripts get Diagnostics

174
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,840
remote accessing and a bunch of other

175
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,490
stuff now because they are deaf kids

176
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,380
they're fully configurable so that you

177
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,259
can test various configurations make

178
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:52,199
sure everything works well and that

179
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,819
means that as a workstation they live

180
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,529
inside of your network so they're just

181
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:57,419
like any other laptop any other computer

182
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:59,759
that you might be running now we have a

183
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,380
bunch of these obviously we have a lot

184
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,130
of developers we need a bunch of

185
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,779
difficut so a special challenge is not

186
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,699
only securing them against the theft

187
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,009
that can be done right secure

188
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,680
transporting locking down your building

189
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,909
probe appropriately sensible dev kits

190
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,300
should be locked when

191
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:22,380
office hours are up over and such but as

192
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:25,880
a as a device on the network they can be

193
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,889
completely exposed and a few of the

194
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,889
critical things you can't run an AV on

195
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:34,339
them it's true Xbox runs a flavor of

196
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:37,500
Windows 10 the PlayStation runs a

197
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:39,990
customized flavor of a UNIX based system

198
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,179
but you can't just get some anti-malware

199
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,890
engine of the web install it and hey I'm

200
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,239
good to go any file that might be

201
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,430
suspicious will get scanned

202
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,529
because it they just don't work there's

203
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,229
nothing you can purchase off the market

204
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,670
either like a third party solution you

205
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,040
don't have any sort of video

206
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:59,729
you can't install any type of agents any

207
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,800
type of small tool that will track or

208
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,360
report or scan or anything like that

209
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,599
so that's out of the question as well

210
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,210
and they don't have any sort of

211
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,210
possibility for remote lockdowns

212
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:14,610
or joining domains and getting policies

213
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,650
from your domain which again means that

214
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:20,040
basically they're just on the network

215
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,840
accessible and unless you do specific

216
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,000
stuff to lock them down they're going to

217
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,730
be open systems that can be used for

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,890
pivoting inside of the network so for

219
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,680
example what we've been doing to fix

220
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:34,290
this I'm not sure about other gaming

221
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,229
industry members but our solution was to

222
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:40,620
do it custom so we have a custom-built

223
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:43,040
solution that basically navigates the

224
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,640
network tries to find dev kits and

225
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,740
exploit them so it has a

226
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,990
proof-of-concept exploit it tries to run

227
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,620
a script and get a return value from

228
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,770
that nothing too fancy the fancier part

229
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,720
of it is that it also attempts to lock

230
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,430
down the dev kit so once it's found it

231
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,960
and confirmed that it's exploitable and

232
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,000
you can actually use it as a pivot point

233
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,180
inside of the network once you've gained

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,460
perimeter access it basically pushes a

235
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,709
configuration set to the actual console

236
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,530
that locks it down set an administrator

237
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,960
password and if I'm not mistaken the

238
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,790
latest feature is that it emails the

239
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,440
administrator so the administrator

240
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,540
account that logged into the console

241
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,520
last hey we changed their password to

242
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,550
reach out to us so we can get it

243
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,590
unlocked other than that the only

244
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,020
solution that we actually came up with

245
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,540
was to do network segmentation so trying

246
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,660
to isolate all of the dev kits from

247
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,280
everything else both ways so that's a

248
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,160
bit challenging again we need to be

249
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,130
dynamic we have a super vast development

250
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,250
environment all kinds of tools build

251
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,650
pipelines everything you can imagine so

252
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,260
doing the segmentation is a bit tricky

253
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,569
we've been working it out pretty well so

254
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,300
far but it's not really a hundred

255
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,940
percent set in stone right now it's very

256
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,740
promising though so this is something I

257
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,360
mentioned initially that we're going to

258
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,520
talk about stuff that's a bit more

259
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,889
unique to the gaming industry consoles

260
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,290
on the network are one of these consoles

261
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:12,149
durations and companies that build stuff

262
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,509
for consoles really need to make sure

263
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,999
that if they use dev kits they are not

264
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:21,989
leveraged as pivot points within their

265
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:23,939
network itself all right this was

266
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:28,609
supposed to be my introduction slide so

267
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:28,608
this is where I slide in one more time

268
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:34,169
so a bit about me then if we're at this

269
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:38,189
point I'm the tech lead for the security

270
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:40,709
engineering team at EA the full name and

271
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:42,748
that was a poor choice of color on my

272
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:44,128
behalf the full name of my department is

273
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:46,079
the game and platform security

274
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:49,470
engineering team so basically our

275
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:53,099
responsibility is games and all the

276
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,019
services that support the games and the

277
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,939
platforms themselves so this means

278
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:01,049
Nintendo switch yes

279
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:04,199
PlayStation Xbox PC mobile phones

280
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:05,459
Android and iOS obviously so anything

281
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:07,529
that deals with this is our

282
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:10,410
responsibility in terms of ensuring that

283
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:11,999
the products that we release and the

284
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,949
platforms that we release them on are

285
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:18,749
secure so it's not just web applications

286
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:21,829
obviously games are complex software

287
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:24,660
thick clients are generally C++ and

288
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:26,939
other low-level languages you need speed

289
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,279
you want 60 frames per second and 60

290
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:31,349
Hertz communication with the server so

291
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,989
you need a programming language that's

292
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,439
low-level and can run fast you have 300

293
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:39,269
libraries being loaded and graphics

294
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:44,069
engines and physics engines and all of

295
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:45,869
that so we do pen tests on all of the

296
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:47,998
applications that are produced within

297
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:49,919
the company we do source code reviews

298
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,220
right checking for all of the generic

299
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,139
stuff buffer overflows and whatnot on

300
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:58,079
top of that as I mentioned previously

301
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,939
there's the aspect of consoles right so

302
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,368
how do you develop and how do you do

303
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:04,410
source code review for an application

304
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:07,619
that's meant to run on a Playstation on

305
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,299
our next box one console generally it's

306
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:10,980
pretty similar I mean you're still

307
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:13,858
looking for exactly the same type of

308
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,959
vulnerability exploitation becomes a bit

309
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,639
more complicated whereas on PC it's

310
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,169
pretty straightforward you have

311
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,390
documentation there's been so many

312
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:23,970
exploits and aslr and all of that

313
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:26,790
you can bypass etc consoles are locked

314
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:30,330
down documentation is available for us

315
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:33,030
as a collaborator of their sorry of

316
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,920
their platforms but they don't go into

317
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,170
so much technical detail that you can be

318
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,180
a hundred percent sure that hey I found

319
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,760
the vulnerability but it's not

320
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,530
exploitable because the hardware in

321
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,930
itself is locked down in such a way that

322
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:49,530
it won't allow exploitation or maybe I

323
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:51,000
can even set execution on a memory page

324
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,839
that I'm in right now

325
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,540
etc and the latest thing which we

326
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,030
actually debuted pretty recently cloud

327
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,610
gaming so the concept pretty simple you

328
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:06,449
have a very thin client running on your

329
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:08,310
machine technically right now that is

330
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:11,060
not the case but technically it could be

331
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,589
as simple as a TV right or smart TV and

332
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,880
everything is run on the server what you

333
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:20,250
get is streamed video and what you send

334
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,810
back is our streamed inputs so basically

335
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,680
anything you input from your controller

336
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:27,959
directly just gets piped into the server

337
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,849
now this is a new technology space for

338
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,100
us I know other industries are very

339
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:34,080
mature in the cloud side we also have

340
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,630
cloud infrastructure and manage it but

341
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,970
this concept of dynamic streaming

342
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,990
constantly is something new and it opens

343
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:45,650
up a new sector of vulnerabilities that

344
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:48,060
we were previously not accustomed to

345
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:51,329
fortunately we have it on the rep so we

346
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,130
we did figure it out and we had gigantic

347
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,200
architecture reviews and security

348
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,790
reviews but it is a new class of

349
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,650
vulnerability so it's something special

350
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,349
that we're on the lookout each time we

351
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:04,670
do each time our developers do something

352
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,670
new for the clone environment

353
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:11,849
anti-piracy alright so I mentioned game

354
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,380
and platforms obviously since I'm we're

355
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,840
responsible for the games as well as the

356
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,210
platform's they run on anti-piracy is

357
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,980
also something that we are concerned

358
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:24,780
with the three major aspects of

359
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,460
anti-piracy diminishing returns

360
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,310
everything will get cracked period

361
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,260
there's no debate about it took me two

362
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,270
years and a half to convince people at

363
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,990
EA that there is no uncrackable there's

364
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,750
no anti pamper solution that will

365
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:41,380
just fix it and you're gonna be able to

366
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,970
not have a cracked game for 50 years or

367
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,399
something like that so it's all about

368
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,830
the diminishing returns minimize

369
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,860
performance impact and the temper tends

370
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:53,110
to be quite performance intensive and

371
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,089
when you're talking response times of

372
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:59,290
two milliseconds and 60 frames per

373
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:01,270
second it can get a bit tricky minimize

374
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,480
player annoyance at the same time so you

375
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,380
want it to run everywhere if somebody

376
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,060
reinstalls the game on a different

377
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,770
configuration it also has to run

378
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,750
appropriately licensing checks

379
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:14,800
everything has to flow without any

380
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:17,649
friction to players and maximize time on

381
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,240
market so once it's been cracked the

382
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,550
revenue that you get from a title will

383
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,070
probably decrease so the idea is to have

384
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:27,729
as much time from launch as possible

385
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:30,610
until it will eventually get cracked the

386
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,440
anti temper in itself is a complicated

387
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,510
discussion for gaming companies and I'm

388
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,720
sure for other companies as well but

389
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:41,980
this is my area of specialty gaming in

390
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,680
itself so we at EA had a very long

391
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,660
debate in which we weighed the pros and

392
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,670
cons of building our own anti-tamper

393
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,560
versus purchasing the third-party

394
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,540
anti-tamper of the market so some

395
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,920
something like the nouveau or arcs and

396
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:58,750
VM protect stuff like that now today we

397
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,630
still use a third party component

398
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,089
developing an anti tamper is no easy

399
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,800
business you need quite the team to

400
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,839
actually get something that you can

401
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,059
trust for more than three hours after

402
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,480
you launch the game so we're still going

403
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:15,428
for third party stuff we've had a very

404
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,679
good collaboration with the nouveau in

405
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:20,110
our case they have a very interesting

406
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,240
solution but for us maybe other

407
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,760
companies disagree but for us going

408
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,380
third party is still the best choice

409
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,600
today and finally one of one important

410
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,820
thing regardless of which method we are

411
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,830
approached one of one important thing

412
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,990
for us was to be tuned in so that means

413
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,419
tracking latest developments making sure

414
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,460
we know when a crack is released making

415
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,230
sure we measure what kind of average

416
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,100
time we get between the release of the

417
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,330
game and the day that it was cracked

418
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,330
it's just another form of

419
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,220
hunting a very basic one that's true but

420
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,139
it's just scouring the web and all of

421
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,509
the common resources and the more

422
00:17:56,139 --> 00:18:00,399
uncommon resources like forums discord

423
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:02,440
channel stuff like that to get

424
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:10,719
information as soon as it becomes

425
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:14,499
available and finally one more topic and

426
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,200
this is really really getting into

427
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:20,220
really specific gaming problems now anti

428
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,989
cheating or the problem of ensuring that

429
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,389
everyone has a fair and fun experience

430
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:29,249
and nobody has an unfair advantage over

431
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:33,508
the other players in their game that

432
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:35,739
graph which unfortunately weighs a bit

433
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:38,649
not that pure but it's a graph from

434
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:41,230
Bloomberg the article that it's lifted

435
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:43,178
from discussed the amount of players

436
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,980
that have been departing a very popular

437
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:47,309
game players on player unknowns

438
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,440
battlegrounds it's a battle royale game

439
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:52,799
and it's the number of players that were

440
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,649
driven away by cheaters so there was a

441
00:18:52,799 --> 00:19:00,580
survey conducted and the game has an

442
00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:03,070
in-game survey as well why people

443
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,779
abandoned over a certain time scale I

444
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,119
think it was six to twelve months why

445
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:09,399
they abandoned playing the game and the

446
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,470
main reason was than the prevalence of

447
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,850
cheaters inside of the environment

448
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,100
inside of the game it's pretty

449
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,809
frustrating for you to spend thirty

450
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,988
minutes on a match and then some guy

451
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:21,220
teleports in front of you should you

452
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:24,190
shoot your character and then you're

453
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,980
dead and out of the game and whoa what

454
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:32,619
was that so it's a big problem for

455
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:34,350
gaming companies and the whole let me

456
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:36,759
say the whole issue revolves around

457
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,769
detection and prevention so you want to

458
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:41,139
detect players who are actively cheating

459
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:43,299
and you obviously want to try to prevent

460
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:45,309
them from cheating usually on a

461
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:47,379
technical level so actually disabling

462
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:51,940
cheats or making sure that cheats can't

463
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:55,029
function correctly now it is special in

464
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,460
that it's only a gaming problem but it's

465
00:19:55,029 --> 00:20:00,309
also there are commonalities with

466
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,409
malware the modus operandi of most

467
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,980
cheats is very similar to malware from

468
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,919
certain purse

469
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,720
effectives so every cheat has to somehow

470
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,730
access a different process the game

471
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,679
process and they do that in two ways

472
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,480
they either open a handle and do like

473
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,790
read process memory write process memory

474
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,490
stuff or a common malware technique they

475
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:21,879
inject the DLL open a thread and then

476
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,910
run the DLL inside of the context of the

477
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,100
actual game process right so what do you

478
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,049
need to actually figure out how to fight

479
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,909
cheating you need to be know reverse

480
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:33,309
engineering because you probably will

481
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,080
just get the cheat habit inject take a

482
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:38,980
memory dump of the game with the cheat

483
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,740
inside and analyze that for example you

484
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,200
need to understand the concept of DLL

485
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,600
injection how it actually runs so the

486
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,870
skillset in itself if you know aunty Mel

487
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,500
were probably with like a small segueing

488
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:55,840
to a few unknowns you will be capable of

489
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,150
understanding cheats as well the biggest

490
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,570
difference and this is unfortunate one

491
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:04,150
is that compared to malware cheats are

492
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,790
run voluntarily right so somebody will

493
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,960
just download the executable

494
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,820
double-click it because they want to

495
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,070
cheat in a game whereas with malware you

496
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,600
need to also take care of the vector how

497
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,730
do you convince somebody to double-click

498
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,219
it well here it's no concern they will

499
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:23,559
voluntarily double-click it so cheating

500
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,090
can be a bit weird since it's such a

501
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,399
specific problem and if you're not a

502
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,870
gamer like hey why is that even that

503
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,630
interesting why would you even spend

504
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:34,000
time money resources on fixing something

505
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,100
like that for one it's incredibly

506
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,640
frustrating for players I as a gamer

507
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:42,189
have been frustrated an immense number

508
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,590
of times by cheaters in the various

509
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,960
games I was playing but more recently

510
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,159
with this evolution of gaming as an

511
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,679
industry and with all of the

512
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,260
competitions around it took this snippet

513
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,510
from Reuters the latest fortnight World

514
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,360
Cup had at the grand prize three million

515
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:01,629
dollars all in all the tournament I

516
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,820
think paid out a hundred million dollars

517
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,980
to all of the participants so just

518
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,720
actually participating at the Fortnight

519
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:11,640
World Cup that happened this year

520
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:15,130
guaranteed you 50k US dollars so

521
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,170
cheating within the context of an eSport

522
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,690
event could be a potential

523
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,580
problem because the PR and all of that

524
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,860
if it turns out that somebody cheated

525
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:27,370
and won a tournament but most

526
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,740
importantly it's the the image that you

527
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:32,679
present right if your game is insecure

528
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,750
from a cheating perspective people won't

529
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,280
be tempted to play it because they know

530
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,080
they will never have a fair playing

531
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,940
ground and then there is nothing there's

532
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,679
nothing fun about it right in soccer

533
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,470
if the other team would be allowed to

534
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,720
pick up the ball and run with it

535
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:50,340
it doesn't really work out right so

536
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,320
their incentive for cheating is actually

537
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,209
is slowly becoming monetary gain until

538
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,010
now it was just other either annoying

539
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,780
other players or the challenge of

540
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,000
reverse engineering the game and getting

541
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:07,000
your cheat to work but it's moving into

542
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,060
more financial aspects now and that kind

543
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,920
of wraps it up these are the more

544
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,919
interesting topics that we deal with in

545
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:17,710
terms of security as a gaming company so

546
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,970
I'll pass it along to the link where we

547
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,150
can go if you want to find out a bit

548
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:24,910
more details and the Q&A if anybody has

549
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,370
any questions alright guys thank you so

550
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:32,310
much

551
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:32,310
[Applause]

552
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:43,170
so we have one question here hello thank

553
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,300
you for a very interesting presentation

554
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,610
unfortunately I'm not playing but my son

555
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:52,419
does so what I'm interested in

556
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:54,070
when this players cheat so as I

557
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,690
understand maybe I don't understand it

558
00:23:54,070 --> 00:24:00,129
correctly but as I understand it some

559
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:01,840
problem in implementation yes so after

560
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,300
it makes a game I think you have to make

561
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,520
it's a proper pen test and all these two

562
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,290
staff to denies is cheating quite

563
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,620
doesn't work like this

564
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:13,570
so cheating is a problem on PC it

565
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,129
doesn't really happen on like lockdown

566
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,439
consoles and it's not a an

567
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,380
implementation issue it's an issue of

568
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,570
how Windows works right windows exposes

569
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,910
certain api's that allow you to read and

570
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,010
write process memory they expose create

571
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:30,430
remote threat API which allows you to

572
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:32,830
within from one process to another spawn

573
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:36,000
of thread and run that code it cheating

574
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:38,260
is possible because of our key textural

575
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,230
computer functionality it's not

576
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:44,140
something it's not a bug in our code

577
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:47,440
it's just how pcs work and it's mostly

578
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:50,590
Windows because that's like 99% of the

579
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,040
pie for cheating is PC gaming on Windows

580
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:55,750
operating systems if there were no API

581
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,649
is that allowed you to do inter process

582
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,560
communication

583
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:02,800
you couldn't cheat technically I mean

584
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,500
sure it's this is a bit narrowing it

585
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,690
down but it's not a vulnerability in the

586
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:11,650
game code it's just how computers work

587
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:13,660
and what we do about it is to again like

588
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,180
I mentioned detect it so for example

589
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,340
detect the foreign DLL running in your

590
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:22,630
code or even prevent it if you have the

591
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:24,550
technology to strip rights from an open

592
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,260
handle for example when the process

593
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,000
opens a handle if you strip certain

594
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,100
rights from it and it can't actually

595
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,950
read or write process memory then you

596
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,679
also kind of prevent that that cheat

597
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,930
from working but it's it's not as simple

598
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,000
as read my code and fix something there

599
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:43,630
because it's just not gonna work like

600
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,770
that okay thank you welcome

601
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:49,770
I think so we'll take a question there

602
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,060
so we have a problem with the spare mic

603
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:07,480
hi thanks firstly for your presentation

604
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,970
and secondly for having finally Romanian

605
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:16,680
first league in FIFA 20 coming back to

606
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:19,390
security wise I know that the novo has

607
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:23,170
kind of issue and from gamers

608
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:26,260
perspective lately the the time it's not

609
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,950
that large like in between you launch a

610
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:33,100
game and it's correct have you

611
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:35,050
reconsider and it of course most used in

612
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,240
your games yeah have you considered

613
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:40,450
moving to another third-party or

614
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:43,860
improving this kind of improving here

615
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:46,570
constantly moving to another third-party

616
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,699
it's always a consideration we just want

617
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:51,730
the best I personally just want the best

618
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,650
technology unfortunately and this is my

619
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,140
own personal opinion so this is not

620
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,300
reflective of EA's stance in any way I

621
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,190
don't think there is a better solution

622
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,409
on the market today and you're right I

623
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,450
think the last one was three days or

624
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,520
something that's not a fantastic amount

625
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,920
of time but that's just the situation

626
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,650
and that's why I felt it's important to

627
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,770
propagate the concept that it's not

628
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:16,330
uncrackable don't base anything that

629
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,100
you're working on on the fact that it's

630
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,750
not gonna get cracked for a certain

631
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,699
amount of time I know I know but I

632
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:24,130
suppose it costs a lot of money for you

633
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,890
guys like if it takes you launch the

634
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:28,450
game and it takes two or three days to

635
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,940
crack it crack the Deneuve around the

636
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,980
tempering it's that's your loss that's

637
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,080
the situation that's the industry and

638
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,820
that's the status quo we're always

639
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,580
trying to improve but it's not always

640
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,500
possible especially in like I would call

641
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,649
six months for improving an ante

642
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,600
temporary short timespan and URI our

643
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,520
reaction time realistically is probably

644
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,469
not six months but maybe two weeks three

645
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,970
weeks and that's just unfeasible

646
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,970
sometimes okay thank you

647
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:10,960
one hand raised there two more questions

648
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:15,520
okay hello thanks for the presentation

649
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,310
about the monty piracy anti temper topic

650
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:22,110
have you ever thought about going drm

651
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:23,379
free they will crack the game anyway

652
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:27,129
yeah

653
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:31,350
again I can't really speak to EA's

654
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:36,070
stance on that it's been a consideration

655
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:38,830
but it's in a company so big it's

656
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,360
sometimes difficult to actually get

657
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,600
everything set in stone as you might

658
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:51,000
want it to so yeah I can't really speak

659
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,000
to that on the record okay

660
00:28:53,850 --> 00:29:02,189
hello thank you for your presentation do

661
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:04,890
you think that when cloud gaming will be

662
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,680
implemented the cheating will be still

663
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:10,050
possible yeah crowd yeah they're gonna

664
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:14,310
sniff Network packets figure out which

665
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:16,230
packet means what input action then

666
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,169
they're gonna scan the screen I mean

667
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,010
it's already been done it's it's called

668
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,010
a pixel Qi

669
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,090
so basically scans the screen

670
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,770
understands what's on the screen they

671
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,500
use a bit of ml sometimes you actually

672
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,120
make it move a bit faster and then it's

673
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,680
just a matter of sending the appropriate

674
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,570
packets down the pipe so I'm pretty sure

675
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:37,710
cheating will still be a thing only it's

676
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:43,980
going to be a bit more complicated to

677
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:46,140
actually get done all right can you take

678
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,780
one more I know everybody wants to go to

679
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:52,260
lunch but it's so exciting okay so we

680
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:54,990
have this gentleman here nice

681
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,490
presentation what I have to ask is about

682
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,440
the future

683
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,570
platforms gaming platforms let's say

684
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,210
that the fifth generation is around the

685
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:05,429
corner it has a hardware solution but

686
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,430
let's look further into the future like

687
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:13,560
the sixth generation where there will no

688
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:16,050
be a hardware solution available Google

689
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,590
already has stepped into this realm with

690
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:23,399
Google Styria let's say if EA has a

691
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:26,370
solution of this standard moving into

692
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:30,150
the cloud gaming service will that be a

693
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:36,629
more secure realm or more secure let's

694
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:38,760
say that's a very interesting question

695
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,620
actually um yeah I I think it would be

696
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,300
and the main main main thing is that

697
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,570
you're no longer running that thick

698
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,190
client on the players / customers

699
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,200
machine which means that you're not

700
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,910
running 1 million lines of code that

701
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,470
could have vulnerabilities inside of

702
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,650
them on the machine you're running it on

703
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:58,950
the server and exploit switching to

704
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:02,460
cloud gaming exploits become I think

705
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:04,920
less likely more impactful but the

706
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,960
upside is that instead of impacting our

707
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,620
customers and our players they're just

708
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,440
gonna impact

709
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,860
it's gonna be on us to fix it since we

710
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,570
can ensure that the light client is

711
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,790
locked down and solid and then it's just

712
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:21,270
a matter of making sure our servers are

713
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:24,120
lockdown and solid so yeah I am a big

714
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:26,250
proponent of moving to cloud gaming if

715
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:31,580
we're strictly talking about securing

716
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,580
our players and our customers thank you

717
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,390
okay thank you so much China's Vaughn

718
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:40,579
let's give them

719
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,579
[Applause]
