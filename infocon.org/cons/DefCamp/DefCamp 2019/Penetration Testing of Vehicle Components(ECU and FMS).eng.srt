1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,560
the topic is the penetration testing of

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:10,740
the vehicle components like ECU and the

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,410
deplete management systems so I'm Aaron

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,730
Manny I'm the founder and director of

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:21,779
the Amina siq labs LLP that particular

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,810
focused on the the component the

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,150
services like hardware testing

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,448
industrial control systems vehicle and

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:36,149
telco products as well so my interest

10
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:38,460
lies in those those field and I'm the

11
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,559
speaker and trainer of different

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:46,590
conferences like Def Con and death camp

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:49,230
has let's start the presentation so so

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,719
this this is the definition for those

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,919
people who don't know the car actually

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,960
so it's it's for more than more than

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
three our other cancer more than two

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,469
wheels they call it as a car and they

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,989
transport one people to another one

20
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,740
location to another location and that

21
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,798
you can find on Wikipedia so if you talk

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,880
about the modern car so you will find a

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,540
lot of components over here like the

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,990
Bluetooth Wi-Fi telematic telematic

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,500
devices even key folks key entry you can

26
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:30,179
say with the key folks or keyless entry

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:34,020
in that case we have obd2 TPMS tire

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,000
pressure monitoring systems and body

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,640
controller module or rather you can say

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,549
engine control unit electronic control

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,610
units those those those components you

32
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,920
can see in the modern car so what

33
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,110
exactly the can-can is nothing but the

34
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:55,409
controller area network so it's modern

35
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:58,409
the communication protocol for used used

36
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,680
for use in vehicles rather you can say

37
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:05,729
their transportation so it's a two wire

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:11,069
protocol so can high and low and its

39
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:13,990
uses differential signaling so 1987 they

40
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:16,839
the boss was the company who

41
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,090
reduce the can canvas protocol and it

42
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,420
has a two type of protocols like you can

43
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:25,330
- 1.0 and 2.0 and again 2.0 has the two

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,309
parts a a and B so it's difference

45
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,820
between the a and B is like identifier

46
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,570
bit

47
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,060
it's a 11 bit and in 29 Peters so what

48
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,760
we are targeting over here is we talked

49
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,850
about the physical physical testing of

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:46,480
the car or rather you can say the the

51
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:50,799
ECU so sorry about that so OB - it's a

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,920
onboard diagnostic port you can say here

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,060
if I talk about the Oh buddy - it's it's

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:02,500
it's like in u.s. is mandated in 2004

55
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:05,770
the every car sorry in 2009 1999 they

56
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,130
they every car should have the Oh buddy

57
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,840
port so first they introduced obviously

58
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,090
the orbital one then they come up with

59
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,190
Aubrey - if I talk about the European

60
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:19,240
standards they call it as a EO pd o

61
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,630
buddy so that specifies the architecture

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,120
of the not exactly the pin pen

63
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:28,960
description of the Oh buddy - and here

64
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,390
you can see six and 14 are used for the

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,940
can low and can high and you can see

66
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,390
over here like five and four of the

67
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,570
signal ground and the chassis ground so

68
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:43,929
whenever we talk about the campus or

69
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:48,370
rather Albany - it always works on 12

70
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:52,690
volt edges so where you can find obd2

71
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,210
port like if I talk about the car so

72
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,960
there are different places you can find

73
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:02,230
the obd2 ports like it's nearby the

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,200
driver seat may be on the rear seat as

75
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:09,850
well backside also so mine car is a like

76
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:13,119
electric car in India so I have obd2

77
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:16,510
port on backside at the at the backside

78
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,230
and the one over T 2 port is on the the

79
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:22,630
rave seat of the driver so there are

80
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,910
different cases you will find those

81
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,490
structures in white sometimes in the

82
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,550
black so sometimes you come up with

83
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,389
the the female obd2 or mailed over

84
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,009
Tidrow depending on the manufacturers

85
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,780
sometimes you'll see those kind of over

86
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:41,889
t2 as well so in that case you need to

87
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:45,008
have some sort of the converter so in

88
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:47,380
that case if we talk about the usb are

89
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:49,960
rather db9 cable so you need to have the

90
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,389
veenai to obd2 converter or in that case

91
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,849
you will have it this specifically I

92
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:59,500
believe it's it's from the Mercedes so

93
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:03,099
if you open any ECU rather engine so you

94
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,349
might find those kind of the structure

95
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:09,430
other port where you can you need to

96
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:12,099
find out the USB db9 to this this kind

97
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,660
of pin numbers so that particular pin

98
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:17,080
numbers are described like four and

99
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:21,160
fives like ground another 14 and six is

100
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,229
four can hand can blow so how the ECU

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,099
looks like so it's a kind of embedded

102
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:30,070
systems so they use the microcontroller

103
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:31,659
instead of the microprocessor so microf

104
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,430
assessor I can give you the example of

105
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:36,760
Raspberry Pi it's a microprocessor right

106
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:40,479
so we can install Linux rather raspbian

107
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,490
OS right but in an ECU it won't be

108
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,180
possible it it's pure microcontroller

109
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:49,000
and if you if you compare the entire

110
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,479
coding the skeleton or rather the number

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,159
of lines number of lines of codes with

112
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,979
respect to the Facebook and other social

113
00:05:54,159 --> 00:06:01,659
network it's a huge if I compare with a

114
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:04,030
modern modern car so it's very huge it's

115
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:05,860
a billions lines of codes in the car

116
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,489
modern car so if you compare with the

117
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,599
Facebook

118
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,580
it's very less the core lines of course

119
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:17,259
of Facebook is very less than the modern

120
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:20,590
car so in that case the all structures

121
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:24,210
are other course it's it's in C language

122
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:27,609
and it supports a lot of

123
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,979
microcontrollers which which take which

124
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,960
flash the entire code inside so if you

125
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,840
see there are a lot of capacitors some

126
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,270
crystals over here so it's pure embedded

127
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,700
systems so we'll come to the hardware

128
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,020
part as well how these things are

129
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,289
vulnerable for

130
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,198
harder attacks as well so this is how

131
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:51,520
when when when you see the internal

132
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:55,629
parts of modern cars so every every

133
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,479
every every devices has rather features

134
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:01,270
has some sort of the ECU we call as a in

135
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,690
control electronic control unit so

136
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,520
nothing but this thing so very small

137
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,509
it's different on the sides it's they

138
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:14,919
depend on the the size of the what

139
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:19,120
exactly the device inside the car so in

140
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:23,169
the modern car you'll see more than its

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,060
minimum like more than 200 ECU's in the

142
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,948
car so if you snip the entire

143
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,500
communication in the car itself will get

144
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:32,740
lot of communication on the while you're

145
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:37,780
sniffing the entire communication so the

146
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:40,659
these are the some features features for

147
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,799
the modern car like every seat controls

148
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:48,690
infotainment systems then emergency

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,969
brake systems and ventilations HVAC

150
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:54,460
everything has some sort of embedded

151
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:57,310
system be called as ECU so every issue

152
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:01,239
has some sort of the functions or rather

153
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:05,050
you can say event to perform so again

154
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,669
the control unit as I said so what about

155
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,319
the fork protocol different kind of

156
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:12,729
protocols you will see so if I if I

157
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,180
distinguish this protocol as per the

158
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:18,130
requirement as per the data rate so it's

159
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,610
a Lin protocol it's a one wire protocol

160
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,469
so where the data rate is very slow and

161
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,349
if you see the requirement is very low

162
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:31,870
actually if I compare with the canvas

163
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:34,059
canvas has a huge demand in the and in

164
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:38,520
the market as well so the data rate

165
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:42,130
would be the hi-hats if I see sorry if I

166
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:45,490
if I talk about the Flex take the same

167
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:48,310
now the flexor is getting outdated but

168
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,649
the speed of the flexor is very higher

169
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,819
than the canvas but the requirement also

170
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:58,060
it's get increased so as I say

171
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,270
the canvas is the two-wire communication

172
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,209
can Hank and lo and it uses differential

173
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:06,430
signaling so if you see the differential

174
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,370
signal over here can hack and lo but it

175
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:11,920
has some sort of you know the packet

176
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,140
frames so arbitration ID here is so

177
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,010
important in that case when you when you

178
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,870
trying to do you know pen testing or

179
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,020
rather you can say some sort of attacks

180
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,560
on the ECU or other in the car itself

181
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:31,300
physically so it's a DLC and pin data

182
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,449
and then CRC and end up the frame so if

183
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,839
I see the can network so in on the

184
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,700
single bus not we cannot save the single

185
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,560
/ sexually so in the main bus you will

186
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,920
see lot of components are attached like

187
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,920
ECU lamps head ECU headlight headlamp

188
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,750
they sees you then lights ECU these are

189
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,240
the different kind of issues connected

190
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,640
with each others so what's what's the

191
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,060
how it communicates it will only

192
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,080
broadcast the message so if it is

193
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:04,000
broadcasting the message so what exactly

194
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,240
how they identify a rather you can say

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,130
if if they broadcast at the same time

196
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,400
which would be which one will be the

197
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:16,510
higher highest priority message

198
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,540
so it's depend on the arbitration ID so

199
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:22,840
the if the arbitration ID is low then

200
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:25,900
the message would be the would have the

201
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,750
highest priority on the can message so

202
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,850
let's say the break break has a the

203
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,700
arbitration ID very low because it's

204
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:37,110
emergency at the emergency you push the

205
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,700
brake and that's the execute

206
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,640
mechanically with the help of ECU right

207
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,280
so in that case the arbitration ID of

208
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,040
the break would be always be less than

209
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,949
other other messages because it

210
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,360
dominates that arbitration ID to other

211
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:57,340
can messages so here in that case if if

212
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,830
you want to do some sort of reverse

213
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,140
engineering of particular event like a

214
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:05,050
brake headlamp or rather you can decide

215
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:08,180
indicator a lot of things or other you

216
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:11,990
can say rpm so we need to find out what

217
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:15,829
kind of the the arbitration ID in that

218
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:22,010
case so in a can transmission if I say

219
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:24,740
the ECU a1 and ec2 and ECU 3 so these

220
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:28,100
are the messages let's say 3 & 3 so it

221
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,950
would be 1 second 52nd and 250 seconds

222
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,339
so it's a the time difference between

223
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:36,080
two consecutive messages so it's very

224
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:38,720
important we need to find out the

225
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,420
message the time difference between the

226
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,810
two messages for particular thing so

227
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:48,319
it's depend on the what kind of message

228
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,359
it I say if it is break so so time tram

229
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,040
travel or other time difference between

230
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,589
the two consecutive message would be a

231
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,910
very less because it's fast faster than

232
00:11:54,589 --> 00:12:01,070
the other messages so what are the

233
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,439
extended protocols for the canvas these

234
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:08,420
are the protocol like iso TP protocol

235
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,940
can open GM lang s s EEG so one at five

236
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,130
zero PWM see these are the different

237
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:17,060
kind of protocols which is based on the

238
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:20,360
canvas and which can be the extended so

239
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:23,000
depending on the if I talk about the GM

240
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,050
Lam is the gentle motor land so it's

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,440
internet-based protocol as well so and

242
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:35,719
if we compare the entire protocol with

243
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:38,720
with the with the obd2 ports so here see

244
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,060
as I say the 6 and 14 numbers for the

245
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,529
pin numbers for the canvas scan high

246
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:52,029
infant and low and key k WP l link and

247
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:54,560
the other PWM and M scan these are the

248
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:57,650
these are the pin numbers for the

249
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,189
different messages so what are the tools

250
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:04,370
you can see in the while doing some sort

251
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,470
of the testing so there are some

252
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,660
commercial tools are available here I

253
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:12,410
listed a few of them commercial tools

254
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,360
not few and only single so value can

255
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:16,189
three is one of the good tool you can

256
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,100
say in the market so there are some

257
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,380
tools like vectors canopy there are some

258
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,110
optimizer from the Germany this

259
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:28,040
duels in very expensive this tool is

260
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:30,950
cost around the 390 or $400 and the and

261
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,230
the software cost around maybe from 150

262
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:38,560
to 400 $4,000

263
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:40,910
100 to 4,000 1000 to $4,000

264
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,619
so if I talk about the software is

265
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,860
really costlier than the hardware itself

266
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:50,150
so there is open-source tool called as

267
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,770
us between so here we are doing the car

268
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,660
hacking village over here so you can see

269
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,270
this this kind of tool in car hacking

270
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,339
village and you can see the live demo of

271
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,520
the how we can do some sort of the

272
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:04,910
canvas testing and the the how we can

273
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:08,300
crack the seed keys or the ECU as well

274
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:11,920
so can us between is supports only

275
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,900
canvas message not the lint protocol and

276
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,229
this is the same thing inside the they

277
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:22,610
use a microchip even they can us between

278
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:27,950
uses microchip chipset even in this Tula

279
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:30,770
so they use microchip and this can used

280
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,200
or with the hell with the help of can

281
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,750
socket that can scan utility of one of

282
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,040
the library and you can find it on Linux

283
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,480
so if you install can can you Till's you

284
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,480
definitely attached with these things it

285
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,910
has a see TTL to USB converter so you

286
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,890
can connect with the Linux and you can

287
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:53,240
start sniffing those communications as

288
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,819
well so this is one of the cool tool is

289
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,270
called a scan badger so these guys are

290
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,610
the creator of the can badger is one is

291
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:04,250
Ferdie and he's the xavier right soon so

292
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,680
this car is very genius i follow them

293
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,900
actually personally so they're good

294
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,920
researcher and they they they make this

295
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:16,360
scan batcher it has two dp9 cables and

296
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:21,349
the third net as well so they made

297
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:24,860
declined software the it seemed like a

298
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,270
bob suit so you can intercept the

299
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,490
communication you can change the

300
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:31,370
communication and send it to the issue

301
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:34,200
or other car so it's like you can you

302
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,930
can see the talks

303
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,230
in hardware i/o 2016 they call it as a

304
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,719
car hacking like a bub suit so if you

305
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,519
see these things really amazing then you

306
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,160
can same Judas packets

307
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:50,970
I study P packets and ton of things you

308
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,389
can do and if you search for the can

309
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:58,889
badger on the github you'll see the bomb

310
00:15:54,389 --> 00:16:01,620
so within 100 125 dollar you can make

311
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:04,380
those devices and and now they are

312
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,810
coming with a pro version I believe

313
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,329
within 5 months they're going to release

314
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:15,050
that can badger pro its but it's really

315
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:17,160
cool can tools is one of the software so

316
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,859
even the u.s. between and the other

317
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:25,469
software can work with this the scan

318
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:28,769
tools is from the Russian guy for linen

319
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:31,050
for lane as of now we we can see this

320
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:35,250
the microchip Lynn as analyzer so

321
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:39,229
microchip gives the windows-based the

322
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:41,940
software from there it can analyze the

323
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,560
lint protocol and you can send it and

324
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,750
receive it those kind of protocols as

325
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,899
well but there are some protocols like

326
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,399
there are some tools commercial tools

327
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:54,870
available in the market like optimizer

328
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,930
or other you can say the vector as well

329
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:00,390
so what kind of attacks you can perform

330
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,160
on the canvas we can we can we can

331
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:09,929
perform the toss attack it's nothing but

332
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:13,649
if I do if I like here in Oh buddy - if

333
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:15,630
I short this thing with Canon camera it

334
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,390
becomes DOS again it's it's like a

335
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:21,480
physical but what we can do with on the

336
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:24,179
or the packet is itself so in the or the

337
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,309
packet it's like if you saying the zero

338
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,549
zero zero the message on particular ID

339
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,379
and that that can cause the denial of

340
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:35,580
service a denial of service attack on

341
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,679
the particular de canvas fire rose again

342
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:42,510
so as I said in the firehouse

343
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:46,080
so this speed is very critical right so

344
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,580
let's say we have 500 milliseconds 1 e

345
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,399
c.o transmits those message

346
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,949
with the 500 millisecond so what

347
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,070
happened if you same same thing that

348
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,080
message with the 500 millisecond so it

349
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,689
would be same right so there is no

350
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,639
effect on the the the one particular

351
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,220
issue so we need to reduce these things

352
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,320
we can reduce one millisecond 10

353
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,370
millisecond so what message goes first

354
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,080
on the particular issue and you can see

355
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,229
the effect on this called as fire roars

356
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,230
attack

357
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:23,550
Spyros that means it's related to our

358
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,950
the the transaction so packet payload

359
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,870
modification so he can modify the

360
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,990
payload so you can inject some sort of

361
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,090
other packets as well which can it may

362
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:36,330
be you Dias it may be anything like if

363
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,550
you know the ID and if you know the idea

364
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:42,780
is responsible for reset ECU or other

365
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,610
you can you can talk to ECU to dump

366
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,410
entire the information about the

367
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,169
firmware other you can dump the firmware

368
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:53,250
over the ID so that that thing you can

369
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:56,460
do with the packet payloads modification

370
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:59,010
packet replay so again it's the same you

371
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,110
can you can record the entire session

372
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:03,629
and you can replay it there will be

373
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,929
possibility that that that can be a

374
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:11,130
replay attack right after right before

375
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:13,860
it's kind of the attack where if you

376
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,690
have the malicious packet first and then

377
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,060
you are sending in legitimate packets

378
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,040
there is a possibility that's FIFO and

379
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,440
LIFO is it's it's happening on the

380
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,990
microcontroller that that triggers a

381
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,000
buffer overflow attack on the ECU itself

382
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,280
the same thing if you send the

383
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,140
legitimate packets first then the

384
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,639
malicious packet after that there is

385
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,860
again there a possibility you can

386
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,600
trigger the buffer overflow attack on

387
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:41,310
the particular particular issue so for

388
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,889
that purpose you can you can come to our

389
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:47,210
the car hacking village and we'll see

390
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:50,460
the live demo that how we can do sit-ski

391
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:53,100
or rather silky cracking or rather you

392
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:57,030
can say the other dos attack and fire

393
00:19:53,100 --> 00:20:00,360
hose attack on the speedometer itself so

394
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,320
now it's a FMS it's a fleet management

395
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,479
systems

396
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,129
so if we see over here the management

397
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,139
systems over here it's connected with a

398
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:15,779
lot of communications it supports the

399
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:19,229
GPS locations and the its it supports

400
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:22,409
GPRS and gsm 3g 4g depending on the what

401
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,769
kind of the fleet management uses the

402
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:27,720
communication and that's connect to the

403
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:28,590
the tracking server is nothing but the

404
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,860
manufacturer

405
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,389
are there any vendor which sub which

406
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,908
gives the service of fleet management

407
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:37,500
system and from the client PC or other

408
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:40,110
mobile you can track the entire

409
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,139
communication the what exactly the USB

410
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:46,830
over here the location so location is a

411
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:50,668
main critical area because you have to

412
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:53,879
understand rather we have to see where

413
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:56,820
where exactly my the vehicle is going in

414
00:20:53,879 --> 00:21:00,719
which direction so for that purpose they

415
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,129
use fleet management systems so what are

416
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,110
different kind of attacks you can

417
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:06,719
perform so fleet management systems like

418
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:10,080
a obd2 dongle are there any kind of PC

419
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,059
you they call it as a transmission

420
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,830
control unit or rather telematic control

421
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:19,470
unit that's that resides in the the

422
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:23,820
car Network and from there they connect

423
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:26,940
with the GPS and from the GPS to GS

424
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:30,029
sorry GSM to the cloud and cloud to your

425
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,879
PC or other mobile and that supports GPS

426
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:34,679
as well so when I was when we are doing

427
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:39,330
some sort of hardware testing so we

428
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:42,710
found some the the WP ROM that SPF flash

429
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:46,470
so we could not find any protocol or the

430
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:52,799
GPS though I can do some sort of you

431
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:54,690
know the GSM GSM the GSM jamming or

432
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,668
rather you can say they can I can make

433
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:02,370
the fake GPS fake BTS and that that yeah

434
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:04,710
that fleet management system can connect

435
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:08,309
with my fake BTS and I can intercept and

436
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:10,980
I can try to inject some SMS if it is

437
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:14,110
supports SMS or rather any any can

438
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:20,290
message on the on the D BTS through the

439
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:24,040
yes itself so what we found the the the

440
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:27,190
SPI chipset and we have the programmer

441
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,428
that is cs3 for one a programmer and we

442
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,830
connect with the DSP a chipset and we

443
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:35,950
extracted and we found this information

444
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,720
from the these things we found here is

445
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:42,100
the IP address here is the some

446
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,130
companies link and the company link and

447
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:48,520
here's some IP addresses which is

448
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:50,740
hard-coded inside the SPI ROM and these

449
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,799
are different some phone numbers these

450
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,330
are the phone numbers when they use the

451
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,918
fleet management system and they

452
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,110
registers the mobile number

453
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,330
so you'll find those mobile numbers here

454
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:04,479
so this is again one kind of

455
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:07,510
vulnerability you can say and this is

456
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,900
the serial numbers so when we scan this

457
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:14,620
IP address so with the help of n map we

458
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:18,780
found the this FTP server it's running

459
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:21,820
on particular thing and we found all the

460
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,678
bin files that is firmwares right so

461
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,530
these are the former's which is used for

462
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,580
the fleet management systems and what

463
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,690
happened when when we extracted those

464
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,370
firmwares and weed and reverse

465
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,890
engineering so we found some sort of

466
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,659
passwords over here so username password

467
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,840
for a particular link so I cannot show

468
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:43,419
that links actually but this is how we

469
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:47,260
found a very juicy part and we try to

470
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:50,760
control that particular devices and we

471
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:54,370
can easily locate the where exactly the

472
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:56,890
the other devices other devices are

473
00:23:54,370 --> 00:24:02,199
registered devices on the in the fleet

474
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:06,340
management systems so then we do done

475
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:10,660
some GPS spoofing so we have the hack RF

476
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:14,260
and we have GSM antenna the rather GPS

477
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,360
antenna so initially this is this this

478
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:19,720
this addresses from the Pune India

479
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,790
actually so we are driving the car with

480
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,780
a fleet management system so initially

481
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:29,270
we were here then we move further so so

482
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,940
we spotted over here then our car is

483
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:35,480
here and you can see we are moving

484
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,250
around and when we start gsm spoofing

485
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,490
this is the one of the very good tool

486
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:43,190
gps SDR sim is one of the Japanese guy

487
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:48,370
who created this software very nice you

488
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:51,560
can you can use the software but but but

489
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:54,800
it's depend on you actually so how can

490
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:57,620
use that and how we can use for

491
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:01,760
malicious things so what we do we

492
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:04,189
mention our coordinates with the the GP

493
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,180
SIM bin so that that particular bin file

494
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:11,720
has a as the coordinates and with the

495
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:15,460
help of hack RF and the the GSM antenna

496
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:19,460
we executed this data

497
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:23,780
geum's gps sim data and what found our

498
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:27,140
car is in New York right so we were in

499
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:30,680
India after spoofing the coordinates our

500
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,600
car is in is in New York USA and we are

501
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,130
driving the car and you can see the the

502
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,189
car is moving from one location to

503
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:40,100
another location so this is another kind

504
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:42,470
of one ability with with the GPS still

505
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:46,310
we are figuring out the what this

506
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:48,800
solution it is like if it is GSN

507
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:51,080
spoofing if you want to avoid the GSM

508
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,409
spoofing and even the the device is very

509
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,620
small so there are some techniques to do

510
00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:00,080
that but if someone has a solution you

511
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,469
can talk we can discuss after the talk

512
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,010
actually so how we can mitigate this GSM

513
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:09,440
spoofing so so how this is it's very

514
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,260
critical because it's a it's a USB for

515
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,690
the those people who makes the fleet

516
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:18,860
management fleet management systems what

517
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:22,220
happened your car is get stolen and and

518
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:25,479
your yours try to see where where

519
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:29,450
exactly your car and someone is from the

520
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,800
very genius robber rather we can say the

521
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:37,130
thief he can do some GPS GG GPS spoofing

522
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,870
and you can your cars can put instead of

523
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,470
romanette can put in India or somewhere

524
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,239
else and

525
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,330
you cannot look at the exactly the car

526
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:48,260
verities so this is the this this was

527
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:53,299
the one apparatus we found in Africa

528
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:55,690
management systems and everything so any

529
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:55,690
questions

530
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,809
hello Aaron thank you very much for the

531
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:13,590
nice presentation I have a question do

532
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:18,899
you know when the can has started to be

533
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:21,780
encrypted the year the can can message

534
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:25,890
can yeah when they started to implement

535
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:29,580
encryption on the camp when when they

536
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:33,299
started encryption encryption which year

537
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:38,189
they start the carmaker's encryption so

538
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:40,379
I don't believe actually so so there is

539
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,299
no encryption but there are some things

540
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,730
you can implement the gateways they call

541
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:47,010
it is a gateway like like an IT sector

542
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:50,100
we use firewall right so in that case

543
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:52,500
they can use the gateways it's acts as a

544
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,049
firewall they can you switch between the

545
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,289
issue and the your sensors as well so

546
00:27:55,049 --> 00:28:01,770
it's it's depend on the how the big how

547
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:04,020
your the architecture of your car and

548
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:07,950
based on the architecture and based

549
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:10,889
based on the the safety security

550
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:14,070
standards and the cyber security and

551
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,500
ERDs when you implement some sort of

552
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,850
cyber security solution you have to take

553
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,010
care of the safety standard as well

554
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,408
sometimes what happened there there

555
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:25,289
would be a delay in the message in the

556
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:28,700
in the in the or the ECU so that can

557
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:32,908
hamper the safety security as well so

558
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,860
according to we we call it as a tera and

559
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:37,110
they call it a sahara

560
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,750
so tar and Jara we need to match those

561
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:41,850
things the threats and we need to come

562
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,870
in a particular state where we can our

563
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:47,850
be able to use any critical solutions

564
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:51,449
like a gateways or a firewall in that

565
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:53,309
case and on on which protocol on which

566
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,440
device or rather you can say which

567
00:28:53,309 --> 00:29:00,629
feature that that's that's the thing

568
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:05,220
that ok think your own I have another

569
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:07,830
question here you can start the engine

570
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,860
of unlock the car if I have connected

571
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:15,199
the

572
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:18,199
obd2 dongle yes so in this in this

573
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,900
example that that that only reads the

574
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,360
message not writing any message on the

575
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,420
ovary - so if it is reading message like

576
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,439
you need to check first whether your FMS

577
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:33,260
like fleet management system is able to

578
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,660
start your engine or not if it is if

579
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,850
that fleet management system has those

580
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,720
kind of features yes definitely

581
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:43,310
so if you can hack rather you have

582
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,270
access on the cloud and you know the

583
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:49,550
particular FMS the device we can send

584
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,860
those message to that MMS and from the

585
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,200
FMS that can message sent to that

586
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:57,889
particular or the obd2 that can be

587
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,800
possible a rather rather if you do some

588
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:03,230
sort of reverse engineering first of the

589
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,530
car what the message is responsible for

590
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,690
to start engine off engine opening door

591
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:13,639
and that particular message you can

592
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:16,820
inject through the MMS or the G GPS of

593
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,940
certain GSM or the 3G or 4G so you only

594
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:25,129
you need to make some sort of the fake

595
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:28,310
inor if I talk about the 4G if it is 2g

596
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:32,990
you need to you know create a fake BTS

597
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:38,360
in that case thank you we'll take one

598
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:41,060
more question yes okay hi very great

599
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,120
presentation but my question is was a

600
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:46,610
simple driver I I can protect myself

601
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:50,030
from some attacker or something like

602
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,229
that so I don't know some all this kind

603
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:54,710
of stuff that's that's really

604
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:57,410
interesting question actually it's the

605
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:00,700
user standpoint of view actually so

606
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:03,590
there are a lot of possibilities that

607
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,870
nowadays a lot of the technologies

608
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,110
talking about the ADSI anomaly detection

609
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:12,110
systems so that thing can be possible

610
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,639
and if it is there would be possibility

611
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,590
there's some people some research

612
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,080
researchers are working on the

613
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:21,379
prevention system as well as some

614
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:26,360
incident occurs they can kill

615
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:28,039
the canvas message but it's no it's not

616
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,689
exactly the word I cannot use that

617
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,780
particular word but the in layman

618
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:34,940
language yeah it can kill the the canvas

619
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,610
message so there would be in future that

620
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:42,020
a lot of possibility that that thing's

621
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:45,469
the ideas or the the prevention system

622
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:48,740
can implement in the ECU and that issues

623
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:51,620
itself sufficient like it detects

624
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,539
automatically and it it killed that

625
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,479
particular message so still we are also

626
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:59,419
on this pace of research actually we

627
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:11,530
made a TS but we are in - in the face of

628
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:15,380
the prevention system as well yes for

629
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:17,720
reversing you want to do the kites lock

630
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:21,049
and you don't have physical access to

631
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:27,799
the obd2 connector you can hack the car

632
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:32,658
yes yeah so so there is a different ways

633
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:34,760
to open the car actually so you can you

634
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,620
can do some sort of replay attack on the

635
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,629
key folks or the relay attack on the

636
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,168
wireless key that that would be a

637
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:44,600
possible

638
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:47,299
I know but forget about the key and it

639
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,340
won't be possible but yes anyhow if you

640
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,470
open the bonnet there there is a

641
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:59,330
possibility they can connect directly to

642
00:32:51,470 --> 00:33:03,530
the ECU and that that yes but this this

643
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:06,470
this thing is the penetration testing

644
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:09,830
point of view that talk is it is so it's

645
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:12,409
not like but if you have access you

646
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:15,980
don't need to obd2 as well you can just

647
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:17,690
do some sort of the short circuit

648
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:25,690
there's some wires and you can start the

649
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:28,840
car and go away that you can because yes

650
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:33,370
there's nothing like the movies

651
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:36,540
yes okay thank you so much

652
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,540
[Applause]
