1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,940
good morning so I really appreciate you

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,648
guys for coming early morning talks so

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,700
it's really difficult to attend early

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:15,750
morning talks so I appreciate that

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:20,009
so my name is Anne Bonny I'm founder and

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:23,698
director of - ik lapse LLP eats Indian

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,300
based company and we are into hardware

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:31,140
IOT ICS and vehicle we do a lot of

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,899
research in those sector and I am also

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,350
the speaker and trainer for a lot of you

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,590
know conferences including deaf can so

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,480
what exactly the ICS ICS is nothing but

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,370
industrial control systems like it's

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,169
consist of a lot of components like a

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:52,649
PLC's then hm eyes then then then r2 and

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,840
the SCADA systems so whole thing's is

17
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,539
called as the industrial control systems

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,410
so industrial control system is like so

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,660
critical for every nations so let's

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,158
understand what exactly the SCADA HMI

21
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,380
and the PLC in r2 and in very short

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,820
actually so SCARA is another thing but

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,250
the supervisory control and data

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,589
acquisition it's a type of the

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,189
industrial control it's a part of this

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,549
industrial control systems but if we

27
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:27,990
compare with IT is nothing at like if we

28
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,350
compare with the Siem tool right so it's

29
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,240
takes logs from the other devices

30
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,460
Network Devices OS and everything and

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,589
put it on the graphical user interface

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,298
rather graphically and they understand

33
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,400
the what the what kind of alerts is

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,220
there the same thing over here is like

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,899
it represents the process process

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,310
nothing but operation technology in that

37
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,130
case we call it as a OT so here HMI is

38
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,159
like human machine interface it's

39
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,158
specifically dedicated to the plc

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,320
devices our Tod Isis so these these

41
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,409
these this comes with a graphical user

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,329
interface so what we are trying to say

43
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,869
like it comes in to players it's a

44
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,959
hardware based the HMI and the software

45
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,780
based HMI so Optima is nothing but our

46
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,500
classical thing is covered

47
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,960
like the web applications or any any any

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:24,730
front-end which represents the graphical

49
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:27,340
thing of any very small operation scored

50
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,100
as HMI and if I talk about the hardware

51
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,050
is nothing but it's a display right so

52
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,180
display comes with a touchscreen and

53
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,040
every everything like buttons and

54
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,220
everything so it requires human

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,720
interaction so this is called as nothing

56
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:46,690
but HMI in hardware so RT U is nothing

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,359
but remote terminal unit so it's the

58
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,609
same like PLC but it's it's not advanced

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,709
than PLC but there is a very small

60
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,010
difference between the PLC and the R -

61
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:59,200
it's a telematic units so it's not a

62
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:08,049
telematic it's a telemetry units so in

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:10,839
that case so the the the telly the they

64
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,989
use modems connected with the any

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,310
hardware device this called as RT so

66
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,950
this is the main difference between the

67
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:21,760
PLC and the hard.you

68
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:25,450
so PLC's programmable logical controller

69
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,760
that connects with the sensors and this

70
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:31,119
connects with the sensor which comes in

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,269
the level 0 level 1 so on the level 1 is

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,220
always beyond the PLC's so it's a

73
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:39,549
programming language and if you see over

74
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,049
here is like I see 6 1 1 3 1 - 3

75
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,730
programming language there are different

76
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:47,260
kind of programming language nowadays it

77
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:51,850
the every PLC supports so this is this

78
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:54,070
is same like I hurt you but the sorry so

79
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,370
the key difference is really different

80
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,200
so like key differences the tele

81
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:04,390
telematic or rather you can see

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,578
telemetry device so this is how the this

83
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,640
first one is nothing but this Kara and

84
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:12,250
this is how the the HMI which is in

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,988
hardware fashion so this is nothing but

86
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:19,060
hard you but you can see this very small

87
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:22,030
the display is nothing but HMI as well

88
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,940
and this is kind of the PLC as well so

89
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:28,159
PLC PLC and the art you and

90
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,710
in the behind the rtu you will see

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,280
always the modem which is where which is

92
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:37,820
connected with the 3G 4G or 2g

93
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,549
connection so what exactly the typical

94
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,950
our typical architecture of the industry

95
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:49,550
control systems so whenever we talk

96
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:52,370
about the ICS network it starts with

97
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,500
these sensors like sensor over here

98
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,180
sensors and actuators let's take an

99
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,190
example of water dam right

100
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,770
so water dam has some kind of sensors

101
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,170
which responsible to close the door or

102
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,719
open the doors these sensors are

103
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,840
actuators over here and that sensor goes

104
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,420
to the the RT or the PLC and that goes

105
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,020
to the or the communication network and

106
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,180
they connects to this the master devices

107
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,340
so if you go in little bit depth it's

108
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,460
like a felt field instrument on the at

109
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,859
the end of the network we call it as a

110
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,409
these sensors then send it to the PLC

111
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,370
rather rtu and over the communication

112
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:34,190
network maybe a Wi-Fi maybe not Wi-Fi

113
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:38,000
exactly it's maybe RF or maybe you can

114
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:40,310
say the the wide Network right so

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,230
Ethernet communication whatever it is

116
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,500
under communicate with the SCADA

117
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,690
machines so this is how the field

118
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,460
engineers or rather any operation

119
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,010
technology works in the industry of

120
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,109
control systems so what are the

121
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,870
communication protocols if I talk about

122
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:01,610
this communication between the PLC's and

123
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,680
the SCADA machines and between the PLC

124
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,169
to PLC there should be some protocol

125
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,840
like so protocol would be like depend on

126
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:12,950
the what are those criterias like if we

127
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,200
talk about the process oriented protocol

128
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,120
rather you can say the metering protocol

129
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,880
you will see the modbus serial and TCP

130
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,810
protocol so modbus serial for used for

131
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,610
process and metering meter reading those

132
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,320
kind of stuff those kind of

133
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,770
communication you can see on the model

134
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:35,120
bus protocol dnp3 whenever see when you

135
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,919
talk about the dnp3 or IEC 61850 - 4 so

136
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,260
these are protocols used in the

137
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,740
electrical utility so these electrical

138
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,289
utility

139
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,539
use those kind of protocols so PROFIBUS

140
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:47,719
again it's the same like a Modbus but

141
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:49,969
the the the packet structures and the

142
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,210
the the the flow of communication is

143
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:56,090
differ from the Modbus but but is for

144
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,039
the process communication back knit if

145
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,690
you talk about the back nod back net is

146
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,389
mainly used for the building automation

147
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:06,560
so if you see the lips rather you can

148
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:09,050
say the the skyscraper buildings are

149
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,940
there so so these building automation is

150
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,800
done by the back net protocol and back

151
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,979
net is nothing but proprietary protocol

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,509
from the Siemens but it's it's again

153
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:23,000
vulnerable so why why we are

154
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,620
understanding the security because if we

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,669
talk about the industry control system

156
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,590
we are nothing but talk about the

157
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:33,080
nation's right the nation's wealth it's

158
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,869
it's a backbone of every nations so it's

159
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,370
may be nuclear plant it may be

160
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,440
electrical utility because these are

161
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,840
connected with every infrastructure like

162
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,840
a banking and the health and everything

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,400
because we require the electricity so in

164
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,810
electricity flows everywhere in every

165
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,359
sectors so because of this being a very

166
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,880
niche area being a very important area

167
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,070
in the in the in the nation wise so

168
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,560
there are a lot of incidents happens

169
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,389
like this state-sponsored attacks you

170
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,880
can see in this field actually

171
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:08,300
state-sponsored attacks with the

172
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,300
well-known well-known well-known

173
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,479
Marvel's like toxnet Havoc's black

174
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,789
energy dukkha and n number of ransomware

175
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,310
in the in the comes in their industry of

176
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,750
control systems nowaday so when it comes

177
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,960
to the industrial control system

178
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,210
specifically its attacks on the machines

179
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,580
like like the windows machines they

180
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,948
usually the field engineer used their

181
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,039
software's like to program the SCARA

182
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:38,450
application if any change comes in the

183
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,429
pictures to program the PLC's rather we

184
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,039
can talk about we can take an example of

185
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:45,229
solar energy or other wind energy those

186
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,660
peoples are same machines they use for

187
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,420
the conferring configuring some gateways

188
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,680
morbus gateways like I don't take other

189
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:56,910
any in you can take any

190
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,310
manavas gateway example and and same

191
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,490
machine used for monitoring those the

192
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,800
SCARA machines as well so this is what

193
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,440
the implications like if something

194
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,920
happened with the with with the software

195
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,370
rather someone someone inject some

196
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,979
malware's rather anyhow it in in in a

197
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,140
different way through a different attack

198
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,230
vector malleus comes to the picture so

199
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,330
it will encrypt if it is ransomware it

200
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,029
will encrypt the entire entire machine

201
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,700
or rather if it is any succinate or

202
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,650
rather any black energy kind of malware

203
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,520
so we can you know attack on process

204
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:39,569
communications part so if you it's a

205
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:42,300
it's 2015 statistics but if you if you

206
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,029
compare with two turns 16 17 18 19 it's

207
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,870
a huge attack you can see in ukraine and

208
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:51,000
the other part of world so these these

209
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:55,190
are the things where if we talk about

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,050
the 2010 and 2011 you'll see those

211
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:02,040
information related to the tux net which

212
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:05,370
affected in 2011 and 2012 and after that

213
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:09,569
it comes to the 2014 as well so you'll

214
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,850
see that n number of and the different

215
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,870
type of families of malware introduced

216
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,640
in the this year's so so what exactly

217
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,110
the challenges we are facing so

218
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,410
challenges like it's a lack of knowledge

219
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,630
so people don't know how the industry

220
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:28,829
control systems works people know about

221
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:30,930
the EIT right IT routers and everything

222
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,700
the people come to know what exactly

223
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,140
they these things but when it comes to

224
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,209
the actuator when it comes to the

225
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,490
instrument instrumentation or other

226
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:40,529
instrument engineering so that that

227
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,260
becomes very niche area right

228
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:46,200
so it requires industrial experience as

229
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,700
well so if you want to make a career or

230
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,600
rather if you want to learn those kind

231
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,400
of niche area you have to be prepared or

232
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,620
rather you have to be have knowledge

233
00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:00,270
about the industrial control systems and

234
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:04,110
the communication part so if I talk

235
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:07,829
about the Banger researcher being being

236
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:10,050
the hardware hacker in that case so I

237
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:12,899
rather pentester see you should come up

238
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,420
with a your lab setup right so lab setup

239
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,910
that is again costliest so if you're

240
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,660
going for the industry control you have

241
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,939
to purchase PLC's then setup then you

242
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,850
have to learn all the communication then

243
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,640
after that once you get get ready with

244
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,350
the entire setup then you can start you

245
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:35,040
know hunting those one ability or rather

246
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,649
you can say the you can do some sort of

247
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,170
the research so again due to hardware

248
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:43,310
includes in the setups its its cost

249
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:48,899
includes as well so its costliest

250
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:51,899
experiment as well so there are some the

251
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:54,170
simulations available in the market with

252
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,640
respect to the protocol so like a Modbus

253
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,439
like a dnp3 protocols there has

254
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,930
simulations so you can connect with

255
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,589
those simulation and it works on the IP

256
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:07,019
address and you can start you know the

257
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:10,620
research on at least the protocol level

258
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:13,529
but here in in in this talk we are

259
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,660
talking about the the protocol itself

260
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:16,920
and the hardware itself or why the

261
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,100
people's a lot of people's not

262
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,620
considering the hardware attack on

263
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,870
particular you know the the industrial

264
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,870
control in the circuit or system devices

265
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,870
like a PLC's are third-party vendors

266
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,970
like the Modbus gateways they use

267
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,519
there's so mobile neverold with respect

268
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,230
to the the hardware device so if you

269
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,149
talk about the simulation there are

270
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,040
different kind of simulation available

271
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:43,230
the Modbus pal it's another kind of

272
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,420
simulation con port is another kind of

273
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,310
honey port actually so if you if you

274
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,319
guys in the threat intelligence you can

275
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,410
use corn port you can modify and you can

276
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,310
it looks like any kind of you know the

277
00:12:52,410 --> 00:13:00,719
interface of the any PLC's like Siemens

278
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:02,790
600 Siemens 200 1200 or 1500 you can

279
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,920
make a lot of changes in the convert and

280
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:09,180
you can upload it on the particular

281
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:12,449
things gas port is nothing but a AST

282
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,510
protocol is like the the above the tank

283
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:17,990
protocol is related to the pumps scarab

284
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:21,560
er is another free open-source

285
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,240
the SCARA VR is the free open-source

286
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,099
application where you can connect with

287
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,500
those devices with the scarab ear and

288
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,020
you can do a lot of ton of things so you

289
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,610
can use modern spy if you're very

290
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:34,579
interested in the Modbus communication

291
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,520
there are different types of the

292
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:40,279
libraries available so multiple spa or

293
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,010
Modbus dot pi is the good library we can

294
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:45,140
you can create those libraries or script

295
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,029
so you can connect with the the Modbus

296
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,060
communication or they can force the

297
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:51,980
entire communication even the dnp3 open

298
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,899
dnp3 is another kind of libraries you

299
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,640
can use it and you can do some sort of

300
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,940
fuzzing as well so there are different

301
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,310
kind of tools available like nmap is the

302
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,560
if you're going with an nmap so you

303
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,589
should make sure that you have something

304
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,979
the script related to Modbus so if we if

305
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:12,260
you do some sort of blind blind port

306
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,640
scanning so it will create a havoc in

307
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:18,649
the in the system itself so at the end

308
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,360
what we are doing so we were interacting

309
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,399
with the hardware and Harvard doesn't

310
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,260
know what exactly the protocol or what

311
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,820
they exactly the data so there would be

312
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,260
possibility you can create the DOS

313
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,920
attack in the inter entire

314
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:34,700
communications PLC scan is one of the

315
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,099
good tools there morbus libraries

316
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,320
available for the scanning skaara

317
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,660
machines there for the Modbus as well

318
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,459
the wire shake is one of the good things

319
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,870
where we can intercept the communication

320
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:47,089
you can understand the what kind of

321
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,640
communication is going on and you can

322
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,100
detect the entire protocol and based on

323
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,079
the protocol information you can do some

324
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,270
sort of replay attack really attack and

325
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,579
ton of things after getting the

326
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,800
knowledge of the protocol emitting gates

327
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:03,649
it's it's again the tool where we can

328
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,319
show you the demo as well video demo

329
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:09,579
where how we can use that Mbita gate and

330
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,810
we can interact directly to the PLC's

331
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:14,510
Gasport commands it's nothing but the

332
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,180
asd commands which actually the device

333
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,610
the embedded device rooted on the pumps

334
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,569
where it takes the measurements of the

335
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,579
all the diesel and and the and the

336
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,829
patrol and everything and it shows the

337
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:30,109
static sticks and these communications

338
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,270
are still you know who the plaintext so

339
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,220
we can use those commands and

340
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,890
you can interact and you can change some

341
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,250
statistics on the microcontroller itself

342
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:43,220
and it shows different values to the

343
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:46,520
engineers so now we are talking about

344
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,590
the Modbus Modbus is nothing but the the

345
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,230
protocol which is originally designed

346
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,030
and introduced by modicon now it is a

347
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,770
Schneider so it's a royalty-free

348
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:58,939
protocol and it's it's it's a most

349
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:01,810
standard protocol in the industry

350
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,290
control systems like if I compare like

351
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:06,349
this

352
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,510
I can't I cannot say the 60% but at

353
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,000
least 40 to 50 percent you can see those

354
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,710
move this Modbus protocol used being

355
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,200
used in the industrial control systems

356
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:18,970
so this is the huge and the standard

357
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:22,010
protocol followed in the industries and

358
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:25,310
and if you see this Modbus communication

359
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:28,069
so it's a master and slave based

360
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:31,130
protocol actually so whether it is a

361
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,890
serial or whether it is the you can say

362
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,510
the tcp/ip protocol so if we talk about

363
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,240
the serial there are two type of Syria

364
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,430
like rs-232 and not for rs-485 it's

365
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,760
depending on the voltage how old age how

366
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:46,550
much voltage you are using for which

367
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:51,920
serial communications so as I said it's

368
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:55,010
a mossad call and the master is pulls

369
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,280
the information from the slaves that

370
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:03,710
that thinks and every mohammad master

371
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:06,770
can communicate the 247 slaves that

372
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:09,079
means you can every master can have 247

373
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:13,450
slaves at the in the indian network

374
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:16,909
itself and this is this is this is like

375
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,440
very clear text protocol there is no at

376
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,030
all authentication if you snip the

377
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,950
entire communication and you can see it

378
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,579
on the Wireshark you will come to know

379
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:28,820
the what how it will never election so

380
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,129
if it if you dissect the entire the

381
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,980
protocols so there are some key things

382
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:37,640
we need to take care of it here like as

383
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:41,090
a pen tester as a as a hackers or any

384
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,070
any background or rather developer so

385
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,870
key key thing is a function code

386
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,439
actually so if you know the function

387
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,959
code

388
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,990
exactly so you can communicate with the

389
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,789
register values coil values so if I talk

390
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,009
about the coil that means I am talking

391
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:58,100
about the digital values that is zero

392
00:17:55,009 --> 00:18:02,090
and one like like like to take example

393
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:04,340
of the water dam that shut down that is

394
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,559
shut down the entire door or you open

395
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:10,820
the entire door when it comes on zero

396
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:13,039
and one like one is like the it will

397
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,830
close the entire door and zero is for

398
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,960
opening the door so this when that

399
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,029
function is comes into the picture we

400
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,009
call it as a point when it comes to the

401
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:24,649
temperature as temp temperatures like

402
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:27,259
let us take an example of nuclear plant

403
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:28,969
right so in that liquor brand if region

404
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:31,580
fusion reaction comes into the picture

405
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,820
so temperature goes in a different level

406
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:37,370
right from from this threshold like like

407
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,529
a 35 degree to 80 degree so 80 degree

408
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,809
would be the threshold value when it

409
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:43,970
goes to threshold value so it gives

410
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:46,340
alarm right so in that case we can see

411
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,950
the register values comes to in the

412
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,320
picture when it comes to it

413
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,980
this information is required for the

414
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,610
developers rather you can say what you

415
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:02,029
can say it's for the engineer so SCARA

416
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:05,689
programmer they do those kind of stuff

417
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:09,950
actually and the function code is like

418
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:13,220
if function code 1 is used you can see

419
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:16,669
the read twice and for single coil you

420
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,580
can use function 5 and holding register

421
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:22,940
function 3 and write single resistor 6

422
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,918
and ton of things like read and write

423
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,610
multiple resistor you can use through 23

424
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:31,509
so there are n number of the function

425
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,370
codes available when it comes to the

426
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:36,830
comes to the picture actually so if you

427
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,840
buy any PLC device which supports Modbus

428
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,629
protocol so they come up with the

429
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,360
datasheet very they mention everything

430
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:50,178
about what kind of function codes that

431
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:53,620
particular PLC supports so it's now it's

432
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,620
a demo time so

433
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:17,320
so here I'm and we have the PLC and we

434
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:20,470
have the panel hardware panel where some

435
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:27,570
indicators are here some some actuators

436
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:32,910
like on and off right so here is like

437
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:37,090
here I'm turning on that is green signal

438
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:41,860
rather alarm you can say and when I turn

439
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:45,699
on that particular switch so it open

440
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:52,979
it's activated this thing so when doing

441
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:52,980
that particular yes

442
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:10,049
so as I said so if I use my tea gate so

443
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:13,889
I will I will use function the function

444
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:16,260
which is I can read the coil values so

445
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:21,809
turning on and off it's nothing but 0

446
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:24,390
and 1 for the the indicator so here I'm

447
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:29,250
using R 1 is a function with respect to

448
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:31,380
the n beta gate and - 0 - a 0 is I'm

449
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,470
starting from the offset from 0 address

450
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:41,880
and this is IP address so you can see

451
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:46,590
the 1 value for 0 0 0 0 address and this

452
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:50,760
is why the green signal is on the

453
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:56,070
indicator so if I do off and if I again

454
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:58,650
read the same value so you'll see on the

455
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:03,570
second line it's of 1 right

456
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:06,000
so I toggle that from left to right so

457
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:09,139
you can see the on memory address there

458
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,140
something is changed

459
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:44,559
so here again I switched it on suit on

460
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:47,110
the so now the PLC has the input and

461
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,770
output so output would be our indicators

462
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:55,510
input will be the actuators so so I know

463
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:58,690
I know the the memory address for the

464
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:04,030
output so it's it start start from the

465
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:06,880
256 so when I do any things like switch

466
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:14,200
ON switch off so it will shows one value

467
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:17,860
over here for 256 so if I do off so you

468
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:21,400
will see here is a 0 0 values so that

469
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,990
means there there are the 4 input and

470
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:31,510
output they are located some memory

471
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:35,710
addresses in the PLC itself so what

472
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:38,740
happened if the our malware is in the

473
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,480
industry control systems and the our

474
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:44,169
malware is talking on the Modbus

475
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:48,039
protocol and our job is to the attackers

476
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:50,080
job is to so gives false positive alarms

477
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:52,419
like in that case it should be a green

478
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,760
but it's supposed to be green but it's

479
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:57,130
showing your red alarm right so in that

480
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,280
case what I will do I will change that

481
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:03,070
value particular to the output and it

482
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,820
will shows red so let's do that actually

483
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:09,658
so we are writing the coil values that

484
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:17,080
particular thing that particular address

485
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:20,860
and that is our 257 for the red value or

486
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,250
rather red alarm and 256 for the green

487
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,250
thing

488
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,730
[Music]

489
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:46,140
okay so if I do the right command for

490
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:51,559
257 and if you see this thing is get

491
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:54,570
change to rate thing so the the thing is

492
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:56,490
the engineers or rather we can say field

493
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,840
engineer get confused what exactly is

494
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,820
happening in the in the process

495
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:05,780
environment so there are different ways

496
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,780
to mitigate those problems while

497
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,560
there are different ways to different

498
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,510
ways to mitigate those problem we can

499
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,760
use different kind of gateways a

500
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,890
unidirectional gateways which can

501
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,990
encrypt the communication from one end

502
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:34,490
to other end but it's really difficult

503
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:36,950
to those solution implement in existing

504
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,810
in infrastructures because of its a

505
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,820
cost-effective or rather you can say the

506
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:42,590
hardware dependency or rather you can

507
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,270
say the critical process it's really

508
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,840
difficult to change those devices in

509
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,200
that case

510
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,689
so let's come to the let's comes to the

511
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,150
hardware part so if you open the

512
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,820
hardware let's say we we saw the PLC

513
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:58,160
device right so if you open the PLC

514
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,830
device you will see some sort of the lot

515
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,640
of PR PCB about printed circuit boards

516
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:07,100
and you try to find out some you can say

517
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,010
the test pads so test pad nothing but

518
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,320
the URJ tag anything so when you are

519
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,570
hunting the uart port is there a lot of

520
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,850
possibilities you will find two or three

521
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:20,179
your products singer your output so in

522
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:22,669
that case in some some some some devices

523
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,770
we found to you at port one is for the

524
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,360
debugging purpose one is for the the

525
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,270
monitoring purpose like monitoring

526
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,860
whatever you do some changes at the end

527
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,990
of the hardware you will see the some

528
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,060
locks right that that is called as a

529
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,830
monitoring purpose and debugging is like

530
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,139
you are directly interacting with the

531
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,120
firmware are there any changes we can do

532
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,540
on the embedded systems that thing is

533
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,610
for a debugging purpose so in that case

534
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,340
we need to find out first the Rx and TX

535
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,590
and ground which can connect with your

536
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:55,070
the your device and you can easily

537
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:59,389
interact with the particular target

538
00:26:55,070 --> 00:27:01,100
device and in this way there are

539
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,630
different ways to do that you can do

540
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,969
with the manually with the help of

541
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:08,720
digital multimeter there are different

542
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:11,180
ways you can do with the jtagulator so

543
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,910
jtagulator is nothing but the automated

544
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:17,150
thing like like for port scanning we use

545
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:20,030
and map so for hardware interface for

546
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:23,600
understanding the UART and JTAG they use

547
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:25,520
jtagulator to to find out the particular

548
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,090
you are and the

549
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,000
JTAG so as I say that we found to you

550
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,889
arts in a particular devices one is for

551
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,110
debugging purposes one is for the

552
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,800
monitoring purpose but the fact was

553
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,820
different

554
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:44,149
so when we found that particular the

555
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,370
UART so we when we connect we found the

556
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:50,510
root axis on the particular devices

557
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:52,459
without any credentials so so when one

558
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,170
port is one port is asking for the

559
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,030
credential one poor when you are

560
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:58,190
disaster in for the credential one you

561
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:01,600
are Dez asking for it's never asked for

562
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:05,350
the D credentials that's what it

563
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,780
believes so in that case we found

564
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:11,600
something this device and nothing but

565
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:14,889
the r2 so nowadays our to you comes with

566
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,629
extra RAM actually and it has a

567
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,280
minimalistic Linux server on the

568
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:22,370
particular machine because it supports

569
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,690
the web application as well so when it

570
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,580
comes to the web application there are a

571
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:28,190
lot of possibilities they they come up

572
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,649
with the Linux machine so in that case

573
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:33,770
we found the baud rate one one five two

574
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:38,270
double zero and then we fall into the

575
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:39,889
the root shell and we check that what

576
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:42,379
exactly it is the LS command is working

577
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:45,380
so from the LS command we come to know

578
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,630
that this is the root ax root folders

579
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:51,350
and that some files are there so if we

580
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:54,110
go to e TC and passwd you will find the

581
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:57,678
credentials as well so this is how the

582
00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:02,209
the particular hardware you know testing

583
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,790
done so here you can say that there is a

584
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:07,880
different way to extract those things

585
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:10,940
what if the UART is disabled

586
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,890
JTAG is disabled so what what other way

587
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,990
you can find out so there are different

588
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:18,500
kind of chipsets on the PCB board like

589
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:21,320
the NAND flash rather you can say SPI

590
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,850
these are the EE purim SPI and i2c so

591
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,490
there are a lot of possibilities some

592
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:29,928
some engineers store some firmware and

593
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:32,210
stay in the in the in the SPI EE P ROM

594
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:34,370
or other i2c double EEPROM rather they

595
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,220
store some data like credentials and

596
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:40,549
everything a s key in the

597
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:44,600
in the particular thing so so this is

598
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:49,100
how we done with this is the EE P ROM

599
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:53,269
programmer that SPI and i2c we have the

600
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:57,289
clip the SOI c8 clip so I see it testing

601
00:29:53,269 --> 00:30:00,380
clip is like it has a 8 legs on the SOI

602
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:02,929
see chipset that is EE pyram and we

603
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,690
found that this is the SPI right so

604
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:08,529
that's why we use 3 0 4 1 a it's a

605
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:11,419
Chinese device which comes with very a

606
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:13,909
four-dollar right so if you go for a

607
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:16,669
commercial thing its cost around 300 or

608
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:20,840
$400 but it's a really cost effective

609
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:23,960
that can connect with the EE phenom and

610
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,289
from EE P ROM we can extract the entire

611
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,000
data once you extract the data I will

612
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,370
come to know that this communication

613
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,559
then after that we found some credential

614
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,959
so whatever u changes on the web

615
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:38,480
application or rather root level you

616
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,480
will see over here so so the initial was

617
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,879
the root admin root right mean so we see

618
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,659
some changes so we found those

619
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:50,539
credentials as well so whatever you do

620
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:53,210
update the web application or rather any

621
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:55,580
firmware changes it stores in that SPI

622
00:30:53,210 --> 00:31:00,259
so this is how architecture and this is

623
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:03,529
this device is the Modbus gateway that

624
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:06,320
converts the modbus serial to Modbus TCP

625
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:09,919
communication and this is how you can

626
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,330
find that data from the once we extract

627
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,860
the data from the chipset and you will

628
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:16,970
come to know these those credentials as

629
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:21,590
well the conclusion is it's like it's

630
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:24,830
it's need to be secure from the hardware

631
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:27,439
perspective as well because if I talk

632
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:30,230
about the Mira Mira is again the the

633
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,129
botnet and they have n number of

634
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:36,009
different families of the brain Mira

635
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:38,059
botnets which which has a which

636
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:39,830
communicate can communicate on the

637
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:42,110
differ default credentials and they can

638
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:46,070
flash the entire firmware and they can

639
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:48,490
do some sort of nasty things again there

640
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,149
is should be a security awareness and

641
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:53,390
there should be

642
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:59,360
bug bounty program for these industrial

643
00:31:53,390 --> 00:32:02,900
control systems protocols and if you do

644
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,820
you have any questions yeah let's take a

645
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,620
round of questions my colleagues will

646
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:13,279
help you by giving the mics out in the

647
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:16,399
audience what's your opinion

648
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:20,840
SCADA securing like fire role versus

649
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:23,090
uni-directional gateway so it's

650
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,970
dependent on the first it's depend on

651
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:28,850
the the architecture so if target

652
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:31,490
stepped architectures with with respect

653
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:34,309
to current state architecture

654
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:36,470
if you modifying those architecture with

655
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:38,330
respect to the security so it's

656
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:41,570
depending on the what kind of devices

657
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:44,689
you have in the in the level 0 level 1

658
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,639
and level 3 so I would recommend if if

659
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:49,399
it is a three point five level three

660
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,870
point five level that is DMZ you can use

661
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:57,379
ngf and next-generation firewall and if

662
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,918
comes to the level two and level one you

663
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,049
should use

664
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,210
unidirectional Gateway search actually

665
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:06,889
so there are different kind of gateways

666
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:10,520
like if we talk about the upu PX o OPC

667
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:12,620
ua you can use that kind of gateways as

668
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,720
well that communicates with other

669
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,850
different protocols so it's different

670
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,289
from the protocol 2 protocol if your

671
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,629
industrial control systems or other

672
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:22,610
entire communication works with a

673
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:27,020
different type of protocols like

674
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:30,260
including IEC 61850 and the Modbus so so

675
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:33,440
in that case you have to check which

676
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:36,440
which device can fit but unidirectional

677
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:46,789
gateway is the best option ok and did

678
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:50,559
you work with flip flip let's take a

679
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,559
question from the other end of the room

680
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,200
so if you want to yeah so if you want to

681
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,658
start with hardware hacking so first you

682
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,790
need to find out which devices is for

683
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:24,250
use for the hardware hacking that is

684
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:27,500
Mustang then you can buy Chinese devices

685
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:29,570
so this Chinese device is very lost a

686
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,940
low cost effective and still well

687
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,530
neighbor so it's a best practice we can

688
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,110
do the hardware hacking on the Chinese

689
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,720
devices apart from the US or the

690
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:44,150
European devices now US and European

691
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:47,389
devices soo so you know secure from I

692
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:49,610
think so as for my knowledge 2015 from

693
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,699
2015 they are securing a lot of devices

694
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:57,320
so if you buy any device Chinese device

695
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:59,560
from the the Aliexpress there lot of

696
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,960
chance you can get the the

697
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,820
vulnerabilities in the device itself so

698
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:13,400
I would recommend you any web camera

699
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:25,160
which comes in 220 dollars so they're on

700
00:35:13,400 --> 00:36:01,880
the but definitely you can kind of you

701
00:35:25,160 --> 00:36:04,370
require so can you share with us more

702
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,820
technical details or information about

703
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:11,630
the recent nuclear power plant

704
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:15,500
cyberattack in India yeah I can explain

705
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:17,840
after talk actually okay thank you that

706
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,200
did some interesting stuff we have

707
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:23,150
actually but it's it's recording entire

708
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,649
stuff so I cannot explain as of now but

709
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:30,830
yes I can I can I can explain it after a

710
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:32,660
top all right right thank you very much

711
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,790
for this awesome presentation and for

712
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,000
the teaser of why you should look him up

713
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:39,470
during the coffee break but before the

714
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,700
coffee break let's give him a round of

715
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:44,738
applause

716
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,739
[Applause]
