1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,670
thank you for for joining and to quickly

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,900
introduce myself and I know we're a bit

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:11,790
a bit behind the skit and the schedule

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,929
so my name is Sebastien Navarre I've

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,460
been working in IT for 20 years I've

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,948
started more on the technical side of

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,990
things then become more interested in

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,080
how do we organize security Houghton and

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,538
how do we manage security and this is

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,400
how I ended up being more involved in

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,570
the commercial side dealing with

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,500
contracts which was the reason for

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:40,200
starting with with this topic and we've

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,960
we see here a lot of technical talks and

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,469
there is indeed a very important part

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,090
about technology in security but that's

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,579
not all there is we have to remember

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,360
that security is about how do we defend

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,629
our organizations and if you look at the

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,760
modern-day organizations everybody has a

21
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:02,099
large number of IT contracts that their

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,090
services depend on I mean that's the

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,840
reality of modern-day economies and you

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:13,350
have an entire web of applications which

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,009
underpin your IT infrastructure and when

26
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,630
you do not put security properly into

27
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,330
the into those contracts that govern

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,548
those those services that can lead to a

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,539
lot of wasted time and of course to a

30
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,619
lot of security issues and

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,960
through-and-through marking throughout

32
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,290
my career I've worked on many times I've

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,298
been on the receiving end of having to

34
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,250
consume services delivered through

35
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,900
contracts I've been on the consulting

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,640
side and I've been working in

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,680
organisations providing those those

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,399
services that were governed by the

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,390
contracts I've been even in internal

40
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,149
audit team and doing audits of contracts

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,979
and services and I try to capture in

42
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,040
this talk some of the things that I

43
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,670
learned along the way and hopefully to

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:08,039
help to have those things not to happen

45
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:10,739
that often anymore and what I like to to

46
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:13,619
call the original scene that we still

47
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,150
see happening quite frequently the

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,540
bit less now nowadays but it's still

49
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,489
quite for me we just don't we just don't

50
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,239
put security enough in the contracts we

51
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:26,670
we treat security like something that is

52
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,060
going to to come at some point later and

53
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,578
that's that's not that's not the best

54
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,230
approach because when you do not put

55
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:38,040
something in the contracts from the

56
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,379
beginning then you'll have to find very

57
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:45,030
hard after the contract is signed to get

58
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:48,060
that change and security at the end of

59
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,890
the day is just is just another quality

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,930
aspect of the service that you're buying

61
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,089
and you want to say yeah I want you know

62
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,670
this service or this product that I want

63
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,609
it to be this secure so you have to say

64
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,619
that that you want it and like anything

65
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:03,239
else in the in the contract if you

66
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,340
expect something to be delivered you

67
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,760
have to you have to write it down in the

68
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:12,049
contract and trust me well especially

69
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,459
nowadays when everybody is doing

70
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:16,230
contracts at the lowest price level

71
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,730
possible if something is not written

72
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,160
down you will not get it for free

73
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,590
companies do not think for free that's

74
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,370
that's a reality that's why you need to

75
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,459
say what you want and the very important

76
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,280
implication of that is that the we as

77
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,310
security professionals must get involved

78
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,230
with with the commercial guys it's um

79
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,109
it's something that we have to get into

80
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,138
the habit of doing we have to talk with

81
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:45,389
the commercial guys with the lawyers and

82
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:50,419
get into the habit of participating in

83
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,419
their in their contract negotiations and

84
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,260
we some some are doing it and we see you

85
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:01,470
know quite often things and what I would

86
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:05,010
like to call the the phantom claws Manus

87
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:09,599
the famous the supplier shall follow the

88
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:12,448
customer security policy well why is

89
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,019
that a problem well it's a problem if

90
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:18,060
you only do that and this is a very good

91
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,970
example of how you really have to think

92
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,729
about all the snaps because if you just

93
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,620
say security policies what's that there

94
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,840
is you have to say these are the

95
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,570
documents which constitute my security

96
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,299
because usually companies have a whole

97
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,310
set of documents its policy in status

98
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,680
standards guidelines you have to say

99
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,320
what those documents are so you have to

100
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,900
leave them in the contract you have to

101
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,139
say which versions in most companies

102
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,989
update their security policies on a

103
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:52,650
relatively frequent and frequent basis

104
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:54,540
we have at our company we have by policy

105
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,560
we have to review and update all the

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,240
policies at least once once a year so

107
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,270
the contract is usually going to be

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,220
running for quite a few years which

109
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:09,810
version of the policy are applicable to

110
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:14,400
that to that contract where do you get

111
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:17,460
those contracts you say to your business

112
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,650
partner yeah you need to - to follow my

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,359
policies where are they do you have a

114
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,799
repository where you make it available

115
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,110
for your for your business partners and

116
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,240
I've seen and this is some of the worst

117
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,190
stories that that I will share through

118
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,870
the through the talk I've seen what

119
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,200
happens when this is not specified I've

120
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:40,350
actually seen a security team which had

121
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,050
created a very nice and detailed set of

122
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,760
security policies which they didn't

123
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,099
advertise in the contracts and with the

124
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,340
suppliers and instead of doing security

125
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:53,219
they were spending about a third of the

126
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,500
time in discussions and escalations with

127
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,030
their suppliers because the supplier

128
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,360
didn't oh and now I have to comply with

129
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,719
this and you change that what happens

130
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,389
now

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,880
so all those all those details if you

132
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:09,180
put them in the contract they're going

133
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:15,000
to sell save you a lot of headaches down

134
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:17,520
the road and I mentioned a diversion

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,289
that we should specify the version but

136
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,539
what happens when the policy actually

137
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:28,560
changes and who pays for those changes

138
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:30,690
it's something again that you don't see

139
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,599
mentioned very clearly very often in the

140
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,120
in the contract and you need to to have

141
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,130
some agreement beforehand you have to at

142
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,680
least say that you'll have a process and

143
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,820
describe roughly how is going to be

144
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,090
decided

145
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:53,190
pays for for the case when a policy

146
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:57,450
changes sometimes changes in in security

147
00:06:53,190 --> 00:07:01,400
policies can be quite equally I remember

148
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:03,930
again a real-life case where a company

149
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,729
decided as one does after a good

150
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,770
security incident to upgrade their

151
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,530
security and part of that let's update

152
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:14,060
our security policies and they created

153
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:17,880
this very elaborate very labor-intensive

154
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,530
process for risk management all the

155
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,780
projects had to create very extensive

156
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,460
documentation to to assess the risk and

157
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:28,260
to go through many steps of approvals

158
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:33,270
but that also meant that their suppliers

159
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:36,750
had to spend a lot more hours to follow

160
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,909
that new security process and of course

161
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,550
the supplier said yeah these are extra

162
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,500
hours but now we have it in the contract

163
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,190
that we have to follow my policies we

164
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,320
have them and those discussions back and

165
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:52,140
forth with with vendors and with the

166
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,710
customers they're never easy especially

167
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:59,430
when they are about the money disputes

168
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,710
about who pays what and when if you have

169
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,020
them after the contract is signed they

170
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,700
tend to leave to very strained relations

171
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,890
between the vendors if you have some

172
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,930
clarity upfront and everybody knows what

173
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:14,400
to expect that's that's something that

174
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:18,750
will help you a lot down the road but

175
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,739
let's say you have we have done that you

176
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,630
have listed in your contract which which

177
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,460
policies are applicable diversions and

178
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:31,770
all that what I also see happening very

179
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,189
often and I've been guilty of that as

180
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:38,699
well many times did somebody actually

181
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,840
read those policies and the number of

182
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,460
cases where I've seen I've seen

183
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,810
companies getting into contracts and

184
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:51,720
yeah we will follow those policies is

185
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,900
incredibly high and it can be very very

186
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,680
expensive and it shouldn't be because

187
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,709
especially with large

188
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,779
contracts we have this usually this

189
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:03,060
phase called due diligence and that's

190
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,399
actually very good time to learn about

191
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,969
your business partners security policies

192
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:13,080
it's part of getting to know your your

193
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:16,589
supplier and and the vendors and you

194
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,260
should really make it a habit a standard

195
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:21,899
step in your in your process to go

196
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,580
through those security policies and make

197
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,970
sure that people who actually understand

198
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,860
the security policies read them because

199
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,420
if a commercial guy will be this will

200
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,370
read the security policies they might

201
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:39,360
not understand the implications and

202
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:41,490
realize a real-life story so a company

203
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,130
decides to outsource their

204
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:48,959
infrastructure and they make a bid and

205
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,029
company wins and they start working on

206
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,680
the project this is how we're going to

207
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:54,240
create your new infrastructure this is

208
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,029
how we're going to move things to the

209
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,950
cloud they spend about three months on

210
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:02,820
the on the design phase

211
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:05,040
they have very large about twenty twenty

212
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,830
engineers and architects in the in the

213
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,319
team they come to present the the draft

214
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:13,920
of of the new architecture to the

215
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,230
customer and the security guys look yes

216
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,650
yeah in the security policies we have a

217
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,690
very clear requirement about everything

218
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:25,589
has to be done using the microscope

219
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:31,440
micro segmentation principle your design

220
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:36,510
doesn't do that why those are three

221
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,370
months thrown down the drain the the

222
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,839
loss just from that very simple mistake

223
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,350
was somewhere in the high seek the six

224
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,900
digits and actually it was one of the

225
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,890
factor that led to the to the contract

226
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,720
being being scraped very very expensive

227
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,500
mistake and could have been prevented

228
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,480
just by reading the the the security

229
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:03,540
policies that were referred into the

230
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:07,860
into the contract one thing that however

231
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:10,760
I do see being overused in the in

232
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,190
contract it's the famous term best

233
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,010
practices and we see it over and over

234
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,400
again everybody says you know the the

235
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:23,189
customer the supplier will follow the

236
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,050
best practices and you and we commit

237
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,610
ourselves to following the industry best

238
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:32,189
practices yeah it's it's not good enough

239
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,970
when it's a best practice what does that

240
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,440
mean

241
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,570
it actually can mean very different

242
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,120
things to different people and I

243
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:42,180
remember I was in a contract and I'm

244
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,370
dating myself a bit man the best

245
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,150
practice when it comes to cryptography

246
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:50,970
was moving from 1024 bit to 2048-bit

247
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:53,220
encryption and the contract was saying

248
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,810
the supplier shall shall provide our

249
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,900
systems using the best of the best

250
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,000
practice and it was delivered and the

251
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:04,260
security team said no but now the best

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,550
practice is 2048 be okay we have a

253
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,689
different interpretation of the best

254
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:12,180
practice those were complete waste of

255
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,910
three weeks of my of my life that could

256
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,250
have been said saved just by being

257
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,770
specific in the contract what best

258
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,209
practice are we referring to and there

259
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,610
are very good documented ones you have

260
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:26,400
well of us we have Microsoft needs to

261
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:29,640
have a lot of best practice so when you

262
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,010
use that term qualified what is your

263
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,439
source of best practice so we can as

264
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,529
business partners have the same

265
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:41,839
understanding of what is the what is

266
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,839
that business practice that we refer to

267
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:49,500
very closely related to to this case we

268
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:54,029
have the issue with the with the

269
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:57,360
standards and companies have gotten into

270
00:12:54,029 --> 00:13:00,900
not a bad habit of referencing

271
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,940
standards into the into the contract but

272
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:07,949
then they started to kind of overdo it

273
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:11,400
and you see a lot of standards being

274
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:13,979
being referenced actually in many cases

275
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,850
the people writing those contracts don't

276
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,740
really know what the standards refer to

277
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,770
they

278
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,240
they don't know what is just like with

279
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,980
the policies as I was saying earlier

280
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,830
what are the implications of those

281
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,649
standards and regulations also quite

282
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,899
often I see yeah we we say we are going

283
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:38,660
to be compliant with that standard or we

284
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:41,120
require require the services provided to

285
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,579
be compliant with the standard but we

286
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,620
don't specify what is the scope and it

287
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:49,180
matters if you take something like PCI

288
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:52,399
DSS the the standard 4 4 credit card

289
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,589
processing you don't have to be

290
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,120
compliant with your whole infrastructure

291
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:59,420
just with the part that deals with

292
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:05,420
credit card data so scope really really

293
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:08,000
matters and if you are on the supplier

294
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,279
side you might want to make sure that

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,440
before the commercial guys sign off on

296
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,140
the contract you check that you can

297
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,209
actually deliver what that standard

298
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,970
requires I've I've seen I've seen

299
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:22,969
contracts where because the the customer

300
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,100
was requiring the commercial guys just

301
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,510
now let's just put this this standard

302
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,149
reference in there and then the

303
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:33,230
technical guy said yeah actually no we

304
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:35,480
cannot do that we cannot our systems or

305
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,130
our services are not supposed to be

306
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,240
compliant with that standard that the

307
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:43,850
customer is required and on the other

308
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,370
side on the if you are on the customer

309
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,740
side you have to make sure that you

310
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,170
collect from all the stakeholders the

311
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,959
list of the standards and regulations

312
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,939
that they need this new systems to be

313
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:58,609
there to be compliant with talk with

314
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:01,279
everybody what do you need what are you

315
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,070
supposed to be compliant with and make

316
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:08,270
sure that this is brought into the into

317
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:11,660
the fall into the the contract and real

318
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:15,319
a real life story I was in a in a

319
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,750
contract where a company was quite happy

320
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,630
to get into the Swiss banking market so

321
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:25,490
they got they were the happy receivers

322
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:28,089
of a contract where a Swiss bank decided

323
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:32,280
to outsource their IT services to them

324
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:34,110
brilliant they put the standard

325
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,240
we're going to follow this requirement

326
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:40,650
and there there was a reference to the

327
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:43,680
to some Swiss banking standards what

328
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:48,060
they didn't read very carefully was that

329
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,939
in Switzerland any any system that is

330
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:54,989
handling banking information can only be

331
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:59,010
operated in country by by people being

332
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:00,510
physically there the supplier made the

333
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,760
whole business model and that's why they

334
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,280
were able to to win the bid by a large

335
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,330
margin they based their whole business

336
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:12,449
model on delivering the service from

337
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:15,690
from a much cheaper country that whole

338
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:18,450
model was blown out of the water and

339
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:22,020
they end up taking a huge loss because

340
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,760
now they had to hire people locally at

341
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:27,060
ten times the cost that they were

342
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,880
initially planning and planning to that

343
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,349
that's why we need to understand the

344
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,750
standards that we were getting into we

345
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,670
is they're not just some random letters

346
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,680
that we throw in into the contracts they

347
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:45,270
have meaning and they have implications

348
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:47,219
and remember that those regulations do

349
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,439
change from time to time just like we

350
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,620
were talking earlier with the with the

351
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,990
policies what happens when a policy

352
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,930
change when the standard change and they

353
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,570
had those changes happen we had a new

354
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,319
version of PCI DSS coming in recently we

355
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,319
had gdpr

356
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,089
breaking into the into the world and

357
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,560
that created a lot of back-and-forth

358
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,260
discussions between customers and

359
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,629
vendors you know NIT it would really

360
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,180
help if we begin to put into the

361
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,730
contracts some clauses about how do we

362
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,069
deal with those changes what what is the

363
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:23,640
standard negotiation process and who is

364
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:26,339
usually or by default responsible to

365
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:31,730
cover the those cost have their clarity

366
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:34,260
into the contract and when we talk about

367
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,660
contracts contracts are of course a lot

368
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,250
about trust Europe entrusting your

369
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:42,600
business partner based based on the

370
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:45,210
signed contract to do something yeah but

371
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,939
in business just like Santa Claus you

372
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,799
know Santa Clau

373
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,720
doesn't just try a bit he checks the

374
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,960
list twice we have to do the same with

375
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,379
the with the business partners we have

376
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,720
to to avoid situation surprises in

377
00:17:56,379 --> 00:18:01,539
security because security is definitely

378
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,990
one area where you do not want surprises

379
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:08,259
you really want to know what what you

380
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,450
get and how how do you do that how can

381
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:14,230
you know what are what are you getting

382
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:17,519
so first of all you should put some

383
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:21,250
reporting requirements into the contract

384
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:24,039
you should say how exactly are you going

385
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,860
to measure the the security and I know

386
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:31,029
it's boring management stuff defining

387
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:32,740
KPIs and SLA is for security but it's

388
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:35,169
not impossible and it's not that hard

389
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:39,279
and you can find very good books out

390
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:42,309
there there's pragmatic security matrix

391
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:45,039
highly highly recommended which teaches

392
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,870
you how and it gives you a very long

393
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,539
list of predefined metrics that you can

394
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,428
use in your contracts and it helps you

395
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:59,289
to identify which metrics are relevant

396
00:18:51,429 --> 00:19:02,139
for services use those don't don't just

397
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:04,690
trust use the trust but verify principle

398
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:06,580
which means put some some requirements

399
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,350
in the contract about how are you going

400
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,070
to audit how are you going to test that

401
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:15,070
the services are being delivered at the

402
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:18,100
at the quality you want basically it

403
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,918
comes down to defining for each of those

404
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:24,428
things the answer to three questions who

405
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:27,159
how and how often who is going to do

406
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:30,429
Matt the measurement how often is going

407
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,470
to do it and how is it going going to be

408
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:34,620
communicated to you and to give you an

409
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,149
example you could have a metric about

410
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,360
something very simple the coverage of

411
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:44,289
the antivirus and then it can put in the

412
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:47,678
contract or in the in the Esso double

413
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:51,580
you can put a very simple requirement

414
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:57,490
that I want the the operations manager

415
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:59,110
to email me once a month the report with

416
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,510
the antivirus coverage

417
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,539
it can be stated as simple as that and

418
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,789
you can do this for any security aspect

419
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:09,580
that you are covering in that contract

420
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:14,408
so this way you actually know and can

421
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:16,870
prove what you are getting and I was

422
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:19,090
talking about yeah you have to to

423
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,969
mention pen tests and audits but you

424
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,830
also have to be to put some fences

425
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,880
around that and to put some some

426
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:30,039
qualifications because as as the

427
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,230
supplier you don't want to be audited

428
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:37,570
every month and that's why in the

429
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:41,019
contract it's a good idea and I still

430
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:43,779
don't see that happen happening for my

431
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:46,000
list for very few cases you have to put

432
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:49,539
things like what is the allowed

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,080
frequency of audits and pen test very

434
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:56,408
simple we like we agreed to two audits

435
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,590
per year how many of ours am I supposed

436
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:03,220
to do as a supplier to support your

437
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:06,850
audit yeah I'm going to support you for

438
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,679
free for 100 hours of audit per year if

439
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,469
you want to do more extensive audits

440
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:16,360
absolutely fine here's how much it's

441
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:20,049
going to cost you be very clear with the

442
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:23,320
rules about pen tests be very specific

443
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:25,418
are you is your business partner allowed

444
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,408
to pen test your production system or

445
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:31,179
just the development system or the QA

446
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:33,610
what kind of fantastic methods are

447
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:36,039
allowed or not allowed what kind of pen

448
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,110
testers are we allowed to use are we

449
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:40,720
going to just hire everybody or am I

450
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:43,389
going to say not you can you can audit

451
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,899
me but only with the certified auditing

452
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:49,269
company or pen testers they have they

453
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:51,820
have to be they have have at least these

454
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:55,570
kind of certifications be specific

455
00:21:51,820 --> 00:22:00,070
because although otherwise things can go

456
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:04,149
very wrong real life real life story I

457
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,639
was I was in a company and they didn't

458
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:09,070
they were working on a new owner new

459
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:12,418
agreement and the prospective customer

460
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:15,960
wanted to do a pen test beef

461
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:18,779
or they bought the software so they

462
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,749
signed a pre a pre-contract and they

463
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:25,470
weren't quite clear about where the pen

464
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:27,989
the pen tester can can go to so the pen

465
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:32,279
tester as a good one does went for the

466
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:34,320
production system and he got access the

467
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:37,369
problem was that the system that he got

468
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,279
access to was a system that was holding

469
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:44,399
real-life court cases information he got

470
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:47,299
access to as sensitive information as

471
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:52,258
you can get and he should not have ever

472
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:56,009
seen though those kind of details so

473
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:57,749
that's why you want to be to be clear in

474
00:22:56,009 --> 00:23:04,289
the contract about in situations like

475
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:07,919
that and also some you also want to put

476
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:10,169
some clauses about what is the other

477
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,269
party allowed to do the with the results

478
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:15,570
of the audits or the pen test so if they

479
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:17,759
pen test you and they find something can

480
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,908
they just go to the and published in the

481
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,830
press or maybe you want to have in the

482
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:24,919
in the contract some clauses saying yeah

483
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:32,340
if you find something you let me know

484
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:34,769
not the New York Post and don't forget

485
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,168
as we have nowadays so many so many

486
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:39,749
systems that are in the cloud that have

487
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:42,119
share tenancy there they tend to be

488
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:45,919
quite tricky but what can you do and not

489
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:50,070
do if you have something in sure or in

490
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,869
or in aw yes you cannot just go and pen

491
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,450
test the whole thing I mean if even if

492
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:56,129
your system is there there was a third

493
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,899
party that you hired to the pen testing

494
00:23:56,129 --> 00:24:00,629
hand it has to be aware and has to have

495
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:02,340
clear rules about what tests are allowed

496
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:05,988
or not so you don't breach your own

497
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:10,738
contract with with the cloud supplier

498
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:14,609
and many of these security issues with

499
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:16,619
the contracts are very are very

500
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:18,840
important especially for outsourcing

501
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:21,749
because with our sourcing you're really

502
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,999
giving a lot of your control a lot of

503
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:26,020
your infrastructure to to somebody else

504
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:28,570
and

505
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,090
with the with the outsourcing contracts

506
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,189
and security it's very important to know

507
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,799
exactly where you're starting so what is

508
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:38,559
the security stages what is the security

509
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:43,139
baseline of the system when you're

510
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:47,350
outsourcing it and when there are issues

511
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:49,630
you have to agree in the contract how

512
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,399
long is it going to take to solve them

513
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:54,460
and also who is going to pay for you can

514
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:56,830
you should put some things like well I'm

515
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,230
outsourcing the system but if if

516
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,059
vulnerabilities are found within the six

517
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,610
within the first six months of the

518
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:06,129
contract then I'm still going to pay for

519
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:09,399
them because I owned the system before

520
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:13,630
I'm responsible for those for those

521
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:15,549
issues real a real life story a company

522
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,610
decided to outsource their software

523
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:21,639
development and that's yeah we have

524
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,110
excellent code here it is now you you

525
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,850
take it over and you're responsible for

526
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:30,789
it it was then discovered that actually

527
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:33,789
that software was full of security holes

528
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:36,250
that were quite expensive to fix because

529
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:40,299
they require a lot of man-hours they

530
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:43,409
require reengineering a whole very big

531
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:46,149
part of the of the application and

532
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:49,270
because they because the party to which

533
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:51,428
this the development was outsourced to

534
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:55,200
they didn't put clauses like that in the

535
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:58,090
contract they ended up paying and

536
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,760
killing their their profit for mistakes

537
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:03,939
that their customer has actually done in

538
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,010
the past that's that's not good business

539
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,570
and if I'm on the outsourcing party I'm

540
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:11,080
going to take that loss but I'm going to

541
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:14,168
make sure that I'm going to to really

542
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,178
hard try to repair it that money and how

543
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:18,190
can I do that I can do it by providing

544
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:19,390
you less less services and it skimping

545
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,390
on the on the quality down the road

546
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:24,549
because I have to make a living as well

547
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:26,890
so we had take take that baseline and

548
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:30,010
have the agreements on how do you deal

549
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:33,520
with things that were wrong before the

550
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:37,320
outsourcing happened and also make sure

551
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,370
that it is clearly understood and agreed

552
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,260
who is going to have the secure

553
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,100
responsibility after the after the

554
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,180
outsourcing is it still going to be the

555
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,459
customer responsibility through their

556
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:51,220
security team is it going to be now the

557
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,670
responsibility of the new party make it

558
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:57,100
explicit if it can work other way but it

559
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:59,460
has a cost implication it has a resource

560
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:05,740
implication so that's why you need the

561
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:08,980
clarity and we talk about control and

562
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:13,690
and again especially in the context of

563
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:15,460
of outsourcing you are giving up access

564
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:19,270
to your systems to the infrastructure

565
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:22,210
you have to be clear what rules apply to

566
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:24,129
those access I mean if you if you're not

567
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:28,480
clear you don't you're losing control

568
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:30,220
and be very explicit about things like

569
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,400
the kind of data that it's allowed to be

570
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,460
accessed if you have intellectual

571
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,380
property where is it and who can see it

572
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:43,179
and who doesn't from your from your

573
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:45,540
business partners have very very clear

574
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:47,830
rules about using administrative

575
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,500
privileges and about access to

576
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:53,320
production systems for example if

577
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,990
outsourcing develop software development

578
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,090
will the developers from that third

579
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,250
party have access to your production

580
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:03,490
databases actually in most cases they

581
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:06,370
shouldn't so you should explain put that

582
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,720
explicitly into the contract and have a

583
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,399
procedure in place say yeah

584
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,250
if you really need to you have to go

585
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:15,660
through this approval process and that's

586
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:19,450
the only way that you can get access

587
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:22,510
also especially if you give access to

588
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,730
sensitive systems to to high level

589
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,590
privileges you can you can put some

590
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,270
requirements about what are the minimum

591
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,520
qualification that the people should

592
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,710
have when they touch your systems don't

593
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,510
hesitate to put requirements about you

594
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,280
should have background checks and I've

595
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:38,890
been in contracted with air with

596
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,740
airports where it was very clearly

597
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:45,130
specified anybody touching my IT systems

598
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:49,780
has has to have a police background

599
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:52,179
check no old no older than a year you

600
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,020
you need to put those and it's it's

601
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:57,909
quite

602
00:28:53,020 --> 00:29:01,720
quite advisable as access to production

603
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:07,559
data it keeps being ignored and a lot of

604
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:11,039
production level accessing that what

605
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,039
that was not me

606
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,919
all right let's try to go without oh

607
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,449
that's all and yeah Jason thanks a lot

608
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:27,640
for the tip that things will go wrong

609
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:29,020
yeah that that helps yeah right so I was

610
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,880
trusting him I bet I didn't have a

611
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,418
closed room what happens when when

612
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,830
things go wrong technically yeah

613
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:38,159
organizers let's update the contract for

614
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:42,850
next year

615
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:45,940
and speaking of access to production and

616
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:48,730
to sensitive sensitive information put

617
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,890
some rules in there by taking again the

618
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,770
example with giving access to production

619
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:56,860
database put a clause in the contract

620
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:59,830
that whenever that access is used it

621
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,779
should be recorded and I should I as the

622
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:04,870
owner of that production system I should

623
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:07,330
receive once a month the report with how

624
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,250
many times the admin access was used so

625
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,129
I can have that traceability because I

626
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,570
might discover this guys are I thought

627
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,190
that they are occasionally accessing my

628
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,490
production database no they actually

629
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:20,880
have 3,000 people accessing the

630
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:26,890
production database on a daily basis

631
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:28,630
why so monitoring of of of the access

632
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,370
control that's quite quite important and

633
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:35,590
you want to specify that into the

634
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:37,120
contract and of course another part

635
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,279
important part of the contract which

636
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,739
still tends to be overlooked when it

637
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:46,360
comes to security is liability and

638
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,580
liability is basically how do you deal

639
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,360
with situations when things go wrong and

640
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:54,928
they do go wrong I we've been in IT long

641
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:59,979
enough to know that things do go wrong

642
00:30:54,929 --> 00:31:04,270
so we want to be clear and upfront what

643
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,410
happens then who pay who pays who goes

644
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,170
to court

645
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:12,070
and of course vendors don't like to take

646
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:14,230
liability it's everybody tries to do the

647
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:17,470
best for their side of the deal so it's

648
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,870
up to they up to the customers to ask

649
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:23,680
for those things to prove those clauses

650
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:28,270
into the into the contract real real

651
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:31,410
life story it was a security contract

652
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:34,560
and they they hired a pen tester and

653
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:37,900
different than the pen tester before

654
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,210
gagas gets to work and he's quite it

655
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,580
young and enthusiastic and quad quite

656
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,610
good at what he does and he manages to

657
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:49,929
drop the whole production database just

658
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:52,750
because as you can imagine when when you

659
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:54,790
are a company with the public presence

660
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,910
and your production database goes down

661
00:31:54,790 --> 00:32:00,760
on a web-based system that's not going

662
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:02,530
to make for good business who is

663
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,300
responsible there who is going to pay

664
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,320
for the damages do we have something in

665
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,560
the contract

666
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,870
that's that says if you are the

667
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,540
customers and their supplier you broke

668
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,850
my system please compensate me if you

669
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,310
are on via on the other side do you have

670
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:22,480
something to to put some limitations on

671
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:26,350
what kind of damages can be can be put

672
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:29,560
on your plate you should also look what

673
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,540
kind of liabilities you can transfer

674
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,610
with cyber insurance both as a customer

675
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:37,360
and especially as a supplier you might

676
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:39,610
want to you might want to take cyber

677
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,020
insurance to protect you from issues

678
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:43,419
that you might cause to your to your

679
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,680
customer and for us in security if we

680
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:49,420
provide security services that's

681
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:51,250
something very advisable I've seen quite

682
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,560
a few cases where security companies

683
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:56,170
screw up things because it happens and

684
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,000
if you have a clear contract on how to

685
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:00,970
deal and deal with that it makes a lot

686
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,060
of a difference and also have a good

687
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:06,040
understanding of what can you what kind

688
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,860
of liability can or can't you transfer

689
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:12,190
and take the GDP our example with GDP

690
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:14,020
are you can only transfer a very limited

691
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,720
amount of that liability because at the

692
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,299
end of the day you are still the main

693
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,429
responsible if there is a data

694
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,820
caused by one of your suppliers you

695
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:27,129
still the one who is going to pay that

696
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,600
that big fine and go and have to notify

697
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:32,678
the authorities

698
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:37,988
that's a liability you cannot you cannot

699
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:41,499
transfer and in general try to avoid

700
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:44,470
assumptions assumptions are interesting

701
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:48,220
in movies and not not in real life not

702
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:51,489
in not in security we have to be clear

703
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:55,210
and explicit with especially with with

704
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:57,239
security because it's it's nice to

705
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:00,119
assume that things will go will go well

706
00:33:57,239 --> 00:34:03,249
but you really want to know what's

707
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:05,168
what's going to happen and to take

708
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:11,168
another example from from the

709
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:14,500
outsourcing life the company that that

710
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:17,348
took over that development contract also

711
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,199
may didn't think about who is going to

712
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:22,690
be responsible for security and they

713
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,509
just assumed that the customer will

714
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:29,500
maintain their big existing and very

715
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:31,450
very strong security team actually after

716
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,960
the outsourcing contract was signed the

717
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:36,808
the company said yeah ok we're going to

718
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,190
scale down our security team because now

719
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:42,309
they're outsourcing party you are

720
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:44,559
responsible that's another assumption

721
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:48,970
that went very wrong in a very expensive

722
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:50,200
way and don't forget just because even

723
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,118
just because if it's written in the

724
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:54,908
contract don't just assume is going to

725
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:58,150
be delivered make sure that you have

726
00:34:54,909 --> 00:35:00,640
ways agreed in the contract on how to

727
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:05,910
check that those services are actually

728
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:09,150
being being delivered and those were

729
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:14,500
let's say the main issues that I've seen

730
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:17,109
now are they all there are there are

731
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,089
many other contractual scenes I try to

732
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:21,400
keep it to 10 to make it the Decalogue

733
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:24,400
yet there are more but if we can solve

734
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,930
at least those that would be that good

735
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,680
step forward and I'm just going to very

736
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,848
quickly suddenly summarize them make

737
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,009
sure that you have security in the

738
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:34,630
contract make sure that we

739
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:37,870
you refer to policies they are well

740
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:40,810
described make sure you are ready for

741
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:42,880
change in the contract make sure that

742
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:46,990
you actually read those security

743
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,790
policies that you signed on do not use

744
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,290
them they at the term best practice

745
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:55,150
unless you are referring to something

746
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:57,070
very explicit and quantifiable make sure

747
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:59,190
that all the standards and regulations

748
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:01,570
which are referred in your contract are

749
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:05,880
well understood in terms of implications

750
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:08,530
for you as both customer and an vendor

751
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,810
make sure that you can measure the

752
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,890
compliance of the of those security

753
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:15,850
requirements that you put in the

754
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:19,180
contract put some limitations to audits

755
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:21,370
and and pen tests make sure that if

756
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:24,310
you're in outsourcing contract take a

757
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:28,270
baseline of the security level at the

758
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:30,220
time of outsourcing when you give access

759
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:32,200
rights make sure that they are all the

760
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:36,879
fan well defended and it's very clear

761
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:39,339
who can do what don't forget to put live

762
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,760
clear liability clauses in the contract

763
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:46,630
and in general just don't make

764
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,070
assumptions and next to to those and by

765
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,950
the way Rob I think the slides will be

766
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:52,900
on on the side of the conference you can

767
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,450
feel free to use that share it with your

768
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,400
commercial team you can even take my

769
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,529
name out if it's if you don't want to

770
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,660
give attribution

771
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:04,570
these are important rules that would

772
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:07,600
save companies quite a lot of money in

773
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:10,540
time and next to those things which I've

774
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,750
learned them really the hard way there

775
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:16,810
are a few more things that I learned

776
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:19,840
first of all as we all know yeah no need

777
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:22,600
to detail on that one but on a more

778
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,990
serious note another thing that I got to

779
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,640
learn and I valued a lot value it a lot

780
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:29,770
nowadays is that security is not about

781
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,740
security security is not about

782
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:36,070
technology security is about the

783
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,149
business we are there to not to just

784
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,700
because we want to do something fun

785
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:41,530
there's that but we are there as

786
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:44,200
security professionals because we want

787
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,510
and we have to defend our companies our

788
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,879
organizations so we have to

789
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:51,700
work with that we really have to get

790
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,850
into the habit of supporting the

791
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:57,370
business of being partners with them and

792
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:59,950
that's kind of a culture change that we

793
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:02,170
can either drive ourselves and be the

794
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,629
leaders with that or we can just wait

795
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:07,330
for somebody else to push it to push it

796
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:12,400
on us and maybe not in the way that we'd

797
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:14,290
have liked it and when you do get into

798
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,580
the habit of being involved into

799
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:21,040
contract management as a security

800
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:23,650
professional in your organization make

801
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,029
sure that you do that not just because

802
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:27,010
it has to be done but with a good

803
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:29,710
understanding that it will save you time

804
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,870
down the road if you spend a bit of time

805
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:35,140
in the beginning it will save you time

806
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:39,910
in escalations that are this way avoided

807
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:42,250
and be mindful of the timelines of the

808
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,319
of the guys in the on the contracting

809
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,270
side it's good to have security

810
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,880
requirements if you bring them to the

811
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:51,009
commercial guys the the day before the

812
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,690
contract signing then they're not going

813
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,130
to help you to to get those security

814
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,680
requirements into the contract

815
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:59,620
understand the the the financial

816
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:04,240
commercial processes and align yourself

817
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:06,490
to that and remember that the best

818
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,370
contract and I've seen that from both

819
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:11,140
sides of the fence quite quite a lot the

820
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,660
best contract that contracts that I've

821
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,910
witnessed were the ones where all the

822
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,680
parties that were stake holder than that

823
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,750
that were using or depending on those

824
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,910
systems we were actually involved in

825
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,160
those contract negotiations where each

826
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:27,819
stakeholder really had a voice it's

827
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,819
really consulted and have less surprises

828
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:34,180
down the road and for us as security

829
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,980
guiding we we have sometimes a tendency

830
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,740
of saying oh this is management work

831
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,720
this is contract work it's I don't like

832
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,120
this it's it's actually something that

833
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,339
we are very familiar with at the end of

834
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,140
the day is just another form of threat

835
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,680
modeling something that we are very good

836
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,870
at it's about yeah let's think how could

837
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,750
this go wrong and let's see what can we

838
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:58,720
put in that contract to make to make it

839
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,070
go better it's all it is and we are

840
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,129
really good at it

841
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:04,900
so that was the that was the talk thank

842
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:17,560
thanks a lot for the attention and if

843
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:19,450
you have any questions please keep your

844
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:30,970
hand up so he knows where to go with

845
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:33,460
this homing missile and microphone how

846
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:36,100
do you actually determine what including

847
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:40,330
the claws like to include the maximum

848
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:43,120
amount for the contractor to let's say

849
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:50,650
placing the policy the insurance policy

850
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:53,170
do you have any carve outs or the policy

851
00:40:50,650 --> 00:41:01,240
has to cover because insurance companies

852
00:40:53,170 --> 00:41:04,210
may have a limit on the amount yes and

853
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,819
that's why it's one important to talk

854
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,830
with your insurance company to

855
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,260
understand those limitations so you know

856
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:13,090
what are you covered for or not what are

857
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,920
the limits what are the exclusions and

858
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:19,540
then it's important to take that and

859
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,340
cascade it translate it into the

860
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,620
contract clauses as well so they so they

861
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:26,470
match so you don't have a requirement in

862
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:30,279
the contract that which is not covered

863
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:32,770
by the by the cyber insurance and it's

864
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:36,220
difficult to give a clear-cut answer

865
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:37,990
because they they are very much contract

866
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,029
dependent so you have to to look at the

867
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:42,910
service that is that is being delivered

868
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,310
what are the possible negative

869
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:48,370
implications of that and what can be

870
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:51,160
covered I think the best advice I can

871
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:52,960
give on that one is really talk with the

872
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,670
with the subject cyber insurance party

873
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,340
and get their their advice and their

874
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:59,620
clarity and then work with with your

875
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:02,650
legal department in the contract and

876
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:05,080
make and get their opinion to see if

877
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,910
they agree that those two match what's

878
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:11,200
in the insurance and what is in the in

879
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:13,259
the contract all right I'm gonna I'm

880
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,069
gonna take a question here now

881
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:20,250
so hi Sebastian what's your advice in

882
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:24,599
cases a contract it's already signed and

883
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:27,210
running and what would you advise

884
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:31,260
someone in case the contract was not

885
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:34,339
following the rules that you said to

886
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:36,839
change it or to make it towards a better

887
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:40,799
better specified line that's it like

888
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:43,109
that good good question and yeah we all

889
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,839
work in companies that had contracts

890
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:47,009
that were signed years ago before they

891
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,839
actually had a chance to see my

892
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:51,960
presentation and they don't know how to

893
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:53,578
do it better but for those of those

894
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,550
situations first step

895
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:58,920
talk to your procurement Department or

896
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:02,040
whatever believe the department that

897
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,950
handles those contracts because even

898
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:08,220
though the the kind of issues that you

899
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:09,540
have to fix are more in the security

900
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,419
domain and then might not understand

901
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:14,339
those they do understand how to change

902
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:17,819
contracts that's what that's what they

903
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:19,890
do so just go to them go to your to your

904
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:21,900
business partners there and say this are

905
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,578
the issues explain them in terms of

906
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,220
risks to the companies because that's

907
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:29,190
what the especially the legal guys want

908
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,939
to understand and say I'm trying to

909
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:35,369
protect the company from these risks and

910
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,050
let them tell you how to solve that we

911
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:40,730
we're not supposed to know everything

912
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:43,230
and this this are just a few ideas that

913
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:45,270
we don't but we don't do those on

914
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,910
ourselves contracts especially in large

915
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,859
organizations those are a really big

916
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:53,040
team effort you have procurement guys

917
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:54,810
you have legal legal guys they all have

918
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,819
to work to work together and this is

919
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,819
this is the part where we need to work

920
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:02,009
just as we work just as we learned over

921
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:04,020
time to as security professionals to

922
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:06,599
work more closely with IT and

923
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,790
development we have just have to turn

924
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,619
around and apply those learning about

925
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:12,619
collaboration with the commercial guys

926
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:20,328
are there any more questions one at the

927
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,328
back

928
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:33,059
hi was really nice presentation and to

929
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:36,359
be honest I think that I would really

930
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:39,030
like to see in the real world a contract

931
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:41,250
that satisfies all that criteria meter

932
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:45,150
I've never seen it and I worked in like

933
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:48,900
many companies and what I would like to

934
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:52,859
ask is that is very nice to have let's

935
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:55,349
say guidelines and to know exactly what

936
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:57,299
you have to follow but don't you think

937
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:58,559
it defeats a little bit the purpose

938
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,099
especially when you're doing the

939
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,839
security audit for example because their

940
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:06,000
article hackers and the hackers in

941
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,970
general I don't think that if you

942
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:14,190
monitor them or if you put them all kind

943
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:16,770
of limits they can get you exactly what

944
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:18,599
you actually want it because the mindset

945
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,540
when you're doing a security audit is

946
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:24,240
actually to look for flaws that a normal

947
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,009
IT guy wouldn't look right so the more

948
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,029
you like him the more you say you're

949
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:31,829
only allowed to walk on this path a

950
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:34,290
little bit it defeats the purpose and

951
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,970
that's why there are these bounty

952
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:39,089
programs where let's say they have a

953
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:43,470
little bit more space to to be creative

954
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:46,230
no absolutely so I fully agree with the

955
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:49,319
fact that when we put limits on

956
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:50,430
pentesting this is as the customer of

957
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:52,770
that pen test I'm actually shooting

958
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:54,750
myself in the foot because I'm not

959
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,460
getting maybe the quality and this is

960
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,490
not what I'm advocating so I'm not

961
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,349
saying by having clear contracts that we

962
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,540
should limit quite the opposite and and

963
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:06,839
thank you actually gave me the very good

964
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,839
example what what is one very good thing

965
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:14,009
about Bob bug bounty programs is that

966
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:15,420
they have that clear clarity and this is

967
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,700
what we have to learn it's not about

968
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,040
just putting limits is really about

969
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,899
being clear and defining this is what's

970
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,930
allowed and not allowed without having

971
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,549
there be ambiguity and if we want to

972
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,919
allow more and we should allow more pen

973
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:31,020
testing yes we can cap we can still

974
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,730
capture that in the contract with with

975
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,670
the rules we can have clear rules about

976
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:38,550
liabilities again that the bug bounties

977
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:41,550
were very good at say

978
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:44,040
mitigating that problem where it wasn't

979
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:46,410
quite clear if I'm a hacker and I break

980
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,509
into into a company am I going to jail

981
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,040
am I going to get a nasty letter from a

982
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:53,640
lawyer how we're going to build that and

983
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:57,029
that exactly what those bug bounty

984
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:59,129
problems program solved by having clear

985
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,440
contract your requirements with the

986
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:04,230
security researchers and with the

987
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,870
companies and advising them both how to

988
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,500
do it from contractual perspective in a

989
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,529
good way

990
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:13,040
