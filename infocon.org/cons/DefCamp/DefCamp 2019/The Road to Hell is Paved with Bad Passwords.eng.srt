1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,600
so as we take our seats so this is a

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,450
very interesting incident that I managed

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,620
and negotiated and found a resolution

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,690
for and give you a bit of a background

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,230
about me because many of you might not

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:23,029
know much about me I actually started

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,859
out very young younger than B ahir I was

8
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:28,259
actually in computers starting from

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,289
around the age of five and unfortunately

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,940
at the age of ten I was busted for

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,910
breaking into the Department of Justice

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,390
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:42,000
so after I was 18 and I was allowed to

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,170
use a computer again the US Air Force so

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,070
kindly recruited me and started using my

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:52,440
specific talents for them in the various

17
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,289
ways I also was a military aviator and

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,260
worked for Space Command and my previous

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,590
role I headed digital security for IT

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:06,390
IOT and ICS systems for the Saudi Aramco

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,729
family across amia and Latin America so

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,770
where it was located for the Aramco

23
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,740
family my office was in The Hague the

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,500
Netherlands and one day I was eating

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,060
lunch which was pretty rare because I

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,409
did a lot of things for Ramco including

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,720
heading the joint international

28
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,280
intelligence team the Security

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,650
Operations Center and the network

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,530
operation center so I almost never got a

31
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,280
chance to eat lunch but this day it was

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,860
a special day I know it's coun into some

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,229
spinach salad and I was having a great

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,780
time until a very large man and a very

35
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,049
nice tailored suit stepped up to me and

36
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,670
he says mister Becca there's a problem

37
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,020
and I go uh what kind of problem is this

38
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:52,259
and he goes come with me

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,530
so I had been summoned by this gentleman

40
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,509
who took me into our empties office and

41
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,060
said we need to get you to the Saudi

42
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,729
Arabian embassy immediately they've been

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,710
hacked Saudi Arabian embassy wasn't too

44
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,600
far away from my office so I'm like okay

45
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,310
let me see what I can do let me take my

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,220
forensics person with me

47
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:16,660
and when we got there it was very

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:20,260
interesting because it started out with

49
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:23,260
an email hack and grew all the way to

50
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,440
the point where a terrorist group tried

51
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,870
to extort the city it was so bad that

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,790
the Embassy of Saudi Arabia and several

53
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,860
other embassies in The Hague actually

54
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,170
put a disclaimer on their website to

55
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,800
warn them that there was something going

56
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:41,260
on in The Hague with their embassies and

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,260
it also included the Dutch national

58
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,319
terrorism police and it spread to every

59
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:50,980
embassy with a business email on the

60
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,359
backend so one of the reasons why I was

61
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,640
chosen was because I'd already been

62
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,069
doing a whole bunch for the Saudi Aramco

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,569
family and it was myself and my team

64
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:02,170
that actually reconnected business

65
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:04,329
operations in 2013 after they were the

66
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,220
victim of the world's worst cyber

67
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,630
warfare attack when the Iranians hit

68
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,209
them with a piece of malware called

69
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,430
Shamoon and that piece of malware was a

70
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,980
wiper piece of malware and it knocked

71
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,320
out 85% of their windows-based computer

72
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,890
systems it also took out to oil

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,690
production facilities at the time and it

74
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,238
basically stopped their business

75
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,940
operations completely they were back to

76
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,500
typewriters they could not load petrol

77
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,560
trucks or fuel trucks as you might call

78
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,810
them here the country of Saudi Arabia

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,489
was running out of gasoline so if you

80
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,709
went up to the pump you could not get

81
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,769
any if you called an ambulance the

82
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,329
ambulance had no fuel so I was a trusted

83
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,400
individual with the Saudi Arabian

84
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:48,400
government and the Saudi Aramco family I

85
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,780
also have law-enforcement experience not

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,810
just getting busted by law enforcement

87
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,690
mind you but also dealing with various

88
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:59,019
cyber crimes and being the interface in

89
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,760
those particular investigations and I'm

90
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,739
very good at communicating so I

91
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,769
regularly talk to heads of states and

92
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,480
ministers and so forth later this month

93
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:10,690
I'll be doing two workshops with the

94
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,179
United Nations one on IOT and one on

95
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,389
protecting journalists with reporters

96
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:20,320
without borders now during this time

97
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:22,100
frame we have a right-wing individual in

98
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,400
the Netherlands called Kurt

99
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,100
and he had made a video at the time

100
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,370
where it looked like he was ripping up

101
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,340
the Quran and this angered a lot of the

102
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,800
rest of the world so they also insisted

103
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,380
after I brought my forensics person who

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,500
was Dutch that he had to leave but I

105
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,060
could stay because I'm a US citizen

106
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,430
the Saudi Arabian government also

107
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,500
cancelled bill over a billion euro worth

108
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,030
of contracts of Dutch companies and

109
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,110
kicked a lot of Dutch citizens out of

110
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:56,059
Saudi Arabia during this timeframe so it

111
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,630
ended up only myself handled the case

112
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:02,630
after I arrived now it's another thing

113
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,210
to remember with an Embassy's an embassy

114
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,950
is a piece of a country and that means

115
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,859
that local law enforcement does not

116
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:13,280
apply local laws do not apply the police

117
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,720
are non existent now in the diplomatic

118
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,650
world there is something called the

119
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,990
diplomatic core but they cannot say

120
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,179
openly arrest somebody without causing

121
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,850
an international incident if they have a

122
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,440
diplomatic passport I really miss the

123
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,390
days I traveled on my diplomatic

124
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,060
passport and made things a lot easier

125
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:34,550
and another thing to consider is the

126
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,400
fact that the Ambassador is the leader

127
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:40,070
of that embassy and is in essence the

128
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:45,049
king or queen of that embassy for that

129
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:48,290
country so what we found initially

130
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,580
because we were allowed to do a packet

131
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,200
capture on the network with the

132
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,200
forensics guy before if he was kicked

133
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,510
out was we found a commercial

134
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,640
off-the-shelf piece of malware now

135
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,099
what's interesting about this was we

136
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,750
were able to trace the transaction of

137
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,440
the purchase of the malware when I

138
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,770
solved the case to someone who was

139
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,290
affiliated with the Iranian government

140
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:16,370
now the way that cyber espionage works

141
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:20,930
is a nation-state can spend millions on

142
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,940
some fancy-schmancy apt or if they want

143
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,130
plausible deniability then they will use

144
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,080
commercial off-the-shelf so they it

145
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,520
doesn't look like they immediately did

146
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,169
it and this happened to be the case

147
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,490
unfortunately this also involved an

148
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,530
insider

149
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,229
working or thought he was working

150
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,568
completely for Isis now at the same time

151
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:45,199
we also had another type of an incident

152
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:48,410
I like to say you never forget the first

153
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,050
time you were droned this was my office

154
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:54,830
and blue and in the red was the embassy

155
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,509
of Yemen now Yemen all of a sudden they

156
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,699
decided to purchase the building next to

157
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,009
my office Aramco headquarters of Europe

158
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,289
what's unusual is it was not in the

159
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,539
embassy section at all it was a very

160
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,219
expensive building they were cash poor

161
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:10,759
at the time supposedly the government

162
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:15,139
but they bought it for cash straight up

163
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,639
cash and shortly after they moved in we

164
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,130
started having some problems with the

165
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,289
embassy our good old neighbors we caught

166
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,909
them in our back yard of our property

167
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:26,150
digging in to try to get to our

168
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,469
fiber-optic cable to bend and surveil we

169
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,840
caught several of their employees

170
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,520
pretending to be our employees inside

171
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,440
our building in the cafeteria because we

172
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,859
did not have a proper wall for the

173
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,280
outdoor eating area which we built

174
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,650
shortly afterwards then one day I was

175
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,109
talking to my boss and we happened to be

176
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,960
on the top floor of the building and I

177
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,870
looked behind him facing outside in the

178
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,739
windows and there is a very nice

179
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,139
commercial grade drone well it turns out

180
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,630
the Yemeni embassy decided that they

181
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:02,539
were going to try to surveil us by using

182
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:07,159
drones and flying one two three drones

183
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:09,289
around our building now because local

184
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,800
laws don't apply we couldn't just call

185
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,509
the police

186
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,729
but we had to have the diplomatic corps

187
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:16,159
step in and also the Dutch government

188
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:17,990
explained they could fly the drone over

189
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,789
their own property but it was illegal to

190
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,740
fly it over anyone else's property and

191
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,870
they also had to register the drones as

192
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,060
well if they were to do so because we

193
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,190
actually have very strict drone laws in

194
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,130
the Netherlands so you can't just do

195
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,469
that so finally they stopped but there

196
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,479
were a few other incidents involving the

197
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:42,339
amending embassy as well in some of my

198
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:44,930
direct personnel so when I got there

199
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,350
there was a young man he had just

200
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,329
started that week

201
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,089
he was a bit nervous obviously because

202
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:53,219
here's this big incident and he's saying

203
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,959
well what can I do what can I help you

204
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,690
with I go well listen what happened goes

205
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,810
well there were some suspicious emails

206
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,509
and I think that the email account has

207
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,579
been hacked and I go ok all right so

208
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:07,170
let's get to the bottom of this what is

209
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:10,910
the password for the email account for

210
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:13,050
your embassy one two three four five six

211
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,969
all right how many people think that

212
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:19,620
that's a great password for an embassy

213
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:22,500
right great password for no-one and what

214
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,870
had pique their suspicions was there was

215
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,370
only one person allowed to handle the

216
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,589
embassy emails and that was the

217
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,569
ambassador's secretary it was also the

218
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:35,190
only computer that was supposed to be

219
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:37,709
set up for this system and when a Saudi

220
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:40,110
Arabian national had asked the embassy

221
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:42,000
hey can you help me out with procuring a

222
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,250
visa and this person did not know that

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,100
the Saudi Arabian embassy stopped doing

224
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:51,060
visas they were sent back an email

225
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:54,829
saying hey I can expedite that visa for

226
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:58,979
you if you just give me some money and

227
00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:01,439
so this was the email and what it said

228
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,279
was sure man we can get that visa for

229
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,760
you if you send me two hundred dollars

230
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:10,319
right over to money grant in the name of

231
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,569
the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the

232
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:16,290
United Kingdom who happens to be a

233
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:23,040
prince so this kind of looks suspicious

234
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:26,579
right so from this point it involved

235
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,099
several email events going back and

236
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:32,040
forth where the perpetrator had been

237
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,779
able to get into the email account doing

238
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,959
a man-in-the-middle sending messages

239
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:39,240
back and forth and it was very

240
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,550
unfortunate because it started to get a

241
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:47,430
bit personal during this time frame and

242
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:49,529
the perpetrator attempted to also make

243
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,479
believe that the Saudi Arabian

244
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,639
ambassador to the UK was actually having

245
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,160
an affair with the person who had sent

246
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,050
in the visa request and the person who

247
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,560
sent it in she's a rather controversial

248
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,849
figure

249
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,619
she used to run a lot of Islamic schools

250
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,420
in the United Kingdom that were funded

251
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,560
by the Saudi Arabian government and they

252
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,500
were shut down by the UK government

253
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,439
because of extremist literature that

254
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,960
they were giving to children so they

255
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,680
were trying to start a scandal and a

256
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,760
place where there had not been a scandal

257
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,199
so we locked down the email account

258
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,140
because I'm not a Saudi Arabian citizen

259
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,930
I can only do so much and made a whole

260
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,170
bunch of recommendations and then two

261
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:37,479
weeks later I'm eating lunch and finally

262
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,240
lunch again and then here comes the same

263
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,610
guy very large man in a very nice suit

264
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,310
and says mr. kubecka we have an issue

265
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,890
can you please come with me and I was

266
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,260
like all right you've already done the

267
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,020
embassy thing he doesn't act like a

268
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,430
family member died hopefully they didn't

269
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,480
find out I was mining Bitcoin on

270
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,609
supercomputers but instead it turns out

271
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,480
that the perpetrator still had access

272
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:06,210
somehow to that email account and

273
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:11,260
instead of it being $200 for a visa

274
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:13,810
suddenly it went up to $25,000 signed

275
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,970
Isis and this email was sent from the

276
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,250
Saudi Arabian embassies official

277
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,440
back-channel email account to the rest

278
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:24,280
of the GCC countries in the Middle East

279
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,350
and to Turkey which included Oman which

280
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,449
if you know it much about current

281
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,740
geopolitics Saudi Arabia and Oman are

282
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,230
not friends excuse me

283
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:38,530
Qatar and Saudi Arabia are not friends

284
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:39,460
so second email comes it says hey I'm a

285
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,490
friend

286
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:45,910
you can save many lives by just sending

287
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:48,820
me twenty five thousand dollars signed

288
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,760
Isis I standardized a little bit of it

289
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,810
but it was from Saudi embassy signed

290
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,090
Isis so it's always nice to know who you

291
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,060
working working with right so you know

292
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:04,690
exactly what you might be dealing with

293
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:06,819
now unfortunately the diplomatic corps

294
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:09,760
we're trying to be proactive however

295
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,890
they had no permission whatsoever to

296
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,050
send out any email

297
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,210
regarding this incident this was

298
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,040
supposed to be involving only the Saudi

299
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,540
Arabian embassy and we were using

300
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,699
diplomatic means with the other

301
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,800
embassies including I was already

302
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,720
collecting and evidence from those other

303
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,380
embassies who were giving it to me

304
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,880
freely except for Turkey they did not

305
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,600
and now we all know that they're also

306
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,490
not friends and the diplomatic corps

307
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,370
decided to send a warning email out to

308
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:42,730
every single embassy in The Hague on

309
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:46,110
their official back-office channel to

310
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:48,490
say hey if you get any of these

311
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,340
suspicious emails trying to extort you

312
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,740
for money go ahead and send it to us and

313
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,360
we'll see if we can help you out well

314
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,770
that sounds really cool

315
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,550
except they used CC instead of BCC and

316
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:08,189
the perpetrator was still on the backend

317
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:11,199
so now instead they responded back and

318
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:14,620
also to every single embassy in The

319
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,510
Hague that was included on that CC then

320
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,090
they started taunting the diplomatic

321
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:23,910
corps and saying I'm so glad we have

322
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,910
your attention now the amounts going up

323
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,280
so then it started getting very very

324
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,110
personal now in this case the

325
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,579
perpetrator while I was still trying to

326
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,610
figure out things because I only had

327
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,160
limited access broke into the

328
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,500
ambassador's Secretary's personal gmail

329
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,339
account and then sent an extortion

330
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,560
demand for 35 million dollars now of

331
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,890
course is freaked out the secretary so

332
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,199
she filed a local police report

333
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:57,090
unfortunately we had to ask that local

334
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:03,520
police station to make it disappear

335
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:07,090
which they accommodated for us then it

336
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,250
got even worse now this happens to be a

337
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:11,140
place called the ker house and it's a

338
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,880
national landmark and the Netherlands

339
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,400
this is where all the rich and famous

340
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,500
people would stay at before they headed

341
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,260
out on their luxurious cruise ships

342
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,990
before we had KLM airlines in the

343
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,500
Netherlands

344
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,780
and we were about to host something

345
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,250
called Saudi national day which a lot of

346
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,010
different countries they will have a

347
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,710
national day wherever they might be and

348
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,290
they invite in our case the Dutch royal

349
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,330
family the ambassador to the US the

350
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,089
ambassador to Romania the ambassador to

351
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,720
the UK Japan and so on and so forth so

352
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:48,430
when I say vvv IPS they were definitely

353
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:53,720
vvvvvv VIPs and instead the perpetrator

354
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:57,140
change tactics and said if you don't

355
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,060
give us 50 million dollars we are going

356
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,480
to blow up the ker house and everyone in

357
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,599
it so it was at this point that the

358
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,510
Dutch national terrorism police came

359
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,220
into view and tried to start helping us

360
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,680
out but because of the geopolitical

361
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,750
nature of things that were going on the

362
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:19,189
Ambassador wanted nothing to do with

363
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:21,140
them so privately the embassy section of

364
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:25,040
The Hague went on lockdown

365
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:28,490
we had plain clothes but armed forces

366
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,880
around that entire area bodyguards were

367
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:34,730
hired embassies were very very rattled

368
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:38,290
about this because their ambassadors and

369
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:46,010
their staff were targeted in this case

370
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:49,189
and to make matters worse I was I was

371
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,860
finally able to take a piece of

372
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,540
equipment home with me because I was at

373
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,460
this point so well trusted and I was

374
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,469
doing all the liaison work between the

375
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,300
Ambassador himself and any law

376
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:04,520
enforcement and all the rest of the

377
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:07,639
embassies that I was able to figure out

378
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,800
that the perpetrator had set up a

379
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,510
forwarder on the back end of the email

380
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,010
account and that's how they could see

381
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,920
the traffic going back and forth the

382
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:20,030
email and suddenly the Ambassador

383
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,130
himself said I think I know who it is so

384
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,170
one evening after everyone had left

385
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,120
except for his clothes protection

386
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,310
bodyguards I was left behind with him in

387
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,669
the building and he started getting down

388
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,649
on his hands and knees helping me look

389
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,860
for post-it notes for credentials for

390
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,600
the

391
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,729
suspect because we did not want the

392
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,709
person to know that we were on to him

393
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,820
because that could have made matters

394
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:46,130
much much worse and because of the

395
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:51,020
suspect the suspect had diplomatic

396
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:54,220
immunity so especially in this case law

397
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,740
enforcement did not apply whatsoever I

398
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,960
was able to then get the perpetrator out

399
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,179
of the email account then the

400
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,090
perpetrators started sending emails from

401
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:08,179
other accounts in also repeating the

402
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,949
various threats also listing specific

403
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:12,200
ambassadors names that they were going

404
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:16,429
to kill mentioning the Dutch royal

405
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,410
family and so forth but the perpetrator

406
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,660
screwed up did not mask where he was

407
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:25,130
coming from so I was able to geo locate

408
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,169
us several of the emails to the exact

409
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,700
neighborhood that he lived in in the

410
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,650
hague

411
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,990
so that was between the personal nature

412
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,679
of the attacks the way he acted when I

413
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:39,650
interviewed him on several occasions and

414
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,840
the geolocation information the

415
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:46,880
Ambassador was very very certain it was

416
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,709
this particular individual now in the

417
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,870
mix while we're dealing with all of this

418
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,549
around the corner from both the embassy

419
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,280
and where I live because I lived in the

420
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:56,809
embassy section of The Hague I used to

421
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,149
frequent this lovely pub called

422
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:02,480
Sherlock's pub which is all Sherlock

423
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,980
themed and it's fantastic at one the

424
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,240
best British pub in the Netherlands

425
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,020
award because I didn't even know that

426
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,059
that was a competition right so you know

427
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,970
when when you're stressed or when you'd

428
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:16,010
like a beer I could walk right over it

429
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,230
was a block from my house and one

430
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,150
evening I go in and the owner is there

431
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,720
and it goes uh these three guys have

432
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,919
been waiting for you for two hours now

433
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,240
I'll give this disclaimer in case

434
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,340
there's anybody from the Turkish

435
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,760
government or associated with them

436
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,918
because I met one in at Luxembourg last

437
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,049
week who was not happy with this talk

438
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,040
I'm sorry their intelligence agents were

439
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:43,370
so dumb so they've been sitting there

440
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,399
for almost three hours at a pub sipping

441
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:49,550
tea waiting specifically for me

442
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:53,420
so I walk over and I go hello I've heard

443
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:56,690
that you were waiting for me three

444
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,700
people I had never met in my life so

445
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,710
they give me their cards they happen to

446
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,820
work for the Turkish embassy all three

447
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:08,120
of them our cultural attache and they

448
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:11,450
have been waiting there so that I could

449
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:14,270
give them English lessons and they spoke

450
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:18,190
perfect English right does anyone think

451
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:22,429
that this is suspicious right not at all

452
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:24,380
so for two and a half weeks I dealt with

453
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,929
these individuals gave them English

454
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:30,530
lessons they would wait for me patiently

455
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:33,020
at the pub sipping tea until I could

456
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:36,020
arrive and I of course reported this to

457
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,929
the security services and they verified

458
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,150
indeed yes they were working for the

459
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:43,640
Turkish embassy that they were cultural

460
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:47,540
attache x' that they also had diplomatic

461
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,880
immunity great stuff right and then at

462
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,639
the same time I was also notified that

463
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,370
they found a list and on that list it

464
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,920
was a list from Isis and I was number

465
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:01,939
two out of ten people up for a

466
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:04,040
high-value target so things started

467
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,530
getting even more interesting because it

468
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,080
wasn't just an incident involving the

469
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:11,690
dumb dumber and dumbest Intel agents I

470
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,320
had ever run into in my life but now I

471
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,700
was at real physical risk so I'm not a

472
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,490
person who likes close protection

473
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:23,320
bodyguards so I made agreements for them

474
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:25,130
to just watch me at all times and

475
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,840
towards the end of the two and a half

476
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,270
week time period that I was dealing with

477
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,909
these Turkish intelligence agents one of

478
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:34,220
them gave me an unusual gift I am NOT

479
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,760
Muslim I do wear in Arabic necklace but

480
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,410
I'm not Muslim gave me prayer beads

481
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,870
which of course I promptly handed over

482
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:46,000
to security services to make sure that

483
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:47,899
they didn't have a bug in them right so

484
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,220
after the two and a half week time

485
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:54,500
period they just disappeared and when I

486
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,929
asked security services they verified

487
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,100
that all three of them had left in a bit

488
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:05,310
of a hurry out of the Netherlands

489
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:07,290
never to be seen again right so towards

490
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,840
the end because the incident lasted

491
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,790
almost three months and it was a

492
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,189
stressful three months because most

493
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:17,399
incidents do not last that long I'm

494
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:20,880
lucky I still have hair and we did not

495
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:24,720
pay any extortion we ensured that all

496
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,090
the embassies were safe we did a lot of

497
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,070
talking myself and the Ambassador with

498
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,770
various other countries using diplomatic

499
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:35,939
means to basically apologize for what

500
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:39,000
happened to work with them and also I

501
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,680
made a lot of recommendations for the

502
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,620
Saudi Arabian embassy because the way it

503
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,080
had been set up was very very bad they

504
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:50,310
did not have antivirus they had Windows

505
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,919
Defender right and they had a business

506
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:55,830
network and like many embassies in the

507
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,720
world an intelligence network luckily

508
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,540
they were completely separated because

509
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,760
that would have been even worse right

510
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,639
but they used a home grade router for

511
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,570
example that also had one two three four

512
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,910
five six right there networking rack was

513
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,830
in an area where all you had to do was

514
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,180
if you walked into the embassy you

515
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,889
didn't even have to register the way it

516
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,710
was laid out it was in a dark corner

517
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,500
there were no cameras you could just tap

518
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:28,470
right in or like Jason would pop pop pop

519
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:30,950
right so that had to be changed but the

520
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:34,340
matter with the person who was a suspect

521
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:37,800
now I do not condone extrajudicial

522
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:40,500
punishment however he was from a very

523
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,570
high-ranking family very good family

524
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,150
from Saudi Arabia and the likelihood

525
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,830
that he would have been prosecuted when

526
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,920
he was sent back to Saudi Arabia was

527
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,750
very very very very low so he was

528
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,810
promptly reassigned to a physically

529
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:57,300
dangerous location and shortly after he

530
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:59,879
arrived after his bodyguards got out of

531
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,990
the car he was the only person blown up

532
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,240
in a car bomb

533
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:13,900
so I like to say modern problems require

534
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:17,450
modern solutions so I got some rewards

535
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:19,190
because it was very stressful and one of

536
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,080
the things I got to do was there's very

537
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,360
famous painting in the Netherlands

538
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,980
it's actually listed in an addendum of

539
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,139
the Constitution which states that only

540
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,030
a Dutch citizen can ever own this

541
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,740
painting it's by Rembrandt and it's

542
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,230
called the night watchman and it's

543
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,220
actually bigger than this screen it's

544
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,970
not like the Mona Lisa

545
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,380
tiny tiny right no no no so when the

546
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,840
ambassador was leaving the Netherlands

547
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,940
he had a farewell dinner in front of the

548
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,240
right in the Rijksmuseum in front of

549
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,210
this famous painting and gave me a gift

550
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,770
in an award which I also tested I don't

551
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,770
trust anything from foreign government

552
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:59,750
that's where I roll and I got to enjoy

553
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,220
the evening unfortunately I was sick

554
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,900
that night so I couldn't partake of all

555
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,350
the fancy-schmancy wine so I could just

556
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,429
smell it

557
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:09,830
that's okay and I learned a lot of

558
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:11,990
lessons that sometimes when you're

559
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,689
involved in an incident that might be as

560
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:17,059
simple as somebody leaving a password of

561
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,250
one two three four five six depending on

562
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:22,360
the situation that could be rather low

563
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:26,770
risk or it could get people killed or

564
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:32,449
almost killed so thinking about how

565
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:34,250
certain things can actually cause real

566
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,380
human consequences is very very

567
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,780
important now imagine if you were

568
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,000
dealing with the nuclear event imagine

569
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,340
if you were dealing with the aviation

570
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,580
industry or the space industry or

571
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:51,919
something of that nature I happen there

572
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:54,678
was my fifth nuclear incident I've got

573
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,320
lots of stories like Jason actually

574
00:25:54,679 --> 00:26:00,110
involved a nuclear crane luckily it was

575
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:04,909
not carrying the rod when it collapsed

576
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:07,159
and the vendor had not told the nuclear

577
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:10,440
facility that they had installed a 3g

578
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:13,680
modem in it with a public IP address

579
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,990
yeah cuz that's a great idea so you

580
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,810
never know with these different types of

581
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:22,170
things obviously never trust gifts from

582
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:25,649
a foreign agent or you know anyone kind

583
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,820
of suspicious and also prepare so if

584
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,250
you're ever involved in one of these

585
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,919
types of incidents one of the mistakes

586
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:35,130
that I did that made make was I had a

587
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,620
partner at the time and I thought hey he

588
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:39,570
doesn't need to know about any of this I

589
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,260
don't want to scare him but

590
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:45,030
unfortunately the person closest to you

591
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,770
or the people closest to you can

592
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,870
actually be used against you in these

593
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,690
particular types of incidents well we

594
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:54,090
would call your next or closest hop and

595
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,340
another thing that I learned was try

596
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,830
your best not to panic in these

597
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,250
particular situations and also pause

598
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:04,649
before you speak as much as possible

599
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,270
there there's two benefits to that you

600
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,680
think deeply about what you're going to

601
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,450
say especially when you're dealing with

602
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,670
the minister or you're dealing with an

603
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,010
ambassador of another country another

604
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:18,390
thing is you kind of look smarter when

605
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:21,110
you do that long little pause right so

606
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:25,110
try your best to just take a deep breath

607
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:28,439
and I did leave some time for questions

608
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:31,139
so we should have about 15 minutes to do

609
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,050
questions and I hear that if you ask a

610
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:38,760
question you can get a hat and who

611
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:40,530
doesn't like hats so thank you very much

612
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:50,309
and I'm open for questions

613
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:50,309
[Applause]

614
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,379
Chris that was absolutely fantastic my

615
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,060
mind is blown I have a lot of questions

616
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,150
but first we're gonna take some from the

617
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,070
audience so if you have questions raise

618
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,790
your hand and let's get this party

619
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:10,419
started

620
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:13,360
yes your what are the front okay hi

621
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:17,650
first of all great story just wanted to

622
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,229
ask let's say did eight year old no ten

623
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:23,800
year old I think you after hacking the

624
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,170
DOJ did it ever cross your mind in that

625
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,940
eight year old period from being ten to

626
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,920
being 18 and being able to use a

627
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,380
computer again basically did you ever

628
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:36,270
think you would actually be in charge of

629
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:40,690
handling such a massive event I guess

630
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:43,000
absolutely not I was so happy just to

631
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:45,010
use a computer again because I had made

632
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,450
so many dumb mistakes as a ten year old

633
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:51,520
me that I didn't think that I would be

634
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,380
involved in something like that I knew

635
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,970
at the time both when I was pen and when

636
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,850
I was 18 that I wanted to get into

637
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,140
computer science and I hated the fact

638
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,209
that during that eight year time period

639
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,120
I was not even allowed to use a gaming

640
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,970
console so I could only watch friends

641
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,540
and cousins who would always point it

642
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,430
out because they were little bastards

643
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,790
but I never thought that I wouldn't be

644
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:19,000
involved in something like this and

645
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:22,000
let's say having known that that would

646
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,520
have happened how would that had would

647
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,320
it have swayed you away from doing stuff

648
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,920
like this or would that just empower you

649
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,280
even more I would have been empowered

650
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,810
even more and I would have learned

651
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,520
French a lot better to deal with

652
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,530
diplomats which is one of my challenges

653
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,530
that I'm facing right now I need to

654
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:45,370
speak French more thankful

655
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:47,800
thanks thank you next question somewhere

656
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,570
there in the middle yes we see your

657
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,560
enthusiasm right right in front of you

658
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:55,840
nothing to keep your hands up yes

659
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:58,510
well get to everyone I promise hi I just

660
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,250
loved your presentation I'm not really

661
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,010
sure how you can go through all that and

662
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:06,070
still be so funny and so humorous

663
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,990
so congrats on that but you seem so

664
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,840
confident that I have to ask a question

665
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,690
were you at all at any time afraid for

666
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:17,500
your life and my second question would

667
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:20,350
be if you mentioned at some point that

668
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,840
they might use your partner for was your

669
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:26,320
partner used against you in in some way

670
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,060
and how so because my military

671
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,040
background I have to think that very

672
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,409
much for handling these particular

673
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,629
situations and I was trained for various

674
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:37,480
things like if I was kidnapped and held

675
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,890
hostage and things of that nature and at

676
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,840
one time in my life I actually was

677
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:45,070
kidnapped and held hostage for two and a

678
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:47,949
half week time period so this was a lot

679
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:50,080
simpler in many ways you know because I

680
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:53,590
wasn't you know being you know tied up

681
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,030
and gagged that that that sucked but I

682
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,230
also have the belief that I could be hit

683
00:30:55,030 --> 00:31:00,850
by a bus

684
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:03,310
I could be hit by a car I could you know

685
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,540
not wake up tomorrow because I don't

686
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:09,879
know I might have some undiagnosed

687
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:12,670
medical issue so not not very much now

688
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,010
my partner was not targeted in this

689
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:18,910
particular case but because of this

690
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:21,190
incident on a later case a more recent

691
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,230
case actually he was placed under

692
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:27,000
surveillance by a foreign government but

693
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:30,130
he was prepared at the time whoa Thanks

694
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,780
okay next question here up front the mic

695
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:36,460
is coming to you then we're going to go

696
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:37,389
there in the middle well first of all

697
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,950
thank you very much for your

698
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:43,090
presentation and I'm just doing this for

699
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:44,830
the Hat no just so you mentioned there

700
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,570
are three Turkish intelligence that you

701
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,600
met in the bar and you taught them

702
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:52,600
English and so I'm curious how was the

703
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,370
interaction with them because you had to

704
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,830
actually give lessons right and you had

705
00:31:54,370 --> 00:32:00,129
to do as if you didn't suspect anything

706
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:02,559
or how was that well I didn't have like

707
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,440
a lesson plan but we did conversational

708
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,309
English and they asked me a lot of very

709
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,659
interesting questions about things

710
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:12,610
especially dealing with the Saudi Aramco

711
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:14,350
infrastructure which I danced around

712
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,709
because these were very strange people

713
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:20,590
and they were trying to I think feel me

714
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:22,240
out also to distract me during this time

715
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,539
period which didn't work because you

716
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,330
know I knew everything that was going on

717
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:30,669
but it was just conversations long

718
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:34,210
conversations over tea at a pub which

719
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:37,659
was very strange but kind of

720
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:40,649
entertaining at the end now I can

721
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:43,080
definitely laugh about it thank you

722
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:46,658
we had a question there in the middle

723
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,529
yes please keep your hand raised so we

724
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:49,529
can get the mic to you

725
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:06,989
hello how would be your life without a

726
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,799
computer very boring

727
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:14,269
okay how did you fight with your demons

728
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,940
while not being able to use a computer

729
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:19,289
well I kind of turned it around so at

730
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,320
the time I had to take type writing

731
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:26,820
lessons of all things so I context like

732
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,859
a teenager so that's pretty cool I tried

733
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,389
to do other things but still keeping

734
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:32,099
track of what was going on in the

735
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:36,209
burgeoning computer industry at the time

736
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:40,849
so the day after I turned 18 I bought a

737
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:44,489
computer for myself well okay thanks

738
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:46,289
okay on to the next question the paint

739
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,470
guy he's been like raising his hand the

740
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,470
whole time

741
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:56,369
hey I was very curious about your

742
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,499
digital fingerprinting and how do you I

743
00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:01,738
don't know how much you work on not

744
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:07,590
having so much mr. fingerprinting well

745
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:10,109
over the last seven years I was more

746
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:13,799
permitted and allowed to come out in the

747
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:16,020
world at a previous job so although I

748
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:18,409
don't have an actual Facebook account

749
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:22,049
I've got various fake ones and so forth

750
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:23,819
I I just try to know my surroundings

751
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:26,369
because I know that I am now a bit more

752
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:28,589
of a public person than I was before

753
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:30,540
seven years ago there was only one

754
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:34,770
picture ever of me on the Internet and

755
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:38,460
that was a LinkedIn picture so I just

756
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:41,069
watched myself I don't if I think that I

757
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:44,339
might be in a dangerous situation or I

758
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:48,119
might suspect certain things then I try

759
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:51,359
to divert where it might be and tried to

760
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,339
use precautions including checking out

761
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,149
the hotels that I stay at speaking with

762
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:59,040
their physical security staff as well so

763
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:02,380
I try to keep myself safe in that manner

764
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,430
and I have no I Oh t devices

765
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,109
and a commercial firewall at my house I

766
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:15,618
[Laughter]

767
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:16,509
do have yes yes this is my hobby up to

768
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:20,900
the next one

769
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:24,170
there's a question there so congrats

770
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,670
about the presentation so I'm a nervous

771
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,470
flier and I wanted to ask you about

772
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,869
something I read you uncovered some con

773
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,118
abilities in the bank network so I

774
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:33,589
wanted to ask about that what you can

775
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,239
you tell us about it

776
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,489
yes I can tell you a little bit about it

777
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:39,200
a couple of the things that I found on

778
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:41,359
bone were quite disturbing nowadays

779
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,160
aircraft are flying computers they're

780
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:48,519
driven by software they have autopilot

781
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:53,118
they also sensors and I was able to

782
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:55,819
because of egregious coding errors able

783
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,640
to bypass authentication to get into

784
00:35:55,819 --> 00:36:01,038
both the live and test aviation ID

785
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,288
systems and that system for Boeing is

786
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,450
how you log in and you get flight

787
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:09,470
control software for classified

788
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:12,439
unclassified planes and also satellite

789
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:14,930
systems and that was part of what I

790
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,210
found I also found a way using

791
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:20,660
open-source intelligence to find all of

792
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:25,359
Boeing's fleets in the cockpit cabin

793
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:27,890
view monitoring system as well so

794
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,739
there's a few other things and I'll be

795
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:35,410
getting a lot of pressure from Boeing so

796
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:43,640
I'll be nice and leave it at that yeah

797
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:45,950
ok we have time for questions yes hi

798
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,720
thank you for the presentation and nice

799
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,460
to meet you I'm a journalist and you

800
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,098
mentioned that you are going to work

801
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,960
with reporters without borders on the

802
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:57,200
project to better protect journalists

803
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,079
can you tell us more about that and do

804
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,848
you from your experience have you seen

805
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,769
journalists being targeted do you think

806
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:07,039
it's increasing how do you think

807
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:08,660
journalists should because it's not

808
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,359
about only journalists about their

809
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,680
sources as well and how can journalists

810
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,779
if they don't know how to protect

811
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,009
themselves how can the

812
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:19,900
they're sources to protect themselves

813
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:22,249
thank you sure so the workshop is for

814
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,900
cybersecurity for journalists

815
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:25,939
specifically to discuss protecting

816
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,609
themselves and also their sources not

817
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:30,709
now not every journalist works for the

818
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:33,439
Guardian or the BBC or what have you and

819
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:34,719
gets security awareness training so a

820
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:37,489
lot of journalists especially

821
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,619
independent journalists are not so

822
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:42,079
cybersecurity savvy and when they get

823
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:44,689
documents and data from a source they

824
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,369
can actually get unfortunately targeted

825
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:48,799
and then that source gets found out

826
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:51,279
we've just heard if you've been

827
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:54,829
listening to the United States news that

828
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:58,849
Donald Trump's son outed the CIA analyst

829
00:37:54,829 --> 00:38:00,349
who was the whistleblower which is as

830
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:05,779
far as I'm aware illegal but I'm not a

831
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:09,109
lawyer and it's imperative that we have

832
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:11,299
freedom of the press and I'm a big

833
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:13,009
believer of that so one of the things

834
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:15,469
that I do on the side is I work with

835
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:17,719
journalists and set up various trainings

836
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:21,079
for them to try to keep them safe

837
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:22,759
because I've been a source myself and I

838
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,859
would like to be kept safe in these

839
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:28,759
particular circumstances it's something

840
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:32,390
that I do pro bono so one last question

841
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:33,890
if anyone has them cuz with this I'm

842
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,799
going way back there all the way in the

843
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:43,598
back row wait for the mic keep your

844
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:43,599
hands up we're getting there

845
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:55,190
all those here thank you I enjoyed your

846
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:58,999
your speech oh stop so we can see you

847
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:01,489
okay okay thank you sorry I enjoyed your

848
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:05,450
speech very very much and I actually

849
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:08,900
like those kind of stories which which

850
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:11,450
imply diplomats and such things but my

851
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:13,219
question is do you believe that at the

852
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:17,538
moment of speaking there are other

853
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:21,049
diplomats or vvv IPS that still has such

854
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:23,809
a weak security and how people like you

855
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:27,410
try to prevent issues like the one in

856
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:30,019
your speech to happen again again uh yes

857
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:32,839
quite a few embassies from various

858
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:34,640
countries do have very weak security in

859
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:36,769
many cases the people hired at these

860
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,450
embassies are not a computer expert but

861
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:41,450
somebody who is from a high-ranking

862
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:43,910
family there's nepotism and so forth and

863
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:46,419
favors that are given not every country

864
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,828
does this luckily but some do and

865
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,890
absolutely I was speaking with a

866
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:55,460
minister from Luxembourg the week before

867
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:57,259
last about this particular topic which I

868
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,089
agreed to help on a few things

869
00:39:57,259 --> 00:40:00,619
and this is not the only type of

870
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:02,569
incident that's happened within

871
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:04,219
diplomatic circles there are actually

872
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:06,619
much much worse incidents that have

873
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:09,170
occurred from cyber security issues of

874
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:11,140
food security which have actually cost

875
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,789
lives

876
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,229
thank you so much Chris once again this

877
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,790
was absolutely amazing

878
00:40:15,229 --> 00:40:20,540
thank you thank you

879
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,540
[Applause]
