1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,899
everybody so yeah as I was introduced

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,969
I'm new because when I follow me on

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,150
Twitter it's basically just at my name

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,880
and surname I'm going to be speaking to

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,010
you guys today about securing DevOps and

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
some common misconceptions that people

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:24,000
have around the security surrounding

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,409
that so just a bit about me I've I was

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,720
been a security consultant for nearly

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,000
five years now straight out of

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,000
university studying computer and

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,360
electronic engineering so I am from

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,989
South Africa as well so I really watch

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:45,090
rugby yay but other than that I started

15
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,578
out in the mobile practice within the

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,800
company it was back then it was MWR

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,390
infra security recently I changed every

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,660
day if they could if secure consulting

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,640
now so back then started out as a mobile

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,760
consultant which allowed me to do the

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,859
weird and wonderful things of everything

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,188
else that is not a network and something

23
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,860
that you plug into so there are a lot of

24
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:10,770
stuff got through it on pause devices a

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,750
lot of cool things happened and yeah it

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,339
is just like help me grow help me think

27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,460
about more innovations which eventually

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,280
got me that under the road of DevOps and

29
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,449
how to secure it because as all of us

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,060
know it's a bit of a world waste

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,040
territory out there currently we don't

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,540
really know I would say it's almost on

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,329
the same front as cloud and everything

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,009
like that so yeah let's jump in it so

35
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,889
today I'm going to be speaking to you

36
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,189
guys a bit about just laying some

37
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,630
groundwork about what DevOps is and then

38
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,820
we're going to just quickly jump into

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,210
what the underlying technology is and

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,970
how it can actually be a negative thing

41
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,829
to watch your business but speaking

42
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,509
about a model that we created a stir

43
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,750
running that and then just going into

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,329
our we can solve that problem so I'm

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,270
pretty sure all of you have seen this or

46
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,089
at least a third of hdl-c and and this

47
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,979
wonderful circle year are they in

48
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,299
university or when you start at your job

49
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,389
or if you're trying to secure something

50
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,450
so security surrounding hdl-c is quite a

51
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,890
big thing just securing that code that

52
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:19,250
goes into that

53
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:24,769
process of getting that out to market so

54
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:27,360
there's two parts of a CLC I would say

55
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:31,110
there's a first part which deals a lot

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,870
with the creation of the code so if you

57
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,850
think about it the security requirements

58
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,680
securing the design and securing the

59
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,660
implementation and then obviously the

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,820
maintenance they are it's a lot of hands

61
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,470
on keyboard or drawing on white boards

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,180
or anything like that and it involves

63
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:50,609
the physical code but there's this it's

64
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,560
almost like the the the middle child in

65
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,480
the air that nobody really speaks about

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,730
it's just a sting that we launched over

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,679
here the code needs to be deployed and

68
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,570
that's actually what I want to speak to

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,800
you about today so I've defined this as

70
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,829
well I've said that this is basically

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,709
the DevOps side of the entire hdl-c

72
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,989
process because DevOps does not equal

73
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,270
hdl-c

74
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,340
so if you think about that that would be

75
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,400
very very very much Dave and this is

76
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,840
going to be developed and there's a lot

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,620
of ops involved in the deployment of

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,860
that so yeah did I am speaking to you

79
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,420
guys about DevOps DevOps just quickly it

80
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,360
said that culture about getting things

81
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,220
out to market quickly to market making

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,280
sure that the product is reliable and

83
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,690
just making sure that it's it's good so

84
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,730
it's that integration between the

85
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,280
development team and the operation teams

86
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,500
where they started making take the focus

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,480
of the business so making take the focus

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,980
of the business that everything is going

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,420
digital everything as a digital

90
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,488
footprint and that's what I mean by

91
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,950
making take the focus of the business so

92
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,450
that's that's what I have about DevOps

93
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,929
so let's see what the security

94
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,760
professionals have about DevOps likely

95
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,280
when I did my research about this I it's

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,670
sort of so that everybody had sort of

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,840
the same idea about what it is but then

98
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,709
I started thinking about about it

99
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,149
thinking about what I'm reading here

100
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,760
thinking about what I'm seeing here and

101
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,500
thinking about what's missing so this

102
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,450
may be one of the first misconceptions

103
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,660
that I would like to point out to you

104
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,570
guys so let's look at what stands out

105
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,640
here so we can see stuff like

106
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:36,060
combination culture the set of practices

107
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,520
so what's this underlying theme yer I

108
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,190
would pretty much say that we've got a

109
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,479
very very good definition for the people

110
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,710
and the processes surrounding this but

111
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,180
what about the technology that

112
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,469
underlying technologies are starting

113
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,770
when they need everything driving

114
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,960
everything and that's what I want to

115
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,340
challenge today is that they need to be

116
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,010
a bit of a change in mindset where

117
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,250
everybody is thought that you can't

118
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,800
really DevOps us this magical mystical

119
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,780
being that just gets your code out into

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,450
production that it's nobody really knows

121
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,250
what it is and and we don't really we

122
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,810
don't touch it we just brought it with a

123
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,570
stick and make sure that it produces

124
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:19,580
because once it built the code we don't

125
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:23,580
have to really touch it anymore so I

126
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,979
think this change in mindset came for me

127
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:30,390
as well because that's how I was taught

128
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:33,390
that's what DevOps is and the what it

129
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,909
actually is is it is this complicated

130
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,219
environment that works together that

131
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,420
actually can provide that that from a

132
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,890
security perspective if you can actually

133
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,320
taste you can taste it and you can go

134
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,710
look at it more than just your your

135
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,690
run-of-the-mill network scans so I think

136
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,219
let's take a step back let's look at

137
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,860
where we came from and where we are now

138
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,710
so if you think about in the old days

139
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,740
with security we had the old waterful

140
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,359
models just starting at the top of the

141
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,650
slide and working all the way down till

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,880
we have a product that you can send out

143
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,590
so with security wasn't part of this or

144
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,980
making security part of this it's a big

145
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,270
thing so you go through the slide

146
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,270
security at the end to go defines lots

147
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,250
of bugs now you have to to go on with

148
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,020
analogy climb up the staircase and

149
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,270
eventually get to the top again where

150
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,010
now you could actually try fix the bugs

151
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,630
go through the whole process again and

152
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:28,620
then you see well we didn't really fix

153
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,690
the bugs so what now so that was very

154
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,450
very in the old sense of it that was

155
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,919
very difficult but in the newer sense of

156
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,390
it this is actually a lot more difficult

157
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,820
because if you think about the whole

158
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,169
agile approach that basically that

159
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,250
circle that I showed you in the

160
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,789
beginning

161
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,950
now we go through the scrums of multiple

162
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,280
scrum so we are we finished our scrum we

163
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:52,140
are features releasing and once that

164
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,609
feature releases okay well we quickly

165
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,000
need a pen test before that so we

166
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,160
quickly put a security taste in there

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,680
but by the time Security's taste is done

168
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,580
we're already gone through two more

169
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,500
basically Sprint's that we went through

170
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,599
and once we gone through those Sprint's

171
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,460
now there's a lot more that's out of

172
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,800
context and now we read this report from

173
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,210
the security tasting and like how does

174
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,040
this like what about the race of the

175
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,219
stuff we've now done stuff that actually

176
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,410
like implicates and stuff like that

177
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,150
basically and this of this allows the

178
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,520
stuff that we found in the security test

179
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,159
those features are no longer in we

180
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,200
changed our mind so how do we do the

181
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,750
security unfortunately as to be part of

182
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,080
this ever changing process to actually

183
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,520
make a difference in in that product and

184
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,130
making sure that that product is secure

185
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,359
in the end so so let's look at we spoke

186
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,640
about the people process and thick

187
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,440
involved in devups so let's look at the

188
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,560
people involved in live ups so if we

189
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,200
think about how it was way back when the

190
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,330
people were very disconnected so you at

191
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,659
your dev guys and you had your Ops guys

192
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:03,659
so there was this big disconnect between

193
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,190
the guys and that didn't really solve

194
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,460
the problem so then we started seeing

195
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,200
like hey we need to there needs to be

196
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,580
unity and like we need that corporate

197
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,729
synergy and making sure that everybody

198
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,270
works together and all the lovely

199
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:20,150
motivational posters that we can see so

200
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,969
yeah but so the newer side of DevOps is

201
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:26,280
people are a claw across the spectrum of

202
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,540
what is known as DevOps it's not you're

203
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,390
not a Dave anymore you're not

204
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,610
ops anymore or admin or admin or

205
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,330
whatever you are now within the DevOps

206
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:39,900
team and that means you Dave n you do

207
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,909
ops so one example I can think of is the

208
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,089
guy that's running the the environment

209
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:49,890
yeast writing code so infrastructure as

210
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:51,480
code to basically provide a quicker a

211
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,610
faster turnaround model for this

212
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,290
environment or like to spin up stuff

213
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,080
very quickly

214
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,880
where does that fit in easy Dave because

215
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,890
your rights good or is he ops because

216
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,900
they manages infrastructure so I guess

217
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:08,790
that's a very good example of of this

218
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:10,560
what I mean there so looking at the

219
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,780
processes involved and if you think

220
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,790
about the old way of doing it so now

221
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,230
we're sitting recording we get

222
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,319
everything done

223
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:23,010
build it okay put in my flash drive okay

224
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,640
so walk over to the guy that has to put

225
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:30,330
it in production plug it in okay doesn't

226
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,590
work but it worked on my system so it's

227
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,660
probably your system that's that's a

228
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,480
mistake so I guess we probably all seem

229
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,620
that that in the environment that that's

230
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,400
a very old way of doing it

231
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,710
yes memory stick but I think network

232
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,420
share anything is bein anything where

233
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,810
the code could be all wasted or bolt or

234
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,969
like that artifact could be placed it

235
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,530
was a very big divide between what's

236
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,010
happening here and what's happening over

237
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:58,589
there

238
00:09:53,010 --> 00:10:02,580
so the new way of doing stuff is this

239
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:04,830
big complicated ecosystem of stuff where

240
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,600
you produce code you click a button and

241
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,490
it goes through this pipeline and it

242
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,860
ends up in production or there's

243
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,990
somebody that approves it to go into

244
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,790
production so that's basically a very

245
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,760
complex way of easing our problem

246
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,099
because I already gates today if we try

247
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,170
to reduce something at least twice that

248
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,580
is repetitive we really need to find out

249
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,140
how to automate it for ourselves and I

250
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,900
think that was how we automated it for

251
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,569
ourselves so that's the people in the

252
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,770
process is involved now let's look at

253
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:41,640
the technology I found this on on a

254
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:43,980
cycle take Marshall and man I'm glad I

255
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:48,300
don't have to decide what needs to go

256
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,890
into my system I mean what do you use is

257
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,420
this is even like this is one of the

258
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,060
smaller diagrams that I saw of all the

259
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,439
takes oh I feel for the other devs I

260
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,010
feel for the guys that have to manage

261
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,210
this like it's hard it's really it must

262
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,400
be very difficult to choose what

263
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:06,720
actually should be in your in your

264
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:09,209
environment but I guess that's also

265
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,319
where I started seeing that

266
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:13,089
something more need to happen here

267
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:15,819
something more needs to be defined

268
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,139
because this is really like a very very

269
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:20,259
well to waste scenario that we're

270
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:22,329
sitting here with anybody think and

271
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:24,069
choose what they want and and and pick

272
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:26,378
and choose of a list and say like but I

273
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:28,118
think this solves my problem but in the

274
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:33,759
end that actually creates more loopholes

275
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:36,429
and what's actually in place so they

276
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,769
still made main things to I think the

277
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:44,470
digital industry in digital industry

278
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:48,249
today so there's is mainly the code that

279
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:51,100
gets produced and the users that use the

280
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:53,259
system so the code that gets reduced is

281
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,119
your product and your users or your user

282
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,679
base that that's your bread and butter

283
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,730
that that's the people that provide you

284
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:59,649
with the money so that you can produce

285
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,059
more goods so that you can get more

286
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,009
users so that you can produce more good

287
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:05,170
and that vicious cycle that were in

288
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:09,730
there but that's all another story for

289
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:12,069
another philosophical day so what can

290
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,929
you do to this we need to protect this

291
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:18,399
system we need to protect those two main

292
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:20,649
things so firstly on the one side we can

293
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,220
straight model the code we can provide

294
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:26,379
our devs of training making sure that

295
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,649
the code that they produce as a grade

296
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:32,529
top-notch no bugs perfect vulnerability

297
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:35,379
report comes in clean like we've got the

298
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:38,470
best Dave's in the house in the world

299
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:40,779
and they produce a scheme code and on

300
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,800
the other side on the production systems

301
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:47,980
we can paint testers so we can normal

302
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,339
stock standard paint tests or basically

303
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:56,459
security testing of whatever ends up on

304
00:12:51,339 --> 00:13:01,600
your production systems so I think the

305
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:04,388
the big question is what about this

306
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,759
model bot so I mean we can go through

307
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:10,420
traditional tasting of like saying okay

308
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:12,639
well yes that this is our environment

309
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,559
this is our list of IPs give it to

310
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,350
somebody okay scan it in map okay

311
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,230
nothing's found on it by the way we use

312
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,059
Jenkins heard about Jenkins

313
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,660
let's weekly you run some lightweight

314
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:27,040
update

315
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:30,550
Cinci okay well that's fine but yeah it

316
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,819
doesn't really provide us with much much

317
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:38,250
insight other than just on a very very

318
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:40,930
very baseline level this is secure so

319
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:44,439
what we started doing is we we figured

320
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,660
out that with our research we we saw

321
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:48,849
that we couldn't just think of this as a

322
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,709
set of IPs in a list or in an Excel

323
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,629
spreadsheet somewhere we sorted we

324
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:55,000
needed to think of it from a bit more of

325
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:56,920
a holistic perspective and the more

326
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,459
research we did and the more we engaged

327
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,219
with our clients we could see that we

328
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:06,339
needed to start modeling this so we

329
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,290
started looking at building a model for

330
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:12,790
this and we this is by no means complete

331
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,639
this is evolving with every taste that

332
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,939
every new environment that we find this

333
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:21,910
is we add to this or we changed as we we

334
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:22,719
are in the process of just figuring out

335
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:27,600
what this is

336
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,740
so this is that model and basically from

337
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,740
what you could see from all that take

338
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,380
available this is a very big elephant

339
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,759
that we needed to eat and we need to

340
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,319
figure out how we could basically

341
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:45,670
approach this so another misconception

342
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:49,719
that arise during the research that I

343
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:51,969
did is that if you look at if you look

344
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,220
at this environment I think the first

345
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,399
instinct that you would say is this is

346
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:02,050
the dev environment so I guess from a

347
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:04,509
Productivity perspective this is we you

348
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:07,240
get the code to the server that gets

349
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:11,980
built if if this goes down that doesn't

350
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:16,149
affect that it could fix this so as soon

351
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:18,160
as as soon as I started thinking about

352
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,899
this a bit more I realized that from a

353
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,079
security perspective we can't really

354
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,579
think about this like that this

355
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:26,229
environment is actually part of the

356
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,819
production environment because from a

357
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,870
psychic security perspective if this

358
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:31,300
gets compromised

359
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,790
it's a production application that gets

360
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,500
compromised in the end it's not nothing

361
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,560
is going to happen with the devs there

362
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,390
is still going to be able to produce

363
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,040
good but it's your production

364
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,110
application your users that are going to

365
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,760
be basically vulnerable now because of

366
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,180
this environment that get got

367
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,720
compromised and unfortunately with

368
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,630
DevOps if something goes wrong it's a

369
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,040
case of all roads lead to production

370
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,660
compromised unfortunately because I mean

371
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,430
like what would it mean if your

372
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:06,199
application is an internet banking site

373
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:07,609
or if it's highly highly valuable like

374
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,670
SCADA system or something like that that

375
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,560
you're developing what would happen then

376
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,050
with your whole user base people would

377
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,050
start losing money or if your SCADA

378
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,849
system is used in say like electricity

379
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,069
production facility or something like

380
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,839
that that can cause a lot of damage or

381
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:27,950
anything like that and that is what a

382
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,390
production system is and this is what

383
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:35,230
happens when there's production

384
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:35,230
compromised you switch your lights off

385
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,990
[Music]

386
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,640
first phony and actually the incident

387
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,500
response guys but usually there's a lot

388
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,530
of reputational damage that goes with

389
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,530
that

390
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,199
so all those not lost let's walk through

391
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:55,010
a couple of scenarios that I accounted

392
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,510
with with my journeys through people

393
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,819
with some of the clients that we have

394
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,420
and some of our internal systems that we

395
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,240
have let's start figuring out how we can

396
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:08,449
use those model actually to provide us

397
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,150
some insight into a methodology on

398
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:13,910
testing this environment that we set

399
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,550
here so attack scenario one we've got a

400
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:19,610
goal of extracting the secrets from the

401
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:22,010
secret management system so it's

402
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:26,089
basically what the secret management

403
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:28,400
system does is it just it creates this

404
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,899
barrier between your developers and your

405
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,140
production secrets and production

406
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:37,610
secrets by this is something like SSH

407
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:40,310
keys or two servers or DB credentials or

408
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,600
anything like that so that's basically

409
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,129
what your secrets are and they they

410
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,919
actually very valuable and you don't

411
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,420
really want your devs to have them they

412
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,460
they actually only need to be owned by

413
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,360
the people but they only need to be

414
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,950
known by a very

415
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:56,389
few select individuals that are highly

416
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:59,150
trusted within the company so this also

417
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:01,100
provides as a bit of a safeguard of

418
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,870
Dave's not hard coding credentials

419
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,449
within the source code which is also

420
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:08,870
another thing so let's walk a bit

421
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:11,570
through through the scenario so firstly

422
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:15,320
they use the git lab as their source

423
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,149
code repository they had public

424
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,639
repositories on there and they allowed

425
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:23,179
users to sign up and register their own

426
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,100
users and its own don't think it's bad

427
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:26,750
you want your devs to be able to you

428
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,309
don't want anybody you don't want to you

429
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,260
have the additional overhead of somebody

430
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,270
creating them accounts and somebody

431
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,070
managing that and yeah so like your dev

432
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,010
signed up they create their own accounts

433
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,960
everything it's fine on its own not a

434
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:43,160
problem

435
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:46,490
so as you're bold agent use that lovely

436
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,860
to call Jenkins and it allows you

437
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,600
basically to what what it just does is

438
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,639
it allows you to orchestrate your

439
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,379
building process and through a bunch of

440
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,540
bold scripts you can tell Jenkins what

441
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,340
to do with your code and it basically

442
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,740
takes the building away from the from

443
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,750
the devs they can just press a button it

444
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:06,260
gets uploaded Jenkins and Jenkins bolts

445
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,760
that so basically was Jenkins what you

446
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,010
want to do is you want to restrict the

447
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,240
access to people do those bold scripts

448
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:16,250
that that the people actually have

449
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,080
because it's a it's quite a valuable

450
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,309
piece of information that you have there

451
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,059
and if you can control that you can

452
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:22,070
actually control the building

453
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,020
environment so if you can control the

454
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,149
building environment what if this is a

455
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,820
shade building environment and you're

456
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,320
working on market waste site by the

457
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,389
other people are working on internet

458
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,080
banking so now in the shared building

459
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,020
environment

460
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,110
you now have basically you have access

461
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:42,740
to the internet banking site full

462
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:44,899
full-on access to that just because it's

463
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,410
that shared building environment so on

464
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:53,380
again on its own some of the stuff that

465
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,380
I mentioned not really that big deal but

466
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,189
yeah Jenkins sorry I just forgot to

467
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,080
mention something Jenkins was also

468
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,610
configured in the specific scenario to

469
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,230
there is something called build on merge

470
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,860
so as soon as you perform a merge

471
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,559
request

472
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,299
fires of a web book to get lab which

473
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,809
then pulls in code and bolts code for

474
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,320
that merge so you would think not a big

475
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,799
deal

476
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,080
what can somebody do with that so let's

477
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:21,230
actually look at that attack parse a bit

478
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:25,909
more in depth so anybody can register on

479
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:27,200
gate lab so that would mean that if an

480
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,570
attacker could get access to the network

481
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,520
they would be able to register their own

482
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,649
user and they could start reading your

483
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,500
source code but what that would also

484
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:41,360
mean as they would be able to start

485
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,600
performing merge requests on code that

486
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,459
you have so with the Jenkins having that

487
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,230
lovely bold script being such setting

488
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,020
you're in gate lab that allows us to

489
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,940
basically look at now having access to

490
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,889
that full script we perform a merge

491
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,620
request Jenkins bolts on that merge

492
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,230
request and you upload your virtual to

493
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:06,320
the build server and that basically

494
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:07,760
gives you access to anything that that

495
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,290
happens post that and that would

496
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,970
actually give you access as that gets

497
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,980
pulled into the system the secrets get

498
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,840
pulled into the system during the build

499
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,780
process you now have access to the

500
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,120
secrets post both build actually and

501
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:26,928
from that build agent perspective so

502
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:30,049
that basically allowed us to just start

503
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:32,510
looking at this from a bit more of a

504
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:34,160
holistic perspective if we take a step

505
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,690
back we can now start basically forming

506
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,600
out there's a lot of stuff that actually

507
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:44,809
when they work together that causes a

508
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:46,070
lot of problems so that was the first

509
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,600
attack scenario so let's look at another

510
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,780
detection or something that I found it

511
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,299
at one of the clients the goal this year

512
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,149
is to get code running in production so

513
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,179
I guess that would be a big goal for a

514
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,130
lot of a lot of attackers so let's

515
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,720
quickly walk into that so they were

516
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:08,540
using that session stack so that means

517
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,010
it's but bucket bamboo Jireh all that so

518
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,800
yeah they use bit bucket as the code

519
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,900
repo once again allowed anonymous read

520
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,180
and they allowed anybody to sign up a

521
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,460
case that's a big problem

522
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,440
a lot of people have is managing the

523
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:25,810
user base so it's something that I see

524
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:29,390
quite a lot so they allow signup and

525
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:34,220
obviously they use bamboo so bamboo is a

526
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:35,930
CI infrastructure that they use so what

527
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,910
this company had is they had some old

528
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,340
servers lying around

529
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,420
so they said the one team that I worked

530
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,939
with that was a mobile application

531
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,200
development team so obviously mobile

532
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,490
apps would cry a bit of a different

533
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,080
building environment and the normal app

534
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,210
so it couldn't be it couldn't happen

535
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,370
within the shade building space because

536
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:55,040
if donating the the dependencies every

537
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,169
time would just be too costly so they

538
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,050
set up their own local build agent that

539
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:02,270
connected to bamboo in the beginning it

540
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:05,000
was fine but after a while I noticed

541
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,360
that these guys are not managing this

542
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,440
anymore

543
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:13,639
so basically running app update upgrade

544
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,020
took too much and it caused too many

545
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,630
troubles for them that so that they just

546
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:21,680
left it there anything that sitting

547
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:24,230
there next to them and yeah that was

548
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,700
quite a bit of a big problem because now

549
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,890
you've got outdated software running in

550
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,210
this on this bold server and as we saw

551
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:33,070
on the previous example the both server

552
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:37,010
is actually quite important to this so

553
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:38,570
it's an unmanaged it's unmanaged so it's

554
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,040
just a box sitting there and anybody can

555
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,750
walk up plug in a flash drive and they

556
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,030
have access to this box so now they have

557
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,520
access to the bold agent as well and

558
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,800
what we found was that there was no MFA

559
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,800
on that deployment so that crucial step

560
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,100
after it's built office in the artifact

561
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,740
repository once somebody has to click ok

562
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,230
we can put it into production there was

563
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,610
no additional authentication required

564
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,230
for that as somebody could just click a

565
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,750
button and it went straight into

566
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,930
production and I guess it's very easy to

567
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:11,630
see the attack pass here because I mean

568
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:14,060
you just register a user again oh you

569
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,590
could walk up to the bold agent and you

570
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:19,370
could plug in and you could get access

571
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:21,860
to that because I mean physical access

572
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,199
and physical security is not up to

573
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,669
standard in a lot of places and that is

574
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,040
a big problem and if somebody really

575
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,990
wants to value wants to target this they

576
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,010
can get in and they can they can attack

577
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:36,830
it via that

578
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:38,390
so again taking a step back we start

579
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,580
looking at it and we now we start seeing

580
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:45,110
a there's like stuff that we can define

581
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:46,760
here about what's going on so like these

582
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,590
are new stuff that we see these aren't

583
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,450
your traditional vulnerabilities that

584
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,970
you see but these are stuff that happens

585
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,100
across multiple organizations and we can

586
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:58,700
use this definition to now see and say

587
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:02,120
like hey these vulnerabilities that we

588
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,160
found we can now start looking for that

589
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,649
and and work that into our methodology

590
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,429
that we found because if you think about

591
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,910
it

592
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:12,740
on the one side we've got the top 10 and

593
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,900
developers can use that and they say

594
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,360
it's web web devs and there's other

595
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,679
platforms as well that provides some

596
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,870
insight into what's happening in

597
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,880
security so they say it's a web

598
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,379
application they can use the OS protein

599
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,960
to measure themselves against what's

600
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,640
happening here and on the other side the

601
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,290
guys are managing of a network you can

602
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,030
use something like this and stop trainee

603
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,710
to say like hey these are the things

604
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,200
that we need to watch out for these are

605
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,390
the things that's that's available but

606
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,700
in this modal sick there is not really

607
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,380
anything and there's nothing that people

608
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,150
that have to define this network that

609
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,690
they can use as referenced you actually

610
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,470
figure out what is this that we have to

611
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,480
be worried about

612
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,280
because once we define this

613
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,320
infrastructure even if we do it as as

614
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,790
code what do we what are the base

615
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,159
practices what are the stuff that we

616
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,870
have to look out for and I'm not

617
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,880
proposing that there should be a top ten

618
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:06,168
but I think if we work together as a

619
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,730
community we can start defining what the

620
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:09,559
top ten should be in this environment

621
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,210
because this environment there's a very

622
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:17,899
important environment in in the

623
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:20,059
ecosystems of today's digital space so

624
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,299
now we walk away and we say okay well

625
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:25,280
that's all good and fine my daven but my

626
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:28,940
DevOps environment is isolated there's

627
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:32,870
stuff that that it's put in protection

628
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:35,120
it's not internet exposed it's closely

629
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:39,110
monitored everything is fine

630
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,239
so then you say okay cool let's look at

631
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,219
the threats that surround this so

632
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,809
externally into this environment that's

633
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,399
external attacks I'm true

634
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:48,289
everybody's familiar with that just

635
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:49,758
attacking the application or the server

636
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:54,669
when you think trying to get into this

637
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:57,409
from an external perspective nothing new

638
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:59,870
so now the attack is in trying to attack

639
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:02,779
this why ad or something like that they

640
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:04,268
they successfully fished in nowaday they

641
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:09,110
want to attack this via Active Directory

642
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:14,029
again very well defined attacks it's not

643
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:16,610
really really new application so like I

644
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:18,619
said let's quickly do a quick scan of

645
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,229
this environment let's quickly take a

646
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:22,580
look and look at an application each one

647
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,320
of these are probably going to be looked

648
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:27,439
at individually you're not going to look

649
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,980
at it holistically so everything is fine

650
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,440
we configured everything properly

651
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:37,549
everything is a clean bill of health so

652
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:39,289
now we've got all this attack vectors

653
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:41,749
that we've said okay well they don't

654
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:48,200
really mean anything because we're

655
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:50,570
secure but I beg to differ in that sense

656
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,220
as one of the easiest way to get in

657
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,559
these days is actually why I did that

658
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,529
the devs that are sitting and coding in

659
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,129
in the environment so what if you have

660
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:03,169
to actually ask yourself you can't be

661
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:06,709
saying that nothing if it will go wrong

662
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:10,309
so I think what if something does go

663
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:15,169
wrong I think it's a very big word in

664
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:16,309
the industry BYOD sorry I just wonder

665
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:18,259
like I don't know if I have to do

666
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:20,149
something with before I say that it's

667
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:24,499
very it's a very sensitive topic that's

668
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:27,080
currently in then in the basically in in

669
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:29,450
the industry that we're saying is they

670
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,749
all BYOD policies and bring your own

671
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,909
device and from a deaf perspective

672
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:37,009
that's great you can bring your own

673
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:41,269
device it's oftentimes a lot stronger

674
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:42,769
than then what and then what the company

675
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:45,230
can provide you which means you can be

676
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:46,970
more efficient so when when but

677
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,379
unfortunately that also increases the

678
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,840
attack surface because if you think

679
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:52,549
about it at the end of the day you're

680
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,918
closing that laptop and when you're

681
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:57,289
taking it home with you and it of it and

682
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,759
it usually doesn't have the same machine

683
00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:04,039
auditing controls as a race of

684
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:06,999
the company and you it's it's I feel for

685
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:09,559
both sides here I feel for devs because

686
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:12,080
you really don't to be stifled and you

687
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:14,418
don't don't wanna be controlled in that

688
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,908
sense where you have to work on this

689
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:21,409
very and powerful machine and you have

690
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:22,789
to not produce code and there's a lot of

691
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:23,779
demands there's a lot of pressure and

692
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:26,539
and I know

693
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,739
BYOD makes sense if the company doesn't

694
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:29,359
have to pay for that thing from a

695
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:31,159
business perspective from a business

696
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,049
perspective your devs are producing more

697
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:38,570
code and they're producing it faster

698
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:40,668
which is great so like I said attack

699
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,320
surface is bigger and I think this is up

700
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:44,480
to the devs as well

701
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,428
if a company provides you free EDR

702
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,830
software that's not because they want to

703
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:50,059
spy on you and if they are spying in you

704
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,710
I think you should find another place to

705
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:55,549
work because that's not how companies

706
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:57,080
should actually do that so that's mainly

707
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:59,059
for their protection just remember that

708
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,489
you are working in that company as well

709
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:04,220
and just be mindful of what you are

710
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:07,820
doing as a developer on your machines at

711
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:09,980
night because you you probably just

712
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,330
gonna whatever after watching a movie

713
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,279
that night on the laptop or something

714
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,570
like that or playing a game the next day

715
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,090
you're gonna go you're gonna open it up

716
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:19,189
you know plug into the network and

717
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,869
you're going to carry on coding on let's

718
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,429
say you work on internet banking site or

719
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:25,039
something like that that means that's

720
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:27,230
quite a big quite a high valuable target

721
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,269
and you you really you starting to paint

722
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,249
a very big target on yourself

723
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:32,809
as a div if you start doing that and if

724
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:33,279
you're not careful about how you're

725
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:35,749
doing that

726
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,850
so if you compromised the devs machine

727
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:39,289
you probably compromising more than just

728
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:41,509
that because now you have an entry point

729
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:43,759
into this entire network and you can

730
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:46,009
actually initiate processes yourself now

731
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,169
and and you don't even have to bypass

732
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:52,489
processes you can just initiate the

733
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:56,659
normal processes well yeah I don't think

734
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:58,759
all is lost the key thing that I want to

735
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:01,519
take better when I just point out is

736
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:04,129
that you need to build resiliency into

737
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,889
those systems and with resiliency I mean

738
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:10,279
that you need to anticipate the attacks

739
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:11,840
and dissipate that an attack is probably

740
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,750
going to happen if it hasn't happened or

741
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,330
it

742
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,640
and with that anticipation make sure

743
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:20,040
that it doesn't only require a single

744
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,740
dev machine to knock over your entire

745
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,629
business or knock over the entire

746
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,930
process that you've worked so hard and

747
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:30,240
spent a lot of money to put into place

748
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:33,180
because normally if they do that it's

749
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,070
not going to trigger EDR if it's not

750
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,950
going to trigger any malicious things

751
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,960
because if an attacker attacks a develop

752
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,310
system through a Davis machine it's

753
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,650
going to look like normal or another

754
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:47,490
mole day and you probably never got even

755
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:49,920
going to know where it came from so in I

756
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:54,240
know in the financial sector there's in

757
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,920
order thing there's a big thing I called

758
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,140
the the four-eyes principle you can even

759
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:02,340
go through the six eyes principle where

760
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:05,490
you need to have four eyes at least I'm

761
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,399
touching that piece of code that goes

762
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,710
through so that would say that the guy

763
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,020
that approves the code going into the

764
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,730
build process shouldn't be the same guy

765
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,710
that approves it at the end going into

766
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:22,350
production so that that should be a

767
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:25,980
separation between that that that

768
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:27,449
functions within the system so those are

769
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,340
two examples that I use there's a lot of

770
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,110
other places where that to about the

771
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,240
four or six eye principles could also

772
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:39,419
apply on this pipeline and and should

773
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:41,610
actually be in place so yeah if I can

774
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:45,750
give you some key takeaways to just take

775
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:48,300
away from today there's three things

776
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,790
that I really feel that that good course

777
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:54,120
that are common misconceptions and that

778
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:54,659
could cause problems within the

779
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,540
environment

780
00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:02,610
it's overcoming the mindset that they

781
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:04,830
saw DevOps as just an ideology I know

782
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:06,389
like everybody's saying that it's not

783
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,310
something that the chemi taught or

784
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,530
anything that that can be actually

785
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:12,389
implemented a lot of people are saying

786
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,600
that it's your dev and your Ops guys

787
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:17,810
sitting around a campfire roasting

788
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,889
marshmallows and singing together and

789
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,720
there's just a lot of stuff that that

790
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:25,140
people say that that they try to take

791
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,920
the tangibility of it away and just say

792
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,890
that hey this is

793
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,440
this culture know that it is a set of

794
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:33,720
systems it is a set of systems in your

795
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,920
business it's a set of systems in your

796
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,490
business that you probably don't have

797
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,750
oversight over because of the enormous

798
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,990
pressures that are put about getting

799
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:47,280
that product to market so yeah also

800
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:49,200
understand that assessing the system is

801
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,240
also possible assessing it from a bit

802
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,550
more of a holistic perspective it's the

803
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,290
way that it should happen you shouldn't

804
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:57,030
just be looking at the systems in

805
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,260
isolation you should be looking at how

806
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,080
they interact with each other because

807
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,940
the biggest thing that makes devops work

808
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,840
is that its processes working together

809
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,429
to get something through so understand

810
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,799
those processes understand the

811
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:14,580
technology and under not underneath that

812
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:18,290
and make sure that you actually can say

813
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,580
I know we need gitlab I know we need

814
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,679
Jenkins this is why we need it and

815
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,969
substantiate why these products are

816
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,310
being used in your in your environments

817
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:32,959
and then lastly is building resilient

818
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:35,460
systems that can understand attack where

819
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,070
you can't really be too cocky these days

820
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,740
and say that I'll never be attacked I'm

821
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,419
invulnerable I mean that's we all know

822
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:45,239
what happened with the Titanic it's the

823
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:48,540
tank in the end so bold resilient

824
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,699
systems make sure that the systems don't

825
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,830
have single point of failures anyway

826
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:56,100
through that entire process make sure

827
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:59,100
that through that they they're resilient

828
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:01,950
to attack and even if one or two systems

829
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,810
fail or gets compromised that it won't

830
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:06,830
compromise the entire process and get

831
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:10,770
something in the end there in production

832
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:12,190
and yeah that's from my side any

833
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:16,190
question

834
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:17,670
[Applause]

835
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:24,240
thank you

836
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:26,460
are there any questions in your opinion

837
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,770
do you think if we were to separate or

838
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,910
remove automation from one of the other

839
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:34,770
either coding or the ops I come from an

840
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,870
OPS background I hate the idea of using

841
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,890
some Jenkins and give it to developers

842
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:41,210
they don't know what's going to happen

843
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:46,410
is that a safer alternative or is that

844
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:47,730
unavoidable in the near future so just

845
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,850
to understand correctly you say the

846
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:53,760
separation of responsibilities no just

847
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,230
automation so yeah automation of both

848
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,930
use one or the other

849
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:00,000
yeah yeah so automation plays a big part

850
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,669
on it but the automation also needs

851
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,040
happened securely that it can't just be

852
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,980
and click a button and it goes all the

853
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,600
way through you so there needs to be

854
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,240
that that principle of four is that I

855
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,589
explained that there needs to be so yes

856
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,000
I think we clicked can go through all

857
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,140
the processes can go through all the

858
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,410
security checks and everything like that

859
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,569
and at the end before rather use I think

860
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,600
it's a continuous delivery model not a

861
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,850
continuous deployment model where it's a

862
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,670
it has needs that approval before it

863
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,980
goes out so they've they've or testing

864
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,690
environments sure push that directly and

865
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,210
they can click a button it bolts in but

866
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:40,160
for the I variables environments such as

867
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:43,950
production they need to be some form of

868
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,890
just process or something a control in

869
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:50,160
place that would separate that but

870
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,600
automation is it needs to you but a lot

871
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,520
of the problems happen is where there's

872
00:36:51,600 --> 00:37:00,210
no automation it's people manually doing

873
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:03,600
stuff over there great representation

874
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:06,540
thank you and I was looking at one slide

875
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,580
where you had threat modeling mentioned

876
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:11,340
and looking also the complexity of the

877
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:14,840
middle layer of all the many tools that

878
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:17,670
we have in development groups nowadays a

879
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,920
solution be to require as part of the

880
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,320
threat model to have a dedicated section

881
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,250
where we do a threat modeling for the

882
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,640
development environment itself yeah

883
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:30,260
so that is definitely needed so all the

884
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,670
tax and lawyers and everything that I

885
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:37,369
found is where we did dedicate it we

886
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:39,770
it's almost a mix of threat modeling and

887
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:41,390
the tech Faust mapping in a very deep

888
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:43,579
dive in this environment and just

889
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,560
figuring out what are all the risks of

890
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:47,750
these things if they work together and

891
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,220
we started mapping out the attack parts

892
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,720
and through that we could start defining

893
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,740
some of the common vulnerabilities that

894
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,509
we found between systems in between

895
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:59,118
people that we did those also definitely

896
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:02,869
a threat model of that model system is

897
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:07,329
definitely needed and I would say that

898
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:09,890
even if it's already implemented yet

899
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:11,450
I'm even thinking this could become like

900
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,098
a ghost project to have a standard

901
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,109
library because many there are many

902
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:17,240
systems but they're pretty common could

903
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:19,130
be like a project to have a public

904
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:24,828
library with standard threat models for

905
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:30,200
such tools yeah it's kind of related

906
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:32,869
with an LDAP with they appropriate to

907
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,750
implement in this pipeline LDAP

908
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:42,859
authentication with single sign-on and

909
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:49,700
MFA technology with single sign-on and

910
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:52,848
even with its suitable it's yeah it's

911
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:55,160
free to go you can use that a lot of the

912
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:56,869
tools these days have they should they

913
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,310
should otherwise they are they not very

914
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:01,280
useful they should have held up

915
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:02,980
integration in there okay let's take

916
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,240
another question

917
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:12,980
hey I'm really great I really it's cool

918
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:16,759
to see the DevOps department and take a

919
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:21,200
security really real in consideration

920
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,900
and build all this this model I'm

921
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,078
wondering in your model where do you put

922
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,180
code analysis from the security

923
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:33,109
perspective like static code analysis or

924
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:37,140
dynamics called analysis and if you have

925
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:40,270
that in your pipeline yeah so

926
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,400
the pipeline is about generics it fell

927
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:45,790
underneath the tasting space there so if

928
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,070
you look at that tasting came into the

929
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:50,920
the continuous integration side of that

930
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:54,250
and I'm static and dynamic code analysis

931
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,010
very important in that however you need

932
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:58,630
to know what you're looking for though

933
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,400
that needs to be properly set up and

934
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,260
properly configured because if you're

935
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,540
just testing for the default

936
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,550
configurations of that static analysis

937
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,620
or the dynamic analysis you're probably

938
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:10,600
not going to find the actual problems

939
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:13,120
and it I know it's a very big

940
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:16,089
retroactive thing again where devs find

941
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,220
the problems and then they actually add

942
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:21,580
that to the test cases finder problems

943
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:23,200
add that to the test cases where as it

944
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,210
really needs in that thread model that

945
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,069
occurs we need you think about the

946
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:29,290
threads think about what could possibly

947
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:31,630
occur because if you think say you're

948
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:34,390
hosting a web application you need to

949
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,220
think about the wasp octane and how to

950
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:39,270
incorporate that into the static or

951
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,709
dynamic code analysis part of that and

952
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,480
make sure that you protect against

953
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:47,290
injection attacks make sure that you

954
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,510
protect against basically paltry

955
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,920
bursaries directory access anything like

956
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,420
that make sure you have these cases in

957
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,790
there that specifically look for that

958
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,930
so yes it's definitely part of that it's

959
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,130
definitely part of the model and it's

960
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:01,230
definitely poor or something that should

961
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:05,740
be in there thank you any more questions

962
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:08,380
can we take someone that's idea hi

963
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:10,089
really nice presentation I really

964
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,940
enjoyed it and especially the point

965
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,670
about DevOps is more than just an

966
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:18,190
ideology because people try to reduce it

967
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,080
a bit to devups is just a mindset the

968
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,920
tools are not that important but you put

969
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,790
a really good point on that now to my

970
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,220
question

971
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:31,029
traditionally security and at least in

972
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:32,890
my organization is a separate department

973
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,470
a separate team and analyze the

974
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:39,100
gatekeepers of security before you go to

975
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:42,939
production but recently I've even heard

976
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:45,009
the term of dev sick ops and somewhat

977
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,030
like you say any presentation in the

978
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:50,400
middle something needs to happen

979
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,210
we're supposed to kind of learn a bit of

980
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,880
everything

981
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:56,640
so they've operation security and kind

982
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,450
of become some generalized like the

983
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,839
current trend with unified engineering

984
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:09,299
you should still be someone standalone

985
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:12,420
and specialized both ways so from the

986
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,790
security perspective you definitely need

987
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,840
to know what's happening in your

988
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:18,060
developers environment and you need to

989
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:22,290
know what's happening why are they doing

990
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:29,009
what they're doing because that's a big

991
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:30,840
part of why we do what we do you need to

992
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:32,880
know why are they doing why are they

993
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,340
cutting corners like this why why is

994
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,840
this happening and if you can figure out

995
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,940
that then you can figure out the root

996
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,740
cause of what's going on so you need to

997
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,609
understand what the devs are doing in it

998
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,029
and from a security perspective

999
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:46,500
perspective you need to understand what

1000
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,790
they are building is specifically on

1001
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,670
that project that they're on and what

1002
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:54,540
other is could involve for that so from

1003
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:58,020
a dev side of it they've I believe also

1004
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:01,430
need to be taught the way that they

1005
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:05,759
almost need to go through an offensive

1006
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:07,618
training I would say we're almost more

1007
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,570
like a proactive training where they

1008
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:11,490
actually get taught how does an

1009
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:14,430
injection attack look and what does it

1010
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:16,410
do how does directly travel so happen

1011
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,509
what is it to you what is the effect of

1012
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:22,368
it let them actually go through that and

1013
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:25,140
figure out teach them what what this is

1014
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:26,490
and then when they produce it they'll

1015
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,830
make sure that it doesn't happen again

1016
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:31,709
so from a dev side of it

1017
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:33,569
I think teach them educate them educate

1018
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,820
them on the security side of this and

1019
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,380
from a security perspective you really

1020
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,640
need to understand what's happening you

1021
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,010
need to understand what's happening with

1022
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,460
the devs and why are they doing what

1023
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:46,830
they're doing so in the end we're gonna

1024
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,910
still have this separation we cannot

1025
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:52,619
know everything as one person I believe

1026
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:55,950
there is something specifically in dev

1027
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:59,640
environments called they they need to be

1028
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:01,109
security where and it's called security

1029
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,779
champions and then the dev environment

1030
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:04,480
way

1031
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,500
it's somebody that's very a lot more

1032
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,090
skilled to the rest of the day of

1033
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,000
insecurity and I guess that's some way

1034
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:11,170
where it becomes a bit more of a

1035
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,180
combination of the two where this guy

1036
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,650
has skills from both sides and you can

1037
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,750
use that and when they're doing their

1038
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,490
stand-ups they ease the guys I can point

1039
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,290
out and say hey but maybe think about

1040
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,580
this rather why don't you do it this way

1041
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:25,540
because that's going to introduce a

1042
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:27,790
vulnerability so no definitely they

1043
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,130
should be that unification but it's not

1044
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,750
all the Dames that need to go through

1045
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:34,840
that it's not all that all security guys

1046
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:38,800
it's like we we need to yeah find that

1047
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:40,060
middle point thanks a lot all right one

1048
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:47,020
more question because we're running

1049
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:51,930
really short on time oh hi do you know

1050
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:55,280
any real men in the middle attacks that

1051
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:56,549
successfully pushed code into production

1052
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:04,960
[Music]

1053
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:06,310
between the so I'm not sure about man in

1054
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,120
the middle of text but I do know there

1055
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:11,710
are a couple of cases where by attacking

1056
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,509
the the David environment that's how

1057
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:16,240
people could access so if you think

1058
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:18,850
about something like I think it was

1059
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,189
recently that happened camScanner and it

1060
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:23,410
said that it's a big applications go

1061
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:25,200
google it application that you can scan

1062
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,490
documents and stuff like that with

1063
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,049
people just started noticing it's a

1064
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,910
mobile application so if they just

1065
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,950
started noticing that all of a sudden

1066
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:35,170
their application is starting to serve

1067
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:37,689
malware as being flagged as by antivirus

1068
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,980
and they didn't do this and when they

1069
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,510
actually did the investigation they

1070
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,000
figured out that somebody was actually

1071
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,710
deploying code were like altering they

1072
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,540
build artifacts without them knowing and

1073
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:50,170
that was going through the process first

1074
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,670
post scans post dynamic and static

1075
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,380
analysis that's why that's why I

1076
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:55,180
mentioned that the build agent is so so

1077
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,560
important because there's certain points

1078
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:01,029
in that way you can actually alter the

1079
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:04,900
artifacts without triggering anything so

1080
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:06,880
yeah thank you thank you very much

1081
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,950
everyone and thank you Neal for your

1082
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,900
presentation

1083
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:11,899
