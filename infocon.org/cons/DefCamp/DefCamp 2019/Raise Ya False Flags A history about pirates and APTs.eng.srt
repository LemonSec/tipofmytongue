1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,170
we're talking about false flags we're

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,970
talking about this information there's a

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,670
bit of history there's a bit of humor

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,070
and there should be a lot of support for

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,900
from us especially because our next

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,929

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,779

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,379
be interesting for you basically today

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,480
we're going to talk about false flags

19
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:56,070
what's the history of false facts and

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,879
where are we now where are we standing

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,820
right now but in order to understand the

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,920
current the current the present we need

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,060
to look back in the past and we need to

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:13,020
see what happened what people before us

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,330
did and of course it starts from the

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,030
phrase false flags and the faith the

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,240
phrase false flags was actually defined

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,090
as as you can see in you all oxford

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,360
english dictionary but it was defined in

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,790
in the 16th century only in the 16th

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,920
century this phrase was actually put

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,060
into the dictionary which is pretty

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,490
interesting you know you know because

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,820
you say oh it's like 16th century we all

35
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,548
don't know and then you actually find

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,658
you can find out that the term flag

37
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:50,040
itself was defined no more than 30 39

38
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:53,579
years earlier so in this if you lived in

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,180
the 15th century 14th century there was

40
00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,059
no term coined as false flag but you

41
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:04,380
know where do pirates come into all of

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,740
this well you know the answer is they

43
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,190
don't

44
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:12,090
and you shouldn't be disappointed

45
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,190
because the great period of piracy which

46
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,440
was the you know 17th century

47
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,829
has a lot of to a lot of things to talk

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,130
to like to him teach us and of course we

49
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,430
cannot forget about the greatest pirate

50
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:30,150
of all mr. Blackbeard and I don't know

51
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,580
if he was like smoking head smoking

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,470
years but he was a well-known pretty

53
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:39,660
well-known guy so 300 years later we

54
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,900
actually can find that in the in the

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,359
Oxford English Dictionary there's a

56
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,420
different term and the different term

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,720
says or the different definition and the

58
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,530
definition says of false flags is a flag

59
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,440
used by a ship to miss miss in

60
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,990
misrepresent his nationality okay so

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,420
we're getting there it's interesting

62
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:07,290
because if you dig deeper in like in

63
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:10,829
1940 14 you see that it was allowed for

64
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:13,140
a ship to run a false flag up until

65
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,050
before the attack so you would be like

66
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,899
hey I'm a friend you know getting closer

67
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,850
getting closer I'm your friend oh

68
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,010
change the flag now I'm gonna attack you

69
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,230
and the the others were like okay what

70
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,060
the heck happened and it was totally

71
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,739
normal it was totally perfectly okay so

72
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:34,230
you know fine but you know what happened

73
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,380
before like of course people should have

74
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,929
done this like before and they did if

75
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,500
remember the Great Fire of Rome which

76
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,709
happened in year 64 you know there was a

77
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,590
great fire a lot of people died then

78
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,070
people started saying that the actual

79
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,320
Emperor back then the narrow Emperor he

80
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,750
actually set the fire himself and he

81
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,670
wanted to torch the city which is kind

82
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,130
of nonsense you know like why would you

83
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,030
want to torch her own City let's go with

84
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:08,489
that so what did Niro do he said Oh

85
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,980
fine let's let's blame the Christians

86
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:14,640
and not only did he blame the Christians

87
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,560
but he also threw them to like lions and

88
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,769
like he threw them like you know in a

89
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:24,150
big what remained of a Coliseum because

90
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:26,039
it burnt down and basically they they

91
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,130
got like he kind of killed a lot of

92
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,760
Christians

93
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:34,000
and making them forcing them to take the

94
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,830
blame of the fire so that was like okay

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,050
interesting but let's let's go a little

96
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,500
bit closer to our times and then like

97
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:44,770
let's go into 1939 with a play operation

98
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,270
Himmler so these three fine gentlemen

99
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,630
here on the right so this guy in the

100
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,190
middle

101
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,219
I controls his name I have to like try

102
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,080
to download like his Heinrich Himmler

103
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,360
Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Mueller

104
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,680
so Heinrich Himmler is the guy in the

105
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:03,300
middle here and he said okay we need to

106
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:11,380
do something in order to have to be like

107
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:14,680
kind of to be allowed to start our

108
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,990
aggressions like military aggressions

109
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,060
and we need them we didn't kind of on a

110
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,070
scapegoat or we needed like to have a

111
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:26,020
reason to do that and basically they

112
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:30,849
said okay in 1939 on the 20 on the 29th

113
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:33,070
of August so two days or one day before

114
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,880
like some days before they actually

115
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:40,120
invaded Poland some people some of my

116
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,450
officers from military not even like

117
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,840
Nazi Nazi officers they went into this

118
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,700
like crustacean here and it was a

119
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,830
broadcasting station and it was like

120
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,750
glide leads it was glide with

121
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,310
broadcasting station and the incident is

122
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,130
called gravity incident and basically

123
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,330
they went addressed as polish officers

124
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,940
they went there and started broadcasting

125
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,250
messages of hate against Nazi Germany

126
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,010
and not only did they do that but they

127
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,100
also started some or other actions in

128
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:12,340
order to have a reason for the Germany

129
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,540
to invade Poland and literally they did

130
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:19,090
they know like some days later actually

131
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,010
Nazi Germany invites Poland and invades

132
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,530
Poland sorry and then they start the

133
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:26,020
Second World War so historians say that

134
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:29,320
the operation Himmler was the first act

135
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,060
of war the arch the first act that

136
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,250
actually started the Second World War

137
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,830
of course there was a lot of build up

138
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,890
before them so it's a it wasn't only

139
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,659
this one you know what about the

140
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,990
Americans the Americans said

141
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,360
in 19 1962 in Cuba there was a

142
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,270
revolution or around around that time

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Fidel Castro and Che Guevara they took

144
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,760
control over the country they ruled out

145
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,950
the puppet the American puppet that was

146
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,740
installed by the Americans and they

147
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,750
started building their their society and

148
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,660
when they built their society they

149
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,300
decided to go with some people might say

150
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,400
the wrong option like implementing

151
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,070
communism so the Americans of course

152
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,489
they got they got worried and there is

153
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,290
this guy who said ok let's do something

154
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,450
about it and how should we do it well

155
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,420
let's let you do a covert operation like

156
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:25,630
a false flag so this guy here general

157
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,450
Lehman lying it sir go on the left and

158
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,909
he said that ok let's do something

159
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:35,440
interesting let's blow up US ships and

160
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:40,020
let's do terror terror attacks on US

161
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,450
soil pretending to be Cuban agents

162
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,919
luckily the president back then Kennedy

163
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:49,870
said no he put a stop to all of this and

164
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:53,170
this was a plan for in the effort from

165
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:56,290
the joint chief of staff from Department

166
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,970
of Defense so I don't know what would

167
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,040
have happened if they actually would

168
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,650
have invaded Cuba or did something like

169
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,320
a retaliation attack because you know

170
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:08,890
like Cuban Missile Crisis like some

171
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,440
years later it didn't go quite well so

172
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:13,450
enough of history you know like there's

173
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,310
a lot of examples here back and then and

174
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,110
then like you can find find out even

175
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,860
more those are like a little tiny bit of

176
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:22,570
examples for the ones for those of you

177
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,150
who don't know me I'm a security

178
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,969
researcher working in Kaspersky's great

179
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:30,940
this slide is the favorite slide of one

180
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,950
of my friends she always like complains

181
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,049
about it you know like but I only always

182
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,510
stick it here too so she can see it

183
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,609
every time every time I present you

184
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,309
might know me from from the threat

185
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,380
intelligence work I do in within Mike my

186
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:46,630
team which is a global research and

187
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,070
analysis team and I'm doing threat

188
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,410
threat intelligence and threat research

189
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,210
so some of my tools are open source like

190
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,829
Clara and also I doing some honey pots

191
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:59,710
projects

192
00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:04,390
so who attended last year Def Jam who

193
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:06,430
attended my talk oh thank you very much

194
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,710
thank you very much if you remember from

195
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:11,500
last year I said during my

196
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:14,350
disinformation misinformation talk I

197
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:19,570
said that the information were the one

198
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:22,510
that we have like we defined has three

199
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,840
parts cyber cyber espionage cyber

200
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,970
sabotage and must subpoena manipulation

201
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,470
last year I talked about this one this

202
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,140
year I'm going to talk about this one

203
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,100
and of course the cyber parts experience

204
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,660
sabotage they also do use Marvel so

205
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,910
let's see like what is this smaller

206
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,560
about like what are we doing here so of

207
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,900
course you know when you when you

208
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,030
analyze malware you see some artifacts

209
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,949
there are some artifacts in the binary

210
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,560
when you when you're doing static

211
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,690
analysis for example and those artifacts

212
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,589
they might give you some interesting

213
00:09:52,690 --> 00:10:00,010
ideas of what the actual malware does or

214
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:02,770
not so for example we have debug pads in

215
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,960
in hm like there's a possibility

216
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,150
whenever you compile your binary from

217
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,250
like gets translated from them like

218
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,380
high-level programming code into binary

219
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,870
machine when you compile your binary

220
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,610
it's it inserts the path where you

221
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,130
Europe where your project was located

222
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,020
and this is like a well-known feature

223
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,700
kind of in order for you to be able to

224
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,460
debug your programs a little bit later

225
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:26,950
by you by somebody else but then when

226
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,900
you develop malware or other types of

227
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,140
programs you might actually have this

228
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:35,790
debug paths and of course we see here

229
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:40,300
really from HR developing BIOS code

230
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:42,550
which that's okay you know that this is

231
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,890
basically this ism from a piece of code

232
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,479
from from a bias from a ThinkPad laptop

233
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,670
you can find it it's it's on virustotal

234
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,430
just sample it's like totally legit you

235
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,949
know I think it's it's pretty okay but

236
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,219
there's all there's a one downside come

237
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,300
on

238
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:01,510
if you gonna use versioning system

239
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,529
don't use SVN like what year is this

240
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,689
like seriously at least they're using

241
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,579
using something what about compilation

242
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:11,129
time stamps well they're all so

243
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:14,040
meaningful you know because you might

244
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:16,560
see whenever a model was created and if

245
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,990
the attackers are not careful enough to

246
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,790
remove the compilation time stamps then

247
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,339
you might actually have a glimpse of

248
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,170
their campaign you might see when did

249
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,459
they compile the first of course after a

250
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,290
cluster all the malware

251
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,939
where did they compile the first time

252
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,699
when was the first time they compiled

253
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:36,540
that model family when did they try to

254
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:41,008
when did they try to like stop what were

255
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:43,680
the the period of times months days when

256
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:47,639
was there working times basically there

257
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:52,079
are campaigns which we managed to infer

258
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:55,949
that they had a time zone of like for

259
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,138
example plus GMT plus 80 GMT plus nines

260
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:00,258
because they were compiling all those

261
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:03,600
samples in that time frame

262
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:06,870
we have other model families or like apt

263
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,100
campaigns where they work for during 1st

264
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:15,290
of January or 31st of December and if

265
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:20,339
you correlate this with some let's say

266
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:23,610
traits from like culture or some people

267
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,529
you might say that some some countries

268
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,629
they do not celebrate New Year on the

269
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,670
1st of January some countries they do

270
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:31,740
not celebrate Christmas on the 21st of

271
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,750
December so you might infer some

272
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,269
knowledge about that stuff anybody

273
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,139
recognizes the specific compilation

274
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:43,410
times on 24th of March doesn't in 15

275
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:45,000
well from my point of view I think it's

276
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,649
pretty interesting because it's the

277
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,050
compilation time stamp of a campaign

278
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,600
that we we announced this year operation

279
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:56,309
shadow hammer and it was a campaign that

280
00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:00,779
infected the the US was the a sous-vide

281
00:12:56,309 --> 00:13:02,129
company and they they managed to get

282
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,740
into the network and they managed to

283
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:08,339
deploy a supply chain attack and how did

284
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,519
he do it well they took the point they

285
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:13,679
took a binary which was legitimately

286
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,269
created by us the implanted the malware

287
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,889
and then they pushed it on their

288
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:18,150
production server so they compromised

289
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,790
their build in

290
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:22,740
they build servers but the sample that I

291
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,079
pushed on the production server which

292
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,450
was signed by my Asus it had this

293
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,220
compilation time stamp here and it's

294
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,510
interesting because the original model

295
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,100
the original sample had the same

296
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,920
population timestamp so the question is

297
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,870
were they in the network in 2015

298
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,520
did they change it because it's trivial

299
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,230
to change the compilation time stamp who

300
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,540
knows of course

301
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,910
strings are easy to detect like this ISM

302
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,189
this is a Cloud Atlas sample they have

303
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,550
like after they were some encrypted text

304
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,290
or I would say obfuscated and basically

305
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,240
offer after the office kitchen you can

306
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,760
clearly see the samples the C&C server

307
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,640
and like some commands are doing here so

308
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,200
those things are in the sample now it's

309
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,970
get a little bit interesting because you

310
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,210
might say ok let's use code written

311
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:10,320
let's say if an attacker uses the same

312
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:12,150
code so an attacker might say oh I have

313
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,100
this debug function or I have this

314
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:17,220
module of common like communication

315
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,670
module and they have like a lot of

316
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,130
samples they don't want did it's like

317
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,130
fizzy fizzy fizzy it's not feasible to

318
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,840
write rewrite your own communication

319
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,689
module all the time so what do you do

320
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,760
you actually take the same pieces of

321
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,290
code and then you add it in other in

322
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,689
other projects so basically you have

323
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,180
like multiple samples which we use the

324
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,610
same code if you have kept the

325
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,219
capabilities of actually detecting what

326
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,620
other samples are if the other samples

327
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,810
are using reusing some parts of the code

328
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,880
you can correlate and you can enforce

329
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,060
some information about it but what about

330
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,360
reuse of zero days zero day zero point

331
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,969
one one day exploits whatever you name

332
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,640
them well it's the same and it's

333
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,840
actually interesting because nowadays

334
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,490
with a lot of zero day brokers you see

335
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,420
zero day vulnerability being exploited

336
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:17,910
by either multiple apt actors or like in

337
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:20,880
different parts of like sectors and this

338
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,069
like you know you might say art artery

339
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,480
the same actor or do they have like the

340
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,270
same day but the same is a different

341
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,130
ability or like who's leaking those

342
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,439
vulnerabilities or like what's happening

343
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:35,070
you might have a correlation or you

344
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:39,030
not have a correlation okay so this is

345
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:41,610
like a short introduction of how how do

346
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,350
we do research with Marvel I'm pretty

347
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,050
sure you might know about it so I'm

348
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,850
confident it was okay let's see like

349
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:52,410
what happened like how do we put these

350
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:54,780
things in practice of course a very

351
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,819
important paper that I also took

352
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:59,130
inspiration from when I'm gonna like

353
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,900
present you some of the cases is this

354
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,510
one like deception tactics and modding

355
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,699
attribution it was written and presented

356
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:09,540
as Virus Bulletin by two good friends of

357
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,970
mine one and Brian Bartolomeo and those

358
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,490
two good friends of mine usually they

359
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,230
look like this when they work and when

360
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,480
they presented they had like a history

361
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,480
of from false Flags attacks that

362
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,250
happened up to 2016 so what I'm doing

363
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,740
now like I'm gonna present some of the

364
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,900
parts that they dimension and I'm also

365
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,360
gonna add some new stuff that happened

366
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,640
after their publication based on our

367
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,670
research from Kaspersky so Cloud Atlas

368
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,170
doesn't in 1400 Atlas everything here is

369
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,329
public you can research you can find

370
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,479
information and of course when it's not

371
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:45,210
public I'm gonna mention Cloud Atlas was

372
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,090
like a nepeta actor trying to you know

373
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:51,870
like targeting diplomatic entities and

374
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,340
the idea was that when we found out we

375
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,150
also knew about Red October which

376
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,910
happened in 2012 and when we saw some of

377
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:02,819
the phishing phishing emails some of the

378
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,040
the spear phishing websites but what

379
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,670
about mostly phishing emails when we saw

380
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,459
them do this they had a very very very

381
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:14,280
very good resemblance of what Reducto

382
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,650
body and they were they were basically

383
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,170
using the same methods the same types of

384
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,850
phishing emails as Red October and that

385
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:24,720
was like pretty weird you know like what

386
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:27,300
heck then we dug deeper and we found out

387
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,700
that they are actually they were

388
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,879
communicating with South Korea and we

389
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,770
were like seriously is this like a

390
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,170
connector from South Korea like South

391
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:40,020
Korean speaking actor it turns out they

392
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,670
actually infected routers in people's

393
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,820
houses and they were using those routers

394
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,240
to proxy connections so basically they

395
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,100
were like

396
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,290
mimicking to be located in South Korea

397
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,870
that was pretty cool also there are some

398
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:54,480
strings in Arabic in hindi also God Save

399
00:17:51,870 --> 00:18:00,149
the Queen and John Clark strings that

400
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:03,450
they put in malware to like appear to

401
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:07,230
speak English I guess or to be like a

402
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:11,400
pure British I don't okay what neutron

403
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:14,070
2013 what neutron had like again like

404
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,150
it's an apt campaign but it had two

405
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,909
interesting strings

406
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,850
it had the string la riviere which is

407
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:24,330
like weird from my point of view because

408
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:26,730
it's it's Romanian clearly I also had

409
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,340
like the Russian string with - no which

410
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,920
means like completely like how it is

411
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:35,159
correct like any Russians you know

412
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,320
successful successful thank so it had

413
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,700
had those strings and you might say okay

414
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,439
okay so those guys who are who are using

415
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,470
one neutron that the Romanian no like

416
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,970
the world in order also in order to

417
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:54,000
trick researchers they set up a lot of

418
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:57,030
MLM schemes they tried to like they had

419
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,130
like ten companies like front companies

420
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,080
the front websites they were doing a lot

421
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,360
of stuff they had like a bitcoin

422
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,480
scamming scheme going on they were

423
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,959
pretty you know they wanted to like him

424
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,980
hide in the water you know Tiger milk

425
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:16,950
Tiger milk was not some well-known apt

426
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:20,480
campaign also targeting governmental

427
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:24,750
entities but what's interesting is that

428
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,370
they signed their malware using the

429
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,400
stock stand certificate

430
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,959
so we found a malware with this with a

431
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,550
signed with the same real tech

432
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,640
certificate that Stuxnet was it was

433
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:39,600
signed but there are some questions like

434
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,370
first of all why would you sign why

435
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,469
would you sign something with a

436
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:47,040
certificate that was stolen five years

437
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:49,530
ago and then the second question is how

438
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,720
the hell do you get your hands on the

439
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,690
certificate which was revoked of course

440
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:58,650
but how do you get your hands like

441
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:59,070
anybody knows like anybody so okay

442
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,799
there's

443
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:06,899
no Tiger milk developers in this crowd

444
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:09,000
that's pretty cool um a newer newer

445
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:11,639
false-flag campaign which is kind of

446
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,710
mild I wouldn't call it a false flag but

447
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:17,279
I just wanted to mention it you know

448
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:20,130
some banks in in late Latin America and

449
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,320
also in other parts of the world they

450
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,330
got this message and basically they were

451
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,418
saying we are fancy but we have chosen

452
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,799
the bank name to target our next DDoS

453
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,880
attack they were actually doing DDoS

454
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,399
attacks they were doing like a

455
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,659
discothèque DDoS attack for 0.5 gobbets

456
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:38,489
for 30 minutes and then when then they

457
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:40,110
were like giving the bank one day and

458
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,690
then they would start a DDoS attack with

459
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,580
one gigabit 10 gigabits and so on so the

460
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,200
DDoS attacks were real kind of but they

461
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,639
said okay we'll friends if their search

462
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,460
for fancy bed and you'll see our

463
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:51,750
capabilities it wasn't like I don't

464
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,320
think it was like that and then of

465
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:57,480
course banks we told like we told we

466
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,950
told like whoever asked us don't pay

467
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,029
don't pay them because they might come

468
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:06,600
back one year later you know and then we

469
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:09,570
get to do Q do Q 2.0 you might have

470
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,059
heard about Dookie o-duca 2.0 Stuxnet

471
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,639
flame the entire family the till the

472
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,649
till that family so basically they if

473
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:18,029
you don't know about them go read the

474
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:20,699
map there's like a lot of information

475
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:26,250
about this campaign was was highly

476
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:28,259
actively 2015 and it's at least for me

477
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,809
it's very interesting because it was

478
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:33,059
used to infect Kaspersky so they

479
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:35,519
infected our company and they stayed in

480
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:38,460
our network what's interesting about

481
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,019
that one is that they had they had two

482
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,789
strings which were like pretty

483
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:44,070
interesting they had like the Romanian

484
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:44,960
anti hacker string and they had ugly

485
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,879
gorilla

486
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:57,990
anybody knows what ugly gorilla refers

487
00:21:47,879 --> 00:22:02,070
to close but not so the Romanian entire

488
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:04,529
anti hacker was was basically a way of

489
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:07,678
doing reverse reverse

490
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:09,360
RDP connections of course we don't like

491
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,649
in our network you there was no

492
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,629
possibility from the internet to

493
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:14,820
actually access the servers from

494
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,910
because of firewalls so what did they do

495
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:21,389
they actually used proxies and whenever

496
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:23,970
the infected machine would beam to the -

497
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:26,610
like outside CNC command our CNC server

498
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,130
it would send a packet and in the packet

499
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,060
it if the packet had this Romanian anti

500
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,920
hacker string big basically it

501
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:38,129
recognized as a magic magic packet and

502
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,020
then that connection was used to proxy

503
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,030
from the outside to get into the network

504
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,680
and then from the network they would be

505
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,680
able to connect to other machines

506
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,270
through our own RDP so this is public

507
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,460
you can see like you can see like how

508
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:53,639
they did it it's pretty interesting

509
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,580
cause like back then in 2015 we were

510
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:02,280
only there were only two Romanian people

511
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:03,810
doing research and it was actually even

512
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,110
before I got hired

513
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:09,960
but then the ugly gorilla is something

514
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:14,040
interesting the ugly gorilla is done

515
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:17,760
basically a guy from the apt one the

516
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:23,310
comment crew guy yes his name is Wang

517
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:30,300
dong his nickname is and hear me out

518
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:33,510
Jack Wang but anyway his um he is

519
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:36,840
basically one of the five PLA officers

520
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:38,520
that are actually indicted by FBI and

521
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,939
I'm pretty sure that he's actually

522
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:46,230
developing malware right now in China I

523
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:49,500
don't think he has like any will to exit

524
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,210
China but yeah basically we found a

525
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,400
string in there we we found the nickname

526
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,650
and was like okay fine so this model is

527
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,240
is made by Chinese people like no you

528
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:02,700
just can put you just put a string in

529
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:05,190
there now the second part of my talk is

530
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,450
gonna be about what's happening like

531
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:12,210
what can we do like in the New Age and

532
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:14,820
as I mentioned those are the things that

533
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,650
were mentioned by Brian in one stock now

534
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,189
those are some interesting things that

535
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:22,260
are basically I want to talk about and

536
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:26,020
the first thing I wanna talk about is a

537
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:30,450
body run a leak so in 2019

538
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,450
in May this year there was a website

539
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,520
hidden hidden reality website and this

540
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,380
website was was published and basically

541
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,560
they said they claimed they had

542
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:45,580
information about Rana Institute which

543
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:49,030
was when entity in Iran which was part

544
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:52,120
of doing hacking and trying to doing

545
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:54,280
like cyber operations and they had the

546
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:59,040
website and they were like leaking stuff

547
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:02,710
about agents about malware about

548
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:05,950
operations there was a guy or a twitter

549
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,630
handler they were doing on twitter they

550
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,220
were doing they were basically

551
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,350
disseminating information on twitter

552
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,120
disseminate information on telegram on

553
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,010
the web site on the web site you could

554
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,290
search for information it was kind of a

555
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,510
WikiLeaks style it was like pretty well

556
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,760
made and then like the question is like

557
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,760
who is behind this leak like what

558
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,590
happens and why would you do it and some

559
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,180
of the information is very thick like

560
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:31,540
some of the information maybe it's not

561
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:36,660
you don't know based on our research we

562
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,659
believe that with like good good good

563
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:45,430
confident with like good measurement

564
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:47,409
that they are connected to the they are

565
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:49,060
connected with the surfaces they we

566
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,970
suspect that they might be connected

567
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:54,070
with the surface again and this is based

568
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,720
on some domains they used and they

569
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,120
forgot I did a mistake and they forgot

570
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,240
to do something so basically it's in our

571
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:05,110
private report we talk about more about

572
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,120
why we suspect this connection then it's

573
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:10,179
dark then we have like dark hotel which

574
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,199
happened last month or we wrote about

575
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,630
the report last month the dark hotel

576
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,930
campaign which was pretty well known but

577
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:22,780
it resurfaced with a new wave of wave of

578
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,940
attacks basically spearfishing but it

579
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,379
was a highly profile spearfishing and

580
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,860
then like they had like a multi-stage

581
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,600
infection and they also had like on rat

582
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,919
Marvin in it you know basically after

583
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,990
the infection order to control the

584
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,480
victims computer so this was pretty cool

585
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,730
but then what we found out it is not

586
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,280
much but we did find some in

587
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:45,460
ding stuff so basically we found like a

588
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:48,250
North Korean user agent so basically

589
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,020
whenever they were using their Marvel

590
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:54,040
was connecting to the CNC computer like

591
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,570
servers some they use the KP the KP

592
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,899
country code and then basically you

593
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:00,669
might say like they copied pasted it and

594
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,340
they forgot to change it or something

595
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:07,780
and also they use the crown naman chrony

596
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:10,060
macro anima font which is used mostly by

597
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,399
North Korean so people in North Korea

598
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,840
yeah I haven't seen anybody or like any

599
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,640
malware or like anything

600
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,550
no no more so anybody using the cranium

601
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,880
affront of outside from North Korea so

602
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:25,240
you might say is this like North Korean

603
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,850
marker well the more like question is

604
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,220
most probably not you know but they just

605
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,709
implemented these false Flags in order

606
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,600
to try to lure attack like researchers

607
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:39,460
to think to like do the wrong

608
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:42,760
attribution and last but not the least

609
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:45,040
the most important one from my point of

610
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,980
view happen in February Olympic

611
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,460
destroyer so again this is public

612
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:59,080
information like this oops this is not

613
00:27:51,460 --> 00:28:02,370
something that I uh well I think my

614
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,490
computer is turning shutting down okay

615
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:11,540
nice

616
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:13,580
so exactly infecting my computer no no

617
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:18,409
it's gonna pour off it's gonna power off

618
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:22,010
there's no way to like yeah okay so only

619
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:23,930
pick destroyer do you have a laptop Alex

620
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:26,030
maybe you can plug it in and then like

621
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:28,550
you can continue but meanwhile only pick

622
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:31,820
destroyer basically it was used for um

623
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:34,010
it was used for um infecting the

624
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,870
Olympics so that happened in in South

625
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:38,360
Korea and then like they were trying to

626
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,979
blame of course people were saying North

627
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,770
Korea is gonna like do something they're

628
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,810
gonna like try to ruin the games and

629
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:47,780
everything and then you know first day

630
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:50,720
of the Olympic Games hit the fan

631
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:53,300
like people couldn't print their tickets

632
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,160
like it was a chaos in the network and

633
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,250
like all like most of all a lot of

634
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,390
computers were like knocked down and the

635
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,340
right ball like they would a good

636
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:04,460
couldn't be usable anymore and it was

637
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,970
like super super bad the Marvel was a

638
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,280
worm

639
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:10,670
it was exploiting on other computers and

640
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:14,090
basically the idea was that they were

641
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:16,340
trying to they had people ask who did

642
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:18,830
this and there were like some

643
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,629
interesting interesting resemblance so

644
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,939
they first of all they had there was a

645
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:26,300
resemblance of the encryption encryption

646
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,670
key which was identical to a blue node

647
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:32,600
of sample that was like so basically

648
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:35,450
Lazarus a subdivision of there was a key

649
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:39,679
which was identical code so basically

650
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:41,900
code reuse then upon everybody said some

651
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,410
people said oh my god this is it like we

652
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:47,540
found the we found the link it's

653
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:50,540
definitely these guys and then we

654
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,649
analyzed the P format the rich headers

655
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:56,570
and in those in the rich headers when we

656
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:59,210
noticed that the rich headers were

657
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:02,149
identical with another sample that we

658
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,940
found out earlier so basically what

659
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,040
another Bruner example so basically what

660
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,680
the attackers did they copied the rich

661
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,050
sample from another the Rich Beem

662
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,630
metadata from another sample they added

663
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:18,649
into their own model

664
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:21,380
furthermore we noticed that they were in

665
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,240
distances from what they did and

666
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,280
actually what they were trying to show

667
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,280
so there was a concerning consistency

668
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,680
and this is what Wow nice we have it

669
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,649
back thank you so we should said we

670
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:37,900
should looking for looking further up if

671
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:41,330
I can change my clicker please also it's

672
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:44,090
perfect perfect so it's in the rich

673
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,010
header and basically those headers were

674
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,870
identical but they shouldn't be

675
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,240
identical unless compiled on the same

676
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:52,550
computer so this was from the only pic

677
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,070
this story this from was from another

678
00:30:52,550 --> 00:31:00,310
mother

679
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:02,810
then we actually we post basically we

680
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:05,060
posted this one in March and we said

681
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,740
okay there's a problem with the rich

682
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:10,010
header and this is what we did and then

683
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:12,440
later in in the summer we actually

684
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:15,350
attributed the attack on the Olympic

685
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:19,060
destroyer to Hanes which it's one of the

686
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:21,409
russian-speaking deputies so you know

687
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,639
what's gonna happen like what what what

688
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:28,240
would you believe the problem is with

689
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:32,810
attribution is that it's very tricky and

690
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:35,330
we live in a time where it's very easy

691
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:37,190
to attribute like to do geopolitical

692
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:41,260
attribution and to try to change

693
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:45,580
people's opinion from my point of view

694
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:48,950
there are three rules of death of the

695
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:52,790
attribution Club the first rule is don't

696
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:56,840
do attribution like don't do it like

697
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:59,030
research or malware analyze it see what

698
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,000
it does it's you get more meaningful

699
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:06,020
information there's like who did it like

700
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,660
who was it you found a murderer like fix

701
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,520
your problem if you have to do it if you

702
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,230
do I have to do attribution be very

703
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,750
careful what you attribute though

704
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,540
because it's like he can here have false

705
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:21,290
flags you can have mistakes you can have

706
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:23,960
an agenda yet you might want to push and

707
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:28,990
the problem is if you do it in a wrong

708
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:31,520
way you might actually have my god

709
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,300
consequences and some of the quests does

710
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,900
consequence

711
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:38,050
can actually be deadly and the reason

712
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:45,340
I'm saying this one is because of

713
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:47,710
something that happened in summer you

714
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,990
click Next

715
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:53,330
thank you so you might remember this

716
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:55,340
tweet from from the Israel Defense

717
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:58,699
Forces and basically they managed to

718
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,860
find out like I'm basically a place

719
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,210
where the some Hamas were doing some

720
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:07,219
cyber cyber attacks and they Mandela

721
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,970
they nuke the place I'm actually

722
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,740
impressed

723
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:13,190
they didn't nuke this building as well

724
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:16,580
so they were like I'm actually more

725
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:19,490
impressed they tweeted about it but they

726
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:23,240
said ok we found those guys they were

727
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:25,130
doing some hacking against Israel

728
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,100
we know for sure they did it like let's

729
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:30,470
nuke them what if they didn't I'm not

730
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,719
I'm not contesting this to it I'm pretty

731
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:35,210
sure they have the reasons and but let's

732
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,220
think um you know like hypothetical way

733
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,830
you know like what if somebody hacks

734
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,410
another like 4th party collection which

735
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,990
is a topic again one and my manager

736
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,970
question Ryan talked about it like what

737
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,250
if somebody hacks an attacker and then

738
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,110
they start deploying attacks from there

739
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,470
like the the victims

740
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,820
so the third attacker that basically

741
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,500
somebody hacks on attacker who hacks

742
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,360
somebody and then basically they launch

743
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,100
the attacks on behalf of the first

744
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:06,379
attacker and then you do the attribution

745
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:12,880
in the wrong way and that's the problem

746
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:12,880
of nowadays nowadays cybersecurity

747
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,409
ecosystem I would say because it's okay

748
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,940
to have detection it to have it's okay

749
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:22,040
to have rules but you need to have more

750
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,810
it's not enough just to have like okay I

751
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:31,460
want to do detection on to the stuff in

752
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:34,520
it's not now we are moving towards the

753
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:37,820
next step and the next step is to try to

754
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:41,139
find out similarity samples I wouldn't

755
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:43,970
call it attribution per se I would say

756
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:45,889
similarity like similarity engines and

757
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:48,350
it's not only like for example we

758
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,179
doing something but also like integer is

759
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,089
also a company doing the similarity

760
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:54,980
stuff and watch out for companies who

761
00:34:53,090 --> 00:35:00,080
are doing similarity stuff because it's

762
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:02,090
super you can get like super meaningful

763
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:07,000
information and I'll tell you I'll give

764
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:10,460
you an example let's say you have this

765
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,830
like command control server and you

766
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,960
analyze the server part and then there's

767
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,759
like an encryption algorithm you can

768
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,620
apply the code similarity to the

769
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,080
encryption algorithm and then you can

770
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,180
find the client samples implementing the

771
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,180
same encryption algorithm no matter what

772
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,310
it is so it's very powerful to do this

773
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,470
kind of research and then you can find

774
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,960
new cluster of samples of new clusters

775
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:35,660
of attacks I just want to show you

776
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,880
something that I use every day and you

777
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,399
might want to use it it's called the

778
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,000
threat intelligence portal which is free

779
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,190
to use

780
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,090
like just you if you want to use it and

781
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:49,760
it's something a place where I also use

782
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:52,070
it to do like similarity and to do

783
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,110
threat intelligence research oops sorry

784
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:59,480
with this being said when like with this

785
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:02,300
page not showing god this is it try it

786
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,760
out see what if you like it it's like

787
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,320
free to use right use it if you want

788
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,930
it's like kind of kind of like

789
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,850
virustotal kind of like virustotal it

790
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,970
basically shows you what telemetry we

791
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:16,279
have 40 specific campaigns on samples

792
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,649
and malware or whatever so which is

793
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,630
being said thank you very much for for

794
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,730
being with me and sorry for the

795
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:28,619
technical inconvenience

796
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:28,619
[Applause]

797
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,870
now for someone who hasn't slept all

798
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:38,240
night you're super fresh let's take a

799
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,830
few questions we have one over here keep

800
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,390
your hands up we're gonna let's start

801
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,490
with someone in the back that sign will

802
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:47,060
promise you as well let's start with

803
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:53,450
someone there okay keep your hand up

804
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:54,230
yep Mike is there hi so on the topic of

805
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:57,020
attribution

806
00:36:54,230 --> 00:37:00,830
I know fire I have been doing it for a

807
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:03,560
long time and what fire I have been

808
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:05,150
doing is hack back as well what's your

809
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,779
opinion on track back

810
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:12,350
when you attribute the specific apt has

811
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:15,590
been targeted and a new fight back so

812
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:18,560
fire is a really good company and they

813
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:24,380
do some awesome research and I trust

814
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:28,009
their judgment on attribution though I

815
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:30,560
think that hat packback should not be

816
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:34,930
used and unfortunately more and more

817
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:40,430
companies or governments they try to

818
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:42,890
justify hack back as a ways of like

819
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:45,980
expanding their own cyber operation

820
00:37:42,890 --> 00:38:00,049
campaigns so I think they shouldn't be

821
00:37:45,980 --> 00:38:01,640
doing it but whatever you want hello

822
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,260
yeah nice presentation thanks for that

823
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,600
thank you my question would be like more

824
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,620
personal I only live because since

825
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,810
you're here and you have a lot of

826
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,060
knowledge would be like for you what is

827
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:13,250
like the coolest Margaret that you

828
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,590
analyzed personally well it's like the

829
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,660
coolest or the smartest anonymization

830
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:20,600
techniques that you found analyzing some

831
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:28,640
malware and what was like the hottest mu

832
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:31,370
LMS that you found and so part of my my

833
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,029
job I'm not doing reversing or like say

834
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:36,529
on

835
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:40,210
doing anything with samples I know that

836
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:46,120
from what my knowledge the VM protect

837
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:48,800
the DM protect package is the most

838
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:52,700
complete and the most advanced package

839
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,700
to like protect your samples but I don't

840
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,189
know any other techniques then you asked

841
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,169
about emulators no anonymization

842
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,850
techniques I was like like the coolest

843
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:06,320
and animation techniques that you found

844
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:07,940
personally or heard about it someone is

845
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,670
attacking someone and they don't want to

846
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,920
be caught only so how they do it to make

847
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:17,630
it like personally look cool but also

848
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,950
make the job so yeah I mean okay okay I

849
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,440
understand your question but the first

850
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:23,120
thing is you hack like somebody else

851
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,950
your servers and then you proxy to their

852
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,710
search through their servers yes that's

853
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:30,379
that's the first thing you do there was

854
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:32,480
another another example where you of

855
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:36,410
course you plant false flags a lot of

856
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,510
false flags in order to trick the

857
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:41,420
researchers so let me let me tell you

858
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:44,930
another story of false Flags I think I

859
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:48,200
don't know the apt actor who was doing

860
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:50,120
that but I think it was so fussy I think

861
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,759
if I don't remember if I remember

862
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:56,299
correctly basically they were like

863
00:39:52,760 --> 00:40:00,290
having a c2 server and they noticed that

864
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:02,810
researchers or people were fetching

865
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:07,300
samples so basically they noticed people

866
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:10,580
were probing them they also knew that

867
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:13,370
the IR team on the Sauk Centre they

868
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:17,450
would clean the infection so what did he

869
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:19,750
do they started giving out from that day

870
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:22,759
onward they started giving out a

871
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:25,360
different sample from a different map of

872
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,700
like Marlar let's say they were like

873
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,020
they were like russian-speaking apt and

874
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,240
they delivered the chinese-speaking

875
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:35,360
sample and then the entire stock team

876
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,240
they spent all their like days and night

877
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,530
analyzing the chinese sample when which

878
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,490
which wasn't even related to the

879
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:45,100
campaign that that's also like something

880
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,569
I think it's good awesome and last one

881
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,610
would eat Ricky was like the money

882
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,070
laundering techniques please sorry what

883
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:58,690
money laundering techniques the hottest

884
00:40:51,070 --> 00:41:10,480
one in the latest time I'm sorry let's

885
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:19,540
discuss it off topic after referrals -

886
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:21,400
what from my point of view I'm not

887
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:24,009
discussing their religion so no I think

888
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,990
I'm just discussing facts is more about

889
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,660
like are we allowed to discuss about

890
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:32,830
history can we like this is what the

891
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:35,649
world in 1939 my minutes history like

892
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,480
I'm not encouraging anything this is

893
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:40,350
basically history this is what happened

894
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,390
right that was a guy's name

895
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:45,880
okay next question hey Dan thanks for

896
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:50,650
the presentation my question is a bit

897
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:55,660
long so in terms of attribution we now

898
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:57,760
have attribution being given in public

899
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,790
advisories for example from US earth

900
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,640
which is linked to the DHS Department of

901
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:06,609
Homeland Security do you think that

902
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:10,810
that's problematic do you think given

903
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:13,509
that attribution is hard to do it

904
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:15,310
shouldn't be made public in advisories

905
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:17,290
and advisory notes and things like that

906
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:19,900
because people might act on it and draw

907
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:22,330
their own conclusion or do you think

908
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,490
it's correlated with other information

909
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:26,560
they have for example from intelligence

910
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:29,649
agencies in one case of that was the

911
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,020
attack on Sony when the government came

912
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,910
out and said it's not Korea and the

913
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,500
Security subcommittee came out and said

914
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,600
well there's no actual evidence it's

915
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,930
North Korea and later we found out the

916
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,759
NSA had probes in North Korea's servers

917
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,240
so probably they had information that

918
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:49,330
way so do you think it's it's unhealthy

919
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,729
to to give attribution to nation states

920
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:53,080
or countries in

921
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:58,690
while the reason things like that thank

922
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:02,470
you cool amazing question so about the

923
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:05,730
Sony hack actually we attributed the

924
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:08,109
link to to North Korea one month before

925
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:11,290
NSA came and actually publicly

926
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:14,020
acknowledged it was like North Korea but

927
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:16,210
the core question is of course like

928
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,740
intelligence agencies they have

929
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:21,300
information that is not publicly

930
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:23,589
available private companies they

931
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,470
generating for threat Intel that is not

932
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:30,220
publicly available we also do it as well

933
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:32,980
but I think it's I'm not sure if it's

934
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:35,950
healthy or not to put it on a public

935
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,619
register but if you do put it in a

936
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:41,740
public register you have to say why like

937
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:44,950
what's your it's not enough to say we

938
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:48,729
attribute this to North Korea a better

939
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:50,830
way to do it is say we have low medium

940
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:54,840
high confidence this is attributed to

941
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:59,799
North Korea and the reasons are for

942
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:01,240
example log from a VPN server and they

943
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,260
logged in from North Korea

944
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,879
so like this is how we attributed the

945
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,710
lazarus like we found the connection

946
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,040
from a North Korean IP address there are

947
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:14,650
no VPNs in North Korea or like this

948
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,750
sample resembles another sample or what

949
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:20,020
we found this this and that it's very

950
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:22,510
important to say why but my feeling is

951
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:26,470
that you shouldn't do the attribution

952
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:28,600
let the others do it or just like don't

953
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,730
do attribution just say okay this is the

954
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,440
advisory disorder Yara rules or Allah

955
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,410
protect yourself you don't have to like

956
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:39,609
does it matter where the model came from

957
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:42,190
also I wouldn't trust the US said that

958
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:43,509
much mostly because they have like

959
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:46,000
shitty error rules

960
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:49,000
one reason no but they don't have like

961
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:56,530
also some rules that didn't work so they

962
00:44:49,000 --> 00:45:03,340
have to work on that part there ok

963
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:04,270
please stand now this year german

964
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,760
journalist

965
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:08,830
call Eichenberg Eichenberg discovered

966
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,830
that because pesky antivirus was

967
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:15,900
injecting JavaScript code into basically

968
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:17,319
everybody's every single users websites

969
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,290
effectively acting as a

970
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,630
man-in-the-middle I have a very simple

971
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:26,320
question what were you guys thinking why

972
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:29,470
doing that so the bug that you're

973
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:32,770
referring to is correct it was in the

974
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:35,410
module like it was in the web module

975
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:39,850
which I think it needs a little bit more

976
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:42,850
of reworking the the way how you can

977
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:44,950
protect against web attacks is you need

978
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:48,430
to see the traffic and basically you

979
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:51,189
need to be able to like intercept like

980
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:55,230
to see if there's only some weird things

981
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:58,360
going the what happened is that the

982
00:45:55,230 --> 00:46:00,550
JavaScript that was requested injected

983
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,830
in into the page in order to protect the

984
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:06,010
users which by the way you can turn off

985
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:09,670
the the option the JavaScript that was

986
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:14,710
injected was different basically

987
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:16,600
allowing you to allowing you to use the

988
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:18,310
X requested from that location user

989
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:22,029
while cases from the other location it

990
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:24,460
was based on the idea like IDs and that

991
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:27,010
was a bug and clearly I did the

992
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,840
up like development in up I don't

993
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:31,540
work on the antivirus but they did

994
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,070
up well now they're requesting is from a

995
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,529
standard on location blah blah blah blah

996
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,300
blah but the question is like it's the

997
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,820
eternal question like okay you don't

998
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:42,610
trust the antivirus to protect you how

999
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:45,160
can the enterprise protect you like sure

1000
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:47,020
it's up to you to decide but that was a

1001
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,930
bug that and it was fixed

1002
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:55,380
I think to me trahana like last question

1003
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:55,379
yes question because out

1004
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,600
please use the mic so what about Iranian

1005
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:13,010
government attribution done in less than

1006
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:16,020
24 hours sorry what there were some some

1007
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:18,300
websites being hacked last summer or

1008
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,290
public institutions and we've seen some

1009
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,290
press releases

1010
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:25,170
pointing at China Chinese actors in less

1011
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:28,920
than 24 hours yeah I don't think it's

1012
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:32,160
like wise to just jump the ship and say

1013
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,840
like it's dammit because we found they

1014
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,850
were connecting to a Chinese server or

1015
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,760
some I don't know what was the time

1016
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:41,430
frame even better the time frame yeah I

1017
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,920
wouldn't trust attribution solely on

1018
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:47,040
time frame I wouldn't trust Edition Sony

1019
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,940
or on debug strings on strings in the

1020
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,770
malware because again false Flags it's

1021
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,080
okay to do attribution but you have to

1022
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:59,430
specify why and your reasoning needs to

1023
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:04,380
be like strong thank you thank you

1024
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:04,379
[Applause]
