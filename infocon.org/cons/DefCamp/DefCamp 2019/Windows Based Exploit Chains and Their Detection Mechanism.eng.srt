1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
I will start the presentation by just

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,170
providing you like the mandatory about

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:10,080
Me section after that I will talk about

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,639
the exploits change what are they then a

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,990
bit of even causation and process

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,880
monitoring so as you told me I'm a

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,420
research fellow at NTNU I'm also doing

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,038
my PhD from there I am like I receive

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,099
like an innovation innovation metal from

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,949
Interpol for developing future smart

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,929
cities concepts I am also a member of

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,890
their verdicts per group on smart city

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:38,160
placing I also involved in strategic

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,410
level policymaking in Norway and I also

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,709
really recently led their joint

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,078
civil-military team on cyber strategy in

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,239
a recent 912 challenge I am also

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,520
involved in the training of selection of

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,419
the national team for European cyber

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,730
security challenge

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,039
and in term of my serve game I have like

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,769
18 plus certification I think this is

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,600
which include LP d OS CPC so many I

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,070
don't remember how many but there are

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,049
many so what is their exploitation so an

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,669
exploit chain is a group of expert that

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,369
exhibited synchronously in order to

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,170
achieve the system exploitation like

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,850
high respond abilities they have system

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,159
exploitation using only one eyes

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,449
equation step and exploitation takes

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,000
advantage of multiple vulnerabilities

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,150
low and medium low risk on the abilities

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,600
to get the system level privilege or to

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,490
compromise it so when we see like a

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,869
single vulnerability exploitation we see

37
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,199
like they have like a very simple graph

38
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,210
so you just start identify visibility

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,040
like a major vulnerability like in an

40
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,689
assembly like it or not exploit it and

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,270
you will have like the priority of the

42
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,710
whole system so these are some of the

43
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,820
examples of like high risk of abilities

44
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,750
that can be exploited like within one

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,130
execution step but in exploit a change

46
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,840
you see like you find out when the

47
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,630
ability you exploit it but after you

48
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,540
exploit it you get a lot of data that

49
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,250
you use that data to identify other

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,040
explore other vulnerabilities and

51
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,110
explore them so like yesterday there was

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,110
like a micro zero day initiative was

53
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,840
going on so like the flow set

54
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,569
do you like again exploited

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,069
as perform like an explosion from

56
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,970
integer overflow in a JavaScript

57
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:25,850
retrieval of like an image from a

58
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:30,569
samsung phone through NFC communication

59
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:33,060
so we know these things like exploits

60
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,640
chains and what are they and how they

61
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,230
are being exploited in the wild but is

62
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,269
there a way to detect them because if

63
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,149
you detect like a single vulnerability

64
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,860
you know like this is like the

65
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,690
low-hanging fruit you can patch them but

66
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,340
in terms of explosions you have like

67
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,000
multiple low-hanging fruits that are

68
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,010
very hard to detect okay so even if you

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,030
patch like one vulnerability they can

70
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,269
find another so there was actually like

71
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,450
a very good work that was going on in

72
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:05,580
Japan shot so they released like a very

73
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,619
major report so this research is based

74
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,730
upon their report so if I have seen

75
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,930
further it is by standing on the

76
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,459
shoulders of this so they were actually

77
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,340
the Giants so I am giving them full

78
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,670
credit so they released this report in

79
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,400
like early 2017 about detecting lateral

80
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,260
movement within a network so this is a

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,290
very important report if you don't know

82
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,560
it like as a blue guy or as a forensics

83
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:32,700
guy then not doing it right

84
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,290
so in this report they talked about the

85
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,328
exploitation tools that are used by

86
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,410
different hackers like mimikatz

87
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:42,510
meterpreter and Metasploit and the type

88
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,269
of logs which they generate so they

89
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,070
created a very long list of logs windows

90
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,040
logs that are generated by the usage of

91
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,739
those tools the only problem with this

92
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,450
report is that they have like the

93
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,120
information about the logs that are

94
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:00,209
generated by free tools like Metasploit

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,859
and other but if you go for like bail to

96
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,940
like vaults like you can't get the

97
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:07,430
information of the logs that were

98
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,320
generated by them so if we think about

99
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,390
our priorities in terms of security

100
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,700
there is a lot of buzz about machine

101
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,108
learning and blockchain but I will show

102
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,238
you like the most important things are

103
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:19,620
the even logs as suggested by this me

104
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,959
this is the only memory in the whole

105
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,210
presentation so I am actually focusing

106
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,650
on the event log that is process

107
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:30,340
creation event so this is the

108
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,919
eventid force excited it did you can see

109
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,289
a lot of information was there in this

110
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,419
image log but how we can use this

111
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:39,550
informations so it have like new process

112
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,859
ID process name process ID command-line

113
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,470
arguments those were the main important

114
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,330
point of interests and from the same

115
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,789
report we got the information what type

116
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,560
of processes a hacker can use after like

117
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,710
an exploitation so these are some of the

118
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,380
major processes that if a system is

119
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,419
exploited a hacker can use to gain

120
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,520
further please like CMD PowerShell let

121
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,260
this be an under NDA later or you can

122
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,880
monitor any process if you want but

123
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,010
these are the major processes so I am

124
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,810
focusing when those processes so I

125
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,159
developed an algorithm they take the

126
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,750
information from the event logs and

127
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,639
collate the information with the

128
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,660
processes that are being running and I

129
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,690
didn't try to identify like some sort of

130
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,669
activity malicious activity from one

131
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,219
process to another process how he is

132
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:28,419
moving and how is he like exploiting the

133
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,250
vulnerabilities so this is a like an

134
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:32,830
algorithm is like a word used by

135
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,840
programmer when they do not want to

136
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,870
explain what they did so this was like

137
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:42,159
the algorithm looks like it looks a bit

138
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:47,169
scary maybe understandable so what it do

139
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:49,240
I took any like list of event logs what

140
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,400
ordered list of even logs and try to

141
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,320
identify like the information from them

142
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,359
I can explain it like in a very easy

143
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,949
manner so these are the ever locks and

144
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,139
these are the important process

145
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,729
information that we are looking for we

146
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:04,960
are looking for process ID new process

147
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:08,740
ID and process ID those are hexadecimal

148
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,070
values and both are unique so check this

149
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:16,030
event log you can see its new poor

150
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:19,150
society and process ID now if we go that

151
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,989
did you find anything similar if we look

152
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,940
through so that was like a CMB that was

153
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,949
like a partial process and there is a

154
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,349
like a CMD process and if you see like

155
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:32,979
this X process ID was actually the new

156
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:34,990
process ID of the CMD process so the CMD

157
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,969
process actually executed that of

158
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,729
PowerShell process if we go further down

159
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:40,389
in the row we have like a vmware

160
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,508
processor

161
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,849
so from that VMware process we can see

162
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,879
like that vmware process has a new

163
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:51,188
process ID of q70 and that executed like

164
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,900
a CMD process so we have like a chain

165
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,330
like a vmware it's hard to imagine that

166
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,789
a vm we are executing a CMD but i will

167
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,530
show you how they are doing this so they

168
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,330
have like very famous guest to host

169
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,628
exploit so even if you are monitoring

170
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,280
the vmware host guest running in it you

171
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:09,310
are not sure if somebody exploit there's

172
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,590
process isolation he can break the

173
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,409
vmware isolation and move into the host

174
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,779
OS but in the host OS the logs are

175
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:18,938
coming like in the recursive manner so

176
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:20,889
you see like the timeline is like this

177
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,770
first the vmware process was executed

178
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:26,949
after that CMD process was executed

179
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,508
after the powershell process but when

180
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,580
you are reading the logs from the even

181
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:32,469
logs you see you will read first the

182
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,198
partial process after that you will read

183
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:38,110
the CMD process after that you will read

184
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,240
the process so you have to read in a

185
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,319
backward manner so you have to look back

186
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,569
in time what is happening so when we get

187
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,389
our hands dirty a bit so there is like

188
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,770
example of like naturalness Dede he

189
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:52,180
follows the same suit I have like a

190
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,549
whole publication that is explaining

191
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,639
about the type of vulnerability there is

192
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:00,759
exploiting so you can see like which was

193
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:09,569
like a snapshot from processor so you

194
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:12,789
could see like PowerShell CMD and a

195
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:17,500
portion impaired we can from it and same

196
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:19,960
with the VMware so you can see the thing

197
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,900
like how it is moving you know no one's

198
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,349
seen are you not expect to happen but

199
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,359
yeah and it is like very raw log from

200
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,949
the detection algorithm like you can see

201
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:37,000
like how the expert chain is working how

202
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:43,000
the things are going one there so during

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,529
this testing or development of this we

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,399
needed some sort of zero today's exploit

205
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:50,020
to prove our point so there is like an

206
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,140
exploit of my products degree version so

207
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,220
what we did was like we weaponized in in

208
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,470
a PowerPoint

209
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,150
and uploaded it on virustotal and the

210
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:04,750
the verbalized version was like zero

211
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:07,480
detection but the PowerPoint was signed

212
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,510
by my name so there was a very famous

213
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,460
researcher from fireEye he detected that

214
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,810
represent of PowerPoint extract and then

215
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,460
he was actually tagging me on the

216
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:20,140
Twitter that is this guy's actually

217
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:22,330
exploding those things then like in July

218
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,160
this year I met one of his colleague

219
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,100
marina corte Olaf I think many of you

220
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,400
know him so I told her about that story

221
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,680
and then they like caught it like from

222
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,540
my impressive comment too much from

223
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,030
attribution to a witty sample and taken

224
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,459
down in stone so we can argue that like

225
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:43,540
our train of like way of testing the

226
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,040
thing works but you know things like you

227
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,290
know like there is some sort of activity

228
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,319
going on but what exactly the activity

229
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,689
is going on this thing in the whole

230
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,220
exploitation so you didn't see like the

231
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,840
processor moving up and down but what

232
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,050
are they are actually doing so if we

233
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,320
analyze the image log again we can see

234
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,849
that there was this command-line

235
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,220
argument we can get the information from

236
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:10,690
this command line argument so but we we

237
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,670
can see this come online report but

238
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,310
there are like google ways to like open

239
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,040
like a single calico XZ so you see like

240
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,770
you can open collect like this like this

241
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,699
like this like this like this it will

242
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:26,680
open can so it would like confuse the

243
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,230
defender this is like the research of

244
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,849
Josephus kitchen done by Daniel

245
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,530
beforehand so he provided like a whole

246
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,940
frame framework to like off escape

247
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:39,130
commands so even if you are like trying

248
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,420
to detect VI Kamala and I were to be

249
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,580
very hard because the commands will be

250
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,199
alpha scary if the attacker is like AB

251
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,500
it's not so it would be very hard for

252
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,440
you to detect it but here we can use the

253
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,020
good old machine learning because we

254
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,730
should use it where we can where it is

255
00:10:53,020 --> 00:11:00,280
usable so this is like the data set from

256
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,610
radial the sofas kitchen shoes so we use

257
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,530
this data set in order to turn our

258
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,020
machine learning algorithm we identify

259
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:12,699
like four different classification

260
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:17,230
types on this we like live base elitism

261
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,000
and we were able to achieve like in most

262
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,020
of the classification categories in more

263
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,880
than 90 percent accuracy

264
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,620
so it was like a natural language

265
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,830
processing techniques in which we use

266
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,870
the bucket of words so it can like check

267
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,480
the words and match them from the

268
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,630
command so you can easily identify like

269
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,190
a lot of different categories these are

270
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:40,240
some of the results from the 50:14

271
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,459
classification techniques from porsche

272
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,720
powershell uninstalling software using

273
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:48,160
the logs like my binary planting and

274
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,200
stuff like that so you can use this

275
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,520
machine learning techniques very well in

276
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:57,160
this context so I made this research

277
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,079
public and everything is accessible in

278
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,660
two publications the first was like in

279
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,040
San Francisco where I discussed the

280
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,980
windows-based expert can guess to

281
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,860
exploit with VMware research head and

282
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,680
the second was also in Romania it was

283
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,500
like combining of this natural language

284
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,160
processing techniques on the algorithms

285
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,970
on the image logs so why would take so

286
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,560
much effort in this technique because

287
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:27,670
there are a lot of same solutions and

288
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:30,939
what you called like like stuff like

289
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,589
this that doing a lot of stuff but but

290
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,110
we I am actually working on Norwegian

291
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:36,700
cyber range it's like a 7 million euro

292
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,740
project so in which we do a lot of

293
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,630
cybersecurity exercises for those

294
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,410
cybersecurity exercises like in normal

295
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,360
scenario you use like flags like

296
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:50,350
hexadecimal values there is a static

297
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,870
that an hacker can get them and put them

298
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,390
in a scoreboard and receive that points

299
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,550
but the way that technique which I

300
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:01,149
implemented is getting the event logs

301
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,770
from different device different devices

302
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:04,959
present within a city of platform and

303
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,779
from those even logs can identify the

304
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,160
movement of like the players like how

305
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,750
they are moving how the Explorer are

306
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,670
using and what type of techniques they

307
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,820
are using after that we can score them

308
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,939
automatically based upon the things

309
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,940
thank you

310
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,879
[Applause]

311
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,399
thank you for your presentation now are

312
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:31,160
there any questions I'm just gonna go to

313
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,810
the closest one to man thanks for the

314
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,089
presentation awesome stuff

315
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,369
love the Bitcoin sticker really cool and

316
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,870
you have such a great curriculum so my

317
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,910
question would be more personal and

318
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,130
based on your presentation like you did

319
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:48,199
so much stuff what was like the most

320
00:13:43,130 --> 00:14:00,410
mind-blowing thing that you have done in

321
00:13:48,200 --> 00:14:04,520
new world Korea so I social engineer my

322
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:09,040
way to get a photo so that was a very

323
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:12,260
interesting photo so we were in like

324
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,270
very isolated place in Finch sake so

325
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,040
there was like the cryptographer heavens

326
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,750
like addition Meade was there John

327
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,640
diamond was there and all the

328
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,529
cryptographic words were there so when

329
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,630
he was presenting he studied his

330
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,149
presentation he took like a selfie for

331
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,860
his girlfriend after his presentation I

332
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:29,240
asked can you give me that he said no

333
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,480
you have to take that constant of

334
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,120
everybody do gdpr I said okay so we were

335
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,339
there like for a week so in Norway when

336
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,500
we have like lunch or dinner we said

337
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:41,480
together and then somebody have to like

338
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,850
pour water in everybody glass so what I

339
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,300
did was I took the mood glass of water

340
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:49,550
with me and pour water in everybody

341
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,359
class except me is for two days he was

342
00:14:49,550 --> 00:15:02,240
so not happy with that and he just gave

343
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:10,880
me by the way I can show you that for if

344
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:12,589
you want hi so not not yet but we open

345
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:19,339
sourced it so anybody can use it

346
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:22,610
okay yeah we have a lot of false

347
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:24,020
positive but you know like it is

348
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,899
currently used for like scoring purposes

349
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,709
but maybe in future maybe we use it like

350
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:29,709
for actual detection

351
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,199
hello thank you for the presentation my

352
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,449
question is for you personally what is

353
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,820
the most operating system that has the

354
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,700
most security vulnerabilities or

355
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,950
exploits I can't answer these questions

356
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:52,560
because it's all depends upon the user

357
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:59,850
yeah how he is using it thank you any

358
00:15:52,560 --> 00:16:01,709
more non-debatable questions hi so my

359
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:05,209
question is the machine learning that

360
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:14,010
you use for natural language processing

361
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:16,260
or only work on command lines or exactly

362
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:20,339
do you use natural language to detect

363
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:25,050
malware because yeah so when you use

364
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:29,670
like like normal machinery it actually

365
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,829
divides the words into small chunks okay

366
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,779
small bites so you can have like a

367
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,029
matching scheme with those buts

368
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,250
so it have like allocate a percentage to

369
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,110
those how much percent this chunk of

370
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:44,130
bytes match with those chunk of bytes in

371
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,360
order to classify according to the given

372
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:53,510
requirements so you have like a

373
00:16:45,360 --> 00:17:10,679
classifier that specify the things so

374
00:16:53,510 --> 00:17:13,230
language part comes in I mean the

375
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,300
technique is like this so when we speak

376
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,970
to our phone like for it convert into

377
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,829
like text so that text is actually being

378
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,020
classified based upon some set of

379
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,169
criteria so this is like the same thing

380
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:28,530
but in term of like translating English

381
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,540
from a phone I used like malicious cow

382
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,340
commands data set from danger boom and

383
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,350
run and to train in this data

384
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,750
so my classifier was trained on those

385
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:40,719
malicious commands not okay I think I

386
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:47,559
get it Thanks any more questions

387
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:55,990
I could you please tell me what is the

388
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:59,200
latest strand in Windows abilities there

389
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,940
is like used to be like a very I don't

390
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,580
know people know about it there was like

391
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,009
an expert like eternal it has like a

392
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,889
derivative I don't know most people know

393
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:11,049
about it at the eternal romance if your

394
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,809
system is not configured lightly people

395
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:18,879
can do a lot of stuff right now

396
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:25,960
the name was quite good any more

397
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:28,240
questions in terms of your software once

398
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,059
once you've deployed it onto a network

399
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,279
it'll take event logs from all the

400
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:36,250
computers around the network does it

401
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,679
then have does it have any protection at

402
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,049
this stage or is it just information

403
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:45,399
informational return that comes back to

404
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:47,679
you so I forgot to talk about it so when

405
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:49,209
you have to like domain environment like

406
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,889
an Active Directory environment you can

407
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,840
get all the logs from the like the

408
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:54,459
systems ok then you can process the

409
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,928
information the limitation of the

410
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,059
software was like that it can like works

411
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:00,730
on like maybe three have set of 300

412
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:02,019
computers so now we can host like in our

413
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,700
cyber and we can host I can exercise

414
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,529
roughly 300 parties but it can work on

415
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,169
that but if you put it like an

416
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:09,610
enterprise environment where there are

417
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,559
like millions of nodes or maybe like

418
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:22,059
hundred thousand nodes that's where it

419
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:29,139
will feel like in seconds your

420
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:31,509
application just just just currently

421
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:33,699
just for scoring for making like things

422
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:35,500
like that guy was there so we can look

423
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,090
at some point automatically so we can

424
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,830
have like a track of like people who are

425
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:43,090
like actually moving within the network

426
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:44,649
like students so if you compare it with

427
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,209
the real scenario if you have a hacker

428
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:47,979
in your network so you can track the

429
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,730
activity that how is moving laterally

430
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,730
within the network
