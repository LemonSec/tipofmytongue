1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,910
our next speaker was actually on the

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,980
death camps aged 2 years ago and today

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,910
he's coming to us with a different story

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,070
he has tons of InfoSec experience and

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,520
some really great insights to share with

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,250
you so please do you know take notes

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,980
take pictures whatever you'd like so you

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,710
can take this with you and make the most

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,500
of it after deaf camp so it is my

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,300
pleasure to welcome on stage steve

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,230
mcgregor ephraim ixia a key side

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:38,790
business

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:42,269
let's give him a good welcome all right

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,960
hello good afternoon appreciate you

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,020
joining good to be here really excited I

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,000
run a the security research team I dig

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,920
see icky side business they're based

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,289
here in Romania I spent the week with

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,440
them beautiful week thank you for the

20
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,079
weather the team we work on test and

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,459
measurement we do security research and

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,490
we perform build products that perform

23
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:11,429
security testing on network equipment

24
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:15,419
security products and personally I'm a

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,310
I'm a father and back yard again which

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,080
means basically I like to go out into

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,720
the farm and do other things outside of

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:27,689
the city two years ago I was here I

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:30,990
wanted to express something and this is

30
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:34,979
a continuation of my journey in cyber

31
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,259
security I have done intrusion

32
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,689
prevention systems I've worked an IT of

33
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,479
denardi throughout networking building

34
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,339
network Mis management systems in the

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,320
last 10 years building security products

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,689
and throughout my career what I've

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,179
noticed is pretty I'm pretty disgruntled

38
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,490
like probably a lot of you but the

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,770
industry kills me and so I'm gonna just

40
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,110
go back I have nothing against

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,420
Metasploit there is nothing against

42
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,270
sharing is caring that's not really what

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,459
I'm gonna say is wrong the problem is

44
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,609
that the industry the way we do things

45
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,940
tends to leave a lot of people behind

46
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,780
and they get hacked so when Metasploit

47
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:22,100
has a module that can be exploited it

48
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:25,500
tends to be available to anyone and

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:29,040
somewhere in the range of 30 to plus

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,170
percent hacks will come from Metasploit

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,780
modules and I'm not going to go into the

52
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,570
details about this but the the story was

53
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,980
that it was an ode a coming from my my

54
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,560
friends at tipping point where I used to

55
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,500
work it's zero day initiative the

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,650
Metasploit module was actually leaked

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,800
before it was actually a patched there

58
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,870
is a time where this thing was available

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,800
to anyone and even after it was patched

60
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,390
as we know patching is not always easy I

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,210
actually wanna cries a great example

62
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,299
Microsoft released the SMB v1 patch in

63
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:06,150
17 days later wanna cry happened killed

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,240
a bunch of computers ransomware really

65
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,930
bad thing and we knew it but the rest of

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:16,800
the world doesn't know it and so I had

67
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,690
my first quote basically we armed cyber

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,520
criminals with exploits who then take

69
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,120
advantage of the rest of the world that

70
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,850
was my talk in 2017 and that's thanks to

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,160
us I'm back because at the end of my

72
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,799
talk I was asked will it get better and

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,489
what can we do to make it better and I'm

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:39,470
on that journey to try and help as all

75
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:42,420
of you are and so now I'm back to help

76
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,769
of course the number one thing is

77
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,018
awareness we're all trying to do right

78
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,510
here unfortunately the rest of the world

79
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,390
is not here today it quickly drops off

80
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,329
the face of the world when we leave this

81
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:59,179
room people don't know what we know

82
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:04,110
that's a problem the ability for us to

83
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:07,440
defend ourselves is coming around that's

84
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,040
why we're here very silly question who

85
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,470
do you want to hack your network alright

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,048
it's got a simple answer I think you

87
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,149
don't want either but the truth is no

88
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,710
matter what you do these guys are doing

89
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:24,388
it another thing about the industry is

90
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,599
we've focused a lot

91
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:30,750
prevention and as we see with our

92
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:33,360
products in our lab the prevention

93
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,669
capabilities are not good at all the

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,650
best performance and a lot of detection

95
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:40,139
or prevention that we can get from

96
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,250
vendors is and it depends some things

97
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:48,740
that can get really well 80 90 100 % web

98
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,210
browser attacks is low bars like 48 50 %

99
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,969
ability to block web browser attacks

100
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,489
this is not what the marketing teams

101
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:58,830
will tell you there's not going to tell

102
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,599
you hey we only do 48 percent of it no

103
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,870
they're gonna make you think they do all

104
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:08,520
of it and that's a problem because it's

105
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:11,099
not true and we all know that because

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,188
that it's not true because breaches

107
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:20,938
remain or compromises that turn into

108
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:23,099
breaches remain unknown for months the

109
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,960
thing I've been trying to guide people

110
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:29,849
into and this is a technology I think

111
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,099
that well start off with knowing what's

112
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:34,229
in your network ok so what are you

113
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:37,740
trying to defend alright this is a great

114
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:40,199
thing to know the other side of it is

115
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,099
don't always count on the prevention

116
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,860
look for detection and noise reduction

117
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:49,589
this is something we've had worked on

118
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,839
previously and and came out with some

119
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,719
products to try to help with machine

120
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,039
learning technologies I find it very

121
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:59,250
positive from them in the fact that

122
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,589
they're really good at taking Big Data

123
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,050
Lakes processing and narrowing down

124
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:06,779
something for you to look at right so

125
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,960
these are things that we can all do but

126
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:12,180
there's something else we can all do and

127
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,878
it's something that most of us have

128
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:20,279
never done alright and it's test

129
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:23,639
let me ask real quick raise your hands

130
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:27,930
please how many of you have a lab to

131
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:30,990
test okay that's you know generally I

132
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,069
see about 5% hands through every time I

133
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,789
ask that question how many have a

134
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,719
production network it's supposed to be

135
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:42,719
all of you but

136
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:45,058
I mean you're awake alright let's I know

137
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,949
just absence all right if you can't

138
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:48,779
measure it you can't improve it very

139
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,949
true how do you know Security's working

140
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,469
it's difficult this is one of the most

141
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,119
difficult things to to assess security

142
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:56,308
it's easier to tell the weather I can

143
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:58,229
just look out the window right I know

144
00:06:56,309 --> 00:07:00,689
that what the weather is tomorrow that's

145
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:03,239
a lot harder for the weather trying to

146
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:05,099
assess where you are how effective are

147
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:08,369
the devices that you deployed you know

148
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:10,679
how do you get there right it's hard but

149
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:13,110
it's something you have to do in order

150
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,708
to improve something right you have no

151
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,659
idea

152
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:18,179
unless you can test it measure it and

153
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:23,149
then compare it the next day after

154
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:25,799
making changes right so the maturity

155
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,269
levels that tried to find the most

156
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,809
simple one I've been using this quite

157
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:34,050
some time it's it's very effective that

158
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:37,769
we all start at level one great that's

159
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,749
yes and level five is where we would

160
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,879
like to be the only way we can get to

161
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:44,309
level five is if we can measure and

162
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:48,239
optimize right so we have to be able to

163
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:51,300
test measure find weaknesses buying

164
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:53,698
strengths both of those are very good a

165
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,279
very difficult question to answer

166
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:59,159
I see so is going to want to know hey

167
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:02,279
have I spent enough actually they're

168
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:05,069
gonna ask have I spent too much right

169
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,949
that's the likely one so testing can

170
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:11,879
help them understand that right and

171
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:13,139
today we have as options vulnerability

172
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:18,929
assessment if you're looking at the

173
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:20,459
you're my my right your left you can run

174
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:23,938
vulnerability assessment you can do this

175
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,139
continuously do it a lot it is going to

176
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,089
point out what you have in your network

177
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,949
that's very good it's gonna hopefully

178
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,509
find some vulnerabilities we all know

179
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,329
patching though on the sidelines is

180
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:35,789
really hard it's not easy you all know

181
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:39,899
what's there wouldn't it be great if I

182
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:41,968
could say well we are vulnerable but our

183
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,379
defenses are working or I'll know if

184
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:47,699
someone tries to take advantage of that

185
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:48,560
okay so we bring in things like pin test

186
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:51,290
or

187
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,949
team exercises these are things that

188
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,160
take a lot of time they don't happen as

189
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:02,360
often but on the other hand you get

190
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,550
human intuition love it great we need it

191
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,470
but you do it once a year it's I don't

192
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,969
know maybe hopefully quarterly if you do

193
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,920
it monthly you're doing it a lot more

194
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:16,150
than most people so someone said and his

195
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,400
name is me the solution of security is

196
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:22,430
automation of self hacking and

197
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,760
remediation think about it today what

198
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,380
we're doing is at human pace we talked

199
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,930
about machine learning machine learns

200
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,939
taking big data it's cranking it point

201
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,770
you down to hey what should I look at

202
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,630
today what are the things that I should

203
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,420
focus on what are the things that look

204
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:42,680
to be bad having humans try to do that

205
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:45,110
it's impossible so I'm here to say the

206
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,599
answer to our cybersecurity woes will

207
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,270
come from automated testing and

208
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,580
automated remediation when you can the

209
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,060
test measure find something and then

210
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,370
turn around with an automation

211
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:01,510
remediation we're gonna be way further

212
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,510
down the road than we are today

213
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:09,579
now I'm going to start to introduce a

214
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,580
new technology that's starting to emerge

215
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,480
compared to what you do when you try to

216
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:18,680
pin test you have to set up vulnerable

217
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:22,490
systems you have to you know perhaps

218
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,250
scan your own Grill physical or services

219
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,690
right it takes a good bit of time

220
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,610
there's a new thing coming out called

221
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,370
breach and attack simulation tools and

222
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,250
we'll talk more about this as you get

223
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,560
through but it will bring in automated

224
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,890
testing that's done very similar to Red

225
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,250
Team penetration testing you can run it

226
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,560
continuously and it will help you

227
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,810
measure your security and since it's

228
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,969
automated it can be run you can schedule

229
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,219
it and run it and do it over and it can

230
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,950
be done by just about anyone we have a

231
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:58,120
skill shortage we have a resource

232
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:00,470
shortage we need something like that

233
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,959
where to practice

234
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:06,290
the answer came when everyone raised

235
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,479
their hand of course you know we all

236
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,099
have production networks but if you want

237
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,980
to learn you want to get started you can

238
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,550
work in a sandbox you can actually spin

239
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,350
up servers you could do this

240
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,389
my recommendation is your production

241
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,399
network is where you should be looking

242
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:25,850
it's where the hackers are trying to get

243
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,970
to why are you not also looking at it in

244
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:31,220
such a way so production networks this

245
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,509
is where the wars being fought that's

246
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,949
where all the changes are occurring

247
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,949
these are the things that we're trying

248
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:40,459
to keep up with it's the only constant

249
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:43,310
we have right it's changed every day we

250
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:47,689
get updates patches new technology being

251
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:52,329
put together we have skills people who

252
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:55,579
leave the company so all of this is

253
00:11:52,329 --> 00:12:00,410
causing us to fight a losing battle

254
00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:02,899
today it's hard to keep up with let's

255
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,790
get into hacking ourselves all right

256
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:08,810
that's where some of my ugly slides come

257
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,730
in sorry apologize I love it keep it

258
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:15,619
simple

259
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:18,889
Steve that's what I say but it's I think

260
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:21,139
it's keep it simple strategy ask

261
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:22,759
yourself questions right I love to ask

262
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:25,759
questions already asked you guys a

263
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,779
couple questions I like to learn as much

264
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,000
I can

265
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,920
what is the next-gen firewall what is it

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,709
supposed to do for me this is a good

267
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,899
question well how do you get there how

268
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,638
about a search engine well give you some

269
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,380
information about these things and you

270
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,750
can start to investigate what is

271
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,430
application awareness deep packet

272
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,910
inspection what is deep packet

273
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:49,008
inspection this is a great point many

274
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,089
people think that it means looking at

275
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:54,920
port 80 and that's web traffic right

276
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:57,769
that's not deep packet inspection if

277
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,699
it's on port 22:13 it should be able to

278
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:03,740
recognize this HP traffic this is a

279
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:05,779
great killer that we're running into

280
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,329
quite a bit because you don't know how

281
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:10,220
ineffective your security controls are

282
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:13,569
when the when the traffic is encrypted

283
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:17,589
right and TLS one three it's starting to

284
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,820
in a femoral key encryption so you have

285
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,430
to be man-in-the-middle

286
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:26,589
I threw some code in therefore you'll

287
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:28,209
get the get the slides so example how

288
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,579
can I make sure that my next-gen

289
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:32,199
firewall is web content filter I don't

290
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:34,269
know how many lines of code that is and

291
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:37,089
someone that writes code all day will go

292
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:39,519
that's ugly and find a bug in it yes I

293
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,560
wrote it in five minutes and put this

294
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,910
but it's easy enough for me to do it you

295
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,380
could write something to pull down

296
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:50,319
websites did this every day cron job Hey

297
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:54,040
is it still effective our ski site IT

298
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:56,589
guys told me because I worked with them

299
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,980
they didn't know one of the parts our

300
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:00,850
advices it's very good name vendors was

301
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,040
not working

302
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,959
this would have pointed out they said it

303
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,689
went a month or so before they found out

304
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,859
there you go continuous checking on your

305
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,670
next-gen firewalls deep packet

306
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,560
inspection web content filtering

307
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,719
sandboxing ok sandboxing technology is

308
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,268
important especially because humans get

309
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,750
emails emails are phishing or malware

310
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:24,760
fouls sandbox team will check that file

311
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,449
before it gets to you it could also be

312
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,430
in a next-gen firewall they'll extract

313
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:34,000
payloads out of HP or email and look at

314
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,459
it and try to find it right so how would

315
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,589
you go about testing his sandbox I had a

316
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:42,729
buddy that works with me he did some

317
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:44,500
testings I'm stealing from him he he put

318
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,819
a lot of vendors together figure it out

319
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,560
from their marketing what they were

320
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,969
supposed to do how they're supposed to

321
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,279
do it we knew what they're supposed to

322
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:56,290
do there's not the same coverage right

323
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,310
so this is showing three different

324
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,899
vendors and whether or not they can

325
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:05,949
based on marketing detect things right

326
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:08,709
so we narrowed it down to ok these are

327
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:12,459
ones they also say yes great then we

328
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:16,300
take a selection of different CVEs

329
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:19,420
documents exploits sent it send it

330
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:23,380
through them and we found a very

331
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,760
interesting one and which there's our

332
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,970
friend Metasploit so I get something

333
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,970
back

334
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,320
Metasploit shows up again Metasploit

335
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,079
shows up there's a module anyone can use

336
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,120
it

337
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,850
your sandboxing if your vendor 3 did not

338
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,590
work these results are useful when I

339
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,930
because now you know that information

340
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,610
that's what's important about it what

341
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,010
can you do making informed decisions

342
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:52,280
this is why it's important to test your

343
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,500
stuff all right I'm gonna jump into

344
00:15:52,280 --> 00:16:00,860
who's coming after you and what they're

345
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:02,510
using and the thing that I it always

346
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,070
blows my mind when I go ahead and talk

347
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,750
to everyone and find out what tools and

348
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,370
that are being used and what they find

349
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,860
when they do instant response is that

350
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:13,160
they're not always advanced it's

351
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,750
expensive to retool there's the tools

352
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,630
and the software and the products are

353
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,790
out there a PT's advanced persistent

354
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,480
threats you can check them there's

355
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,329
mightor in the u.s. really like what

356
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,010
they're doing with this attack framework

357
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:30,320
the website has a lot of information

358
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,750
it's being heavily used by these new

359
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,580
breach in attack simulation tools but

360
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,610
you can go out you can research you can

361
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:40,070
figure out based on a PT's what industry

362
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,150
they've they're going after right if

363
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,280
you're in health care you're in

364
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,140
government or you're in technology you

365
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,270
can look you can find out what tools

366
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:53,120
they're using these tools are readily

367
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:56,180
available for anyone right there kali

368
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,420
linux and the big one empire has who

369
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,660
here has heard of empire yeah you

370
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,510
probably got it in your network so

371
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,909
because it's like 70 to 80% of instant

372
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,709
responses to find empire because it's

373
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,360
power show we ran in a windows and every

374
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,920
windows box has power show and it's this

375
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,458
thing is really good obfuscating

376
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:20,030
powershell there's a percentage i think

377
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:22,990
in there anyway it's all over the place

378
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:26,119
it's easily downloaded from the mitre

379
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:29,420
software you can run it and test your

380
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,870
your security products organizing your

381
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:36,080
testing this has always been a challenge

382
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:39,189
for for when I sit down and everyone

383
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,279
says well how do I test what should I do

384
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,630
it's limitless like there's so many

385
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,940
different things and we talk about

386
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,730
security and depth and yes security and

387
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,460
death is very important and how you

388
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:54,490
approach that need some organization so

389
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,559
I like to saber kill chain from Lockheed

390
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,169
and the reason I like it is because we

391
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,230
can start to look at the types of things

392
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:06,039
that happen the types of tools products

393
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,260
I can deploy in depth and based on this

394
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:11,470
information I can start to line up

395
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,289
testing matrixes right things that I can

396
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,960
do and everyone knows that you want to

397
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,669
try to find it and prevent it and as we

398
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,399
talked about it's not a hundred percent

399
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:23,440
so looking inside looking at lateral

400
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:27,219
movement this is an area I've really

401
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,860
been pushing people it's like visibility

402
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,720
or the machine learning micro

403
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,668
segmentation technologies these are

404
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,039
things that we need to do and the reason

405
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:38,139
we do it is because today once it goes

406
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:39,850
beyond your perimeter everyone can talk

407
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:41,469
to everyone there's nothing being

408
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,870
inspected and this is why they'll sit

409
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:48,279
there and live in your network for four

410
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:50,110
months all right so just like I was

411
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,809
describing you can identify these

412
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,240
different tools and once you find in

413
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:57,820
action firewalls weakness you can then

414
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,389
look at different tools alone to the

415
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:04,559
kill chain different places in point

416
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:07,090
test your endpoint mitre framework is

417
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,799
actually very endpoint oriented right

418
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,110
now we are transits we're networking

419
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,200
company we're trying to help them do

420
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:18,010
that so we're going back to this

421
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,710
original chart that has the things that

422
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,240
you can do frequency vulnerability

423
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,580
assessment these things are automated

424
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,909
and then the human based pin test red

425
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,289
teams and the new emerging technologies

426
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:31,720
coming out from breach and attack

427
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:33,820
simulation there's a lot of open source

428
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,870
options out there things that gets you

429
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,970
started this is the thing that we need

430
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,459
right something that will help us test

431
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:48,639
help us measure help us continuously

432
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:50,610
improve our network the solution needs

433
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:53,010
to make sure that your

434
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:56,100
following the tactic techniques the

435
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:58,440
TTP's that it's safe right we want to be

436
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,689
safe it's our production Network this is

437
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,970
one of the things that I continuously

438
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,590
run into as I start to talk about

439
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,590
testing your network and testing

440
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,230
production because they say what about

441
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,689
malware and I said well don't you get

442
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,460
malware sent to you and from people

443
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,880
trying to compromise your network and

444
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,200
the answer is yes and I said well then

445
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,760
wouldn't you want to send malware

446
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,910
through your network and they're like no

447
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,830
I don't okay you got to get over this

448
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,270
right you got to be able to safely see

449
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,189
me like you know send the malware

450
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,379
because malware you don't want to

451
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,570
detonate it but you want to determine

452
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,480
did my sandboxing technology actually

453
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:39,540
detect it right did my next-gen firewall

454
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,880
detect it did my endpoint detected

455
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:46,770
you know don't detonate it that's not a

456
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,600
good idea but the follow itself yes and

457
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:51,030
then of course we all know that many

458
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,990
malware these days the first pack

459
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:56,850
payload will not be harmful so go back

460
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,300
into those labs get yourself something

461
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:05,820
that you can do continuing into how you

462
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:08,550
would test and measure the the using the

463
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,649
cyber kill chain you can apply

464
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:12,500
techniques to help you test and I

465
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,180
started talking about malware

466
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,340
polymorphism the things that they do how

467
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:20,070
they get transferred the tunnel they get

468
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,750
tunneled they get obfuscated there there

469
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:25,560
might be some simple encryption it might

470
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:29,000
be complex encryption there may be lots

471
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,950
of things they try to do to evade it's

472
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,230
important to know how effective though

473
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,990
is your security controls that detecting

474
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,540
such things each one of these would

475
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:42,030
require different technologies botnets

476
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,350
command and control these are things

477
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,720
that are going to happen the first thing

478
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,280
as soon as the malware detonates it's

479
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,930
going to talk to his command and control

480
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,530
right so how good is your threat

481
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:54,900
intelligence how good are your or your

482
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:57,660
your set intelligence your some guys

483
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,330
your people who are monitoring are they

484
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,450
going to see some kind of an alert

485
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:04,490
notification that told them hey this

486
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,110
user downloaded something the next thing

487
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,360
that happened is that that system talked

488
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,659
to a known botnet command and control

489
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:15,649
system right that's that's something you

490
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:18,520
can test you don't have to let them hack

491
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,690
you right you can you can test it by

492
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,879
getting your threat intelligence and

493
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,550
just connecting using something that

494
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,350
would connect to one of those IPs

495
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:32,780
just pinging it or something like that

496
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:34,580
right so we need it to be continuous

497
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,889
right we need to make sure that what

498
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:40,399
we're doing is continuous that we can

499
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:42,530
run it over and over and over every time

500
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,660
we have new results from our test as we

501
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:48,620
build up our our different testing

502
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,450
mechanisms that go through each of our

503
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,459
security it's going to help us

504
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,380
understand you know where I need to

505
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,000
improve maybe where I can invest

506
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,230
I might have to rip and replace some

507
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,180
things but once you get to a place where

508
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,390
you're maybe you're not happy but at

509
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,160
least you are comfortable with it keep

510
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,620
that comfort level make sure that it's

511
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:14,780
continuously happening by running

512
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:18,199
everyday things that are important for

513
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,330
threat hunters be able to do things like

514
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,950
the Equifax your want to cry right these

515
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,870
things come out they happen

516
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,820
hope you know they happen to others if

517
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,949
you can learn about what they did and

518
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,409
you can use this in the breach and

519
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:34,070
attack simulation products can help you

520
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:36,440
to simulate those type of events safely

521
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:39,290
in your network and let you know what

522
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,960
would happen so your seaso comes and

523
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:44,210
says hey I heard about this equifax what

524
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,390
would happen to us right you can give

525
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,740
them an answer and of course because we

526
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,510
don't have labs and we're always looking

527
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,150
at new technologies like machine

528
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,730
learning which is really hard to test

529
00:23:53,150 --> 00:24:00,230
right secret sauce of of machine

530
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:01,520
learning I have seen some success from

531
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,340
some of the machine learning products

532
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,350
out there you know they're getting

533
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,909
better and better we need things that

534
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,790
help us test them right so our

535
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,999
production network is there if you can

536
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,529
simulate things as bad actor

537
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:20,289
hopefully the machine-learning pulls

538
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:24,279
that out your people processes and tools

539
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:27,369
alright the most valuable thing we have

540
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:29,859
today the people right so what we can do

541
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:31,839
with our own self hacking Red Team

542
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:34,688
exercise briefs and in fact simulation

543
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,428
has to help our teams improve so I

544
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:40,749
mentioned the security information event

545
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:44,859
manager threat hunter or somebody that's

546
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:46,689
monitoring the system you will find out

547
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:50,049
stuff you'll learn stuff right you'll

548
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:51,879
you'll be able to determine hey or does

549
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:56,918
my team recognize the right kind of

550
00:24:51,879 --> 00:24:59,438
events when they come through and so

551
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,449
going back real quick to summarize some

552
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:03,309
of these things that you wanted to get

553
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:06,239
from it is that it has to be safe

554
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:09,969
it has to be realistic right use

555
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:12,009
unfortunately malware is is just be

556
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:14,469
careful it has to be safe right a

557
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:17,409
repeatable measurable continues like

558
00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:20,169
human exercises tend not to be the same

559
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:22,179
all right repeat it but the beauty of a

560
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:27,339
human is that we have good intuition

561
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:28,989
we're able to actually think a little

562
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:31,948
more crazier than the computers will

563
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:35,109
write in to enter and continuous

564
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:38,319
continuous being the key word right the

565
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:40,509
we have to get to a point to find any

566
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,729
kind of change or any issues with their

567
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:44,919
systems as soon as they happen these

568
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:46,659
these things that go on for a month and

569
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:51,329
we're not aware of it or are leaving big

570
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:51,329
doors open for for cyber criminals

571
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:57,489
getting us to that point best thing we

572
00:25:54,819 --> 00:26:04,049
can have is an optimizing security right

573
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:04,049
measured and optimized thank you

574
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:11,709
[Applause]

575
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:16,260
Thank You seed we have time for

576
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,260
questions so yes let's start here

577
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:29,830
what again security software it's better

578
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:33,190
for ultimate automatic security what the

579
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,929
question is what security products are

580
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:40,030
better Robert's products are better

581
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:42,520
first automating security yes ok I have

582
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:45,190
to stay away from recommending products

583
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,960
to people so that's one of the reasons I

584
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:52,990
definitely say that you need to test but

585
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,470
the the as far as what can you do to

586
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,850
remediate there's sword technologies

587
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,100
orchestration automation response

588
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:03,070
technologies coming out these are the

589
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,560
things that are being put in front of

590
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,600
you to help you once you find something

591
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,850
going on to try and quarantine it

592
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,800
quickly help your Incident Response Team

593
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,510
respond to it so I'd be looking at soar

594
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,629
anything that's going to help you

595
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:18,310
identify machine learning what you

596
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,650
finding your machine learning tie it to

597
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:24,070
your automation orchestration products

598
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:26,760
to to to to security network that's the

599
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:28,720
product you need to be looking at

600
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,150
awesome let's take the next question

601
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,470
here please keep your hand raised so we

602
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:37,620
can see thank you for the presentation

603
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:41,950
how do you justify the value of security

604
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:45,389
in your work like can give some examples

605
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,390
how do you approach it

606
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:55,399
the other side should be just a goatee

607
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,750
know how to justify the value of

608
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:01,880
security artists all that is exactly

609
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,890
okay how do you justify the security

610
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,540
spend right exactly yeah

611
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,980
so that's that's the huge question

612
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,710
that's the big question that we're

613
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,200
trying to answer as I go around talking

614
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:14,810
I still today blows my mind one of the

615
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,640
guys goes you know how do I justify that

616
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:29,800
I want to secure something and I'm like

617
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:33,380
okay nobody's after us and it's really

618
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:36,770
the thing we have to do is use proof

619
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:39,800
such as maybe testing the show where we

620
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,660
have weaknesses you know and then take

621
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,730
that and turn it into a dollar sign to

622
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,460
the boss right the management's gonna

623
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,470
say you know this these are things that

624
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,180
are going to impact us our business and

625
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,550
they'll say well but they're not after

626
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,380
us right so we got to get proof we got

627
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:56,240
to show things that are coming in so we

628
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:00,950
got to find them it's a that's the

629
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:04,700
everything because there's one point

630
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:08,230
here a lot of people speak about data so

631
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,230
numbers of date which are

632
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:12,720
dad but they don't speak about the now

633
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:16,019
mercy security so financial loss

634
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:21,509
insecurity it's not always on the top

635
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:26,909
part yeah it is today's your data your

636
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:31,080
information and there are reports by it

637
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:33,059
shows the dollar per record lost right

638
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,009
if you're taking so if you're

639
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:37,619
maintaining customer information that

640
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:40,529
gets leaked you can go point to your

641
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:41,668
boss about how companies like Marriott

642
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:44,039
cost a lot of money

643
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:47,490
Equifax how much money it cost them yeah

644
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:49,230
okay yeah yeah these cases like that and

645
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,879
of course technology companies what's

646
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,139
the you know what's the most important

647
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:54,928
thing you would think their intellectual

648
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:56,879
property right so you know losing the

649
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:58,379
intellectual property may cause you to

650
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:01,080
cost your company in the fact that you

651
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,759
lose the ability to compete you your how

652
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,710
you're doing things so that you lose

653
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,960
control over it right and that's gonna

654
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,149
cost the the company these are these are

655
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:14,100
really hard problems for all of us I

656
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:18,928
know and reports like that support

657
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:26,639
thanks very much that next question over

658
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:28,499
here please keep your hand raised thank

659
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:32,248
you for the presentation you talked

660
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:35,009
about automatic cyberattacks so like so

661
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:37,710
Tech is like DARPA funded project so in

662
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:43,679
hands of US government it makes sense

663
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:45,960
but in wrong hands so what about

664
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,360
automated cyber defenses because they

665
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,970
are the period of the time yes that's

666
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,008
yes that this is my this is the point I

667
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,110
mean the fact is Metasploit out there

668
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:57,149
the attacks are out there they exploit

669
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,070
that that becomes public right they can

670
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:01,320
use it against people the ability to

671
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,658
defend against these things is what we

672
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,480
need to do continuously and then how can

673
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:09,029
we protect against them right in a

674
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,090
automatic fashion we're not there yet

675
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:14,429
but in order to get there we have to

676
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:17,428
have the means of automating the things

677
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:19,610
that help us determine where the issues

678
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:21,260
are what how effective it

679
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:24,139
knocking web browser attacks and my

680
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,700
which ones are getting through based on

681
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,070
the ones getting through I can make

682
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:32,360
decisions do I allow that browser in my

683
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:36,290
network right do I add endpoint security

684
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:38,799
do I add threat intelligence or you know

685
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:41,178
do i patch right this is information

686
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,889
knowledge that gives you the right

687
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:45,530
information in the right informant to

688
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:47,270
make informed decisions so we need to

689
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,460
get to a point to where we can get that

690
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:52,879
information and then automate the

691
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,740
processes to install and and add you

692
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,330
know capabilities to remediate and

693
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,220
mitigate problems

694
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:02,870
we're not there where we're automating

695
00:31:58,220 --> 00:33:09,080
those things yet but that's the come

696
00:32:02,870 --> 00:33:11,479
back and we have two primary vectors

697
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:15,320
that we're getting hit or users and web

698
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:17,030
applications right so I mean there's a

699
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,070
lot of other vectors but those are

700
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,110
really important vectors to try to

701
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,939
protect against and figure out and web

702
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:27,770
application firewalls are very complex

703
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:29,450
piece testing them is is a lot of work

704
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,540
right so there's a lot of ways you can

705
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,070
do it these type of tools and

706
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,050
talking about or focusing on web

707
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:38,570
application firewalls so they'll bring

708
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:42,050
you cross-site scripting attacks sequel

709
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:44,090
injection try to determine don't use

710
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:46,040
just exploits right because that usually

711
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,780
means you're looking for a signature

712
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,940
it's more of a technique that's

713
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,550
important so sequel injection a

714
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,500
wordpress sequel injection vulnerability

715
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,379
is a one-time event against wordpress

716
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,630
sequel injection as a technique in how

717
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,030
it happens that's more important that

718
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:04,130
you can cover for your web application

719
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:06,050
firewall is how effective it is in that

720
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,610
and then once you get that information

721
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:10,370
you can compare the vendors and where

722
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:13,069
you're at and how effective it is you

723
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:15,139
can start to try to change the coding

724
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,270
habits or things like that right product

725
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:20,929
security is going to become really

726
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:23,360
critical there - thank you so much Steve

727
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:26,269
once again

728
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,269
[Applause]
