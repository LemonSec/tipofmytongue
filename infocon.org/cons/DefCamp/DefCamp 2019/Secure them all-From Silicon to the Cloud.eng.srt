1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
our next speaker is also a very special

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,420
one and he's come to deaf camp all the

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,639
way from China and we had the chance to

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,340
interview him for the Deaf camp blog so

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,100
when we asked why he comes to

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,529
conferences like these he told us this

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,900
it matters to me because the hacker

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,850
community is quite unique as hackers

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,609
around the world are somewhat connected

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,980
like family so meeting with family

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,960
members is important so I would really

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,809
really enjoy discuss for us it's like

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,140
hacker Christmas to have deaf camp each

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,899
November so Julie our next speaker is a

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,000
senior security researcher at 360

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,390
unicorn team of security Research

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,870
Institute and he's author and co-author

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,860
of multiple security books his research

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,300
focus is includes connected cars

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,000
wireless communication hardware security

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,910
and many many other topics he's

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,870
presented this research at conferences

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:07,710
like blackhat Def Con H ITB and now at

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,380
Def Jam he's also the trainer in the ISC

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,720
and co-founder of the first Def Con

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,350
group in China

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:19,170
0:10 in Beijing so in his talk he'll go

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,908
through those attack vectors that he's

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,130
been studying for such a long time and

30
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,380
he'll share plenty of real-world

31
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:42,000
examples with us so please join me in

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:43,908
welcoming Julie to the stage okay thank

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,610
you for the warm welcome

34
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:51,689
actually before I came here I plan to my

35
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,820
talk to and I cover all the gaps that

36
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,199
the security community has been facing

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,869
for asthma in my opinion because like

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,049
when I do I was doing a car research car

39
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,250
security research I found out that the

40
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:10,070
R&D department had

41
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,680
when Pam and automobile manufacturers

42
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:15,560
they're like don't pay much attention

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,800
about security and the security

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,490
community there is there a significant

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,770
gap to understand how automotive like

46
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,030
works like the house can pass how they

47
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:31,160
like different ECU works so after I

48
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:35,420
realized that quiz the problem I

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,420
actually wrote a book about it so first

50
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,450
let me introduce myself as the house

51
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:48,380
pollsters already introduced and a

52
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:49,940
member of eunuch unicorn team at 360 360

53
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,070
is a Chinese security company we have

54
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,640
like antivirus and other security

55
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,500
solutions so I'm also the I'll also

56
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,769
started the DEF CON group overall which

57
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,230
is the hacker community in Beijing based

58
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,900
so that's how I actually made some

59
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,049
people from Romania and that's how I'm

60
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,920
here so I am glad to find out that only

61
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,780
Asian face here so it's kind of feel

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,480
obliged to introduce you guys to the

63
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,489
Chinese hacker community and also the

64
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,929
Chinese Internet is security industry as

65
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:26,810
a whole so so the I have been AG persons

66
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:30,170
are actually my team members and me have

67
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:33,049
prison at those conferences as well so

68
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,640
this are the books I worry about so

69
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:37,970
first one is the book and mentioned

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,910
about Connecticut car security it's in

71
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,570
this book I hope to bridge the gap

72
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,609
between the two community the automobile

73
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,700
R&D community and the security community

74
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:54,440
so a lot of like real-world examples out

75
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:57,500
of car hacking stuff so the second one

76
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,280
is Wireless which one which one I would

77
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,459
like to show you a many demo videos

78
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,620
videos up about and the third one is a

79
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:11,390
translation in English it's often me

80
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:13,760
middle one so it's like way for the

81
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,459
first pastor like five years we have

82
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,769
been doing like wireless security car

83
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,399
security and hardware security a lot so

84
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:24,180
this one is

85
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:27,109
we got recognized by Tesla and we found

86
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,820
this like wireless protocol

87
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,669
vulnerability of Tesla and there is some

88
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,990
interim and the next thank has on their

89
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:38,490
website so it's like this one is for

90
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,850
signal an Iraqi security it's like we

91
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:45,240
found this 4G network done great attack

92
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:48,030
so we submit to the state and VD which

93
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,610
is managing the standard for senior

94
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,530
networks so the number one submission

95
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:58,380
after back one tip program so so what

96
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,359
can you get when you actually pull off

97
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,460
certain attack against certain company

98
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,410
so you get invited to your party to meet

99
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:10,590
your role model so so when this start

100
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:13,680
our main contents so what I'm going to

101
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:17,070
talk about is like from the silicon to

102
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,050
the cloud so because when you're doing

103
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,479
hardware research you know that if you

104
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,930
want a tree achieve the automated

105
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:28,229
security you have to be implemented in

106
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,350
hardware like storing the key or

107
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:35,310
algorithm inside the security secur

108
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:39,479
processor like in clave or untrusted on

109
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:42,810
something like that but is that secure

110
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:46,409
enough or later find out because I'm not

111
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:49,320
the expert at this but my friends are so

112
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,800
I will tell you how like how the next

113
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,770
security processor like a silicon chip

114
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,770
can be cracked or reverse engineered

115
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,620
then I will talk about the communication

116
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:04,950
to communication I'm referring to like a

117
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,810
pipe you just transfer data show the

118
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,389
pipe to the cloud to the other device to

119
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,160
the other loads on the network the

120
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:14,780
communication protocol can be like blue

121
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,729
to be similar and other natural

122
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,580
communication protocol so finally this

123
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:23,280
cloud and server Security's like I think

124
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,800
this is why we're all the conference

125
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,559
talked up a lot many people are talking

126
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,260
about this cloud security banking

127
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,979
security Nike and nakir sacred circle

128
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,150
injections

129
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,240
that's

130
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:42,060
we'll be classified in a certain

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:45,510
category so starting from the silicon se

132
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,880
is it kind of the whole Nancy landscape

133
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:52,170
security landscape we are facing so you

134
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,570
have this this isn't like cheap or SOC

135
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,670
so inside it it you have the different

136
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:00,030
module like crypto module you have this

137
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:04,140
like graphic processing module something

138
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:08,460
like that so then you should wear this

139
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:10,770
chip and circuit board so the sector but

140
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,770
there are other like attack vectors like

141
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,180
the different chips that communicating

142
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,760
with each other using a serial

143
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,730
communication or like pass this or

144
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,510
something like that so that's another

145
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:26,550
that's are there like attack vectors so

146
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:29,430
and then like you have this module so

147
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,060
one module can contain multiple security

148
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,220
circuit boards so the modules can

149
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,220
introduce another can have attack so

150
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,770
then you come you come up with the sec

151
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,190
nodes I mean by loads I'm referring to

152
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,469
devices it can be a IOT device it can be

153
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,350
a computer you can be a server something

154
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,690
so then it's a whole cyberspace you'll

155
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,210
connect to those nodes to the Internet

156
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:58,290
you are like facing attacks from all

157
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,370
over the world so starting from the

158
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,490
silicon level

159
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:06,090
so actually security people like they're

160
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,490
always trying to find the shortest short

161
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,770
card for hacking scenes but if they

162
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,520
can't they will go to the extreme like

163
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:17,909
this one the capture chips are usually

164
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,510
for me like when I do security testing I

165
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,790
usually don't go this far but for some

166
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,250
like of my friends they won't really

167
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,960
want to act you they have the crack or

168
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,440
hack something I will go to extreme

169
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,718
access and this is going to require

170
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:39,599
high-end equipments like the high in the

171
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:43,020
microscope and also the chemical

172
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,840
procedure to actually captures chip and

173
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,949
using the photo techniques

174
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,860
- and then some automatic software to

175
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,900
process the image you've taken from this

176
00:08:52,860 --> 00:09:01,320
silicon and then reverse-engineer the

177
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:04,290
case level netlist so so if anybody had

178
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,880
any embedded research development the

179
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,310
the vendor will always tell you if you

180
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,410
want to protect your firm or from being

181
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,920
dumped you should like burn the Evo or

182
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:16,439
something but is that enough people are

183
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,599
doing this they're using like micro

184
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,490
probes to actually to connect the

185
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,180
connection inside the chip and dump the

186
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,890
frame or something like that so they are

187
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,459
also using this technology like a

188
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:35,640
focused in beam to actually editing the

189
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,960
silicon after the decathlete ticket so

190
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,460
they can make connection between like

191
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,660
like the Evo snow

192
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:50,780
devious pads or something like that and

193
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:55,079
also like cut or I didn't this technique

194
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,490
initially the users want to like - maybe

195
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,710
when the design chips

196
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,700
there are minor mistakes we made they

197
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:05,460
were use this kind of techniques to

198
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:08,540
rectify what the mistakes but they are

199
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:12,420
also misused to crack crack stock

200
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:16,949
cracking like chips or to reverse

201
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:19,189
engineer so also the I used like - for

202
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,390
copyright copyright copyright

203
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,930
verification for example you filled out

204
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:27,020
somebody stealing your IP to produce

205
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:32,550
chips you can use this to actually

206
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:36,480
reverse engineer their tips so this is

207
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,000
how a hot and how the city can look like

208
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,850
when you're actually using microscope to

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,070
take new pictures and you stitch the

210
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,959
pictures together and then use a

211
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:51,060
software to extract the late list and

212
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,060
then you can do analysis this is kind of

213
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,849
very very small chip only have a few

214
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,890
pins but you can see it's inside that

215
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,550
it's it's come see company

216
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:04,949
in laughs so you'd have to use some

217
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,530
automatic process to to deal with this

218
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:16,200
because minions of Kate use certain

219
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:17,910
ships so this is like security people

220
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,280
are dealing you know what else is there

221
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,520
security coming me community is the only

222
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:26,870
ways like most people are doing this

223
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,920
application security but but like

224
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,230
professional bug hunters they are doing

225
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,150
a quiz operating they're trying to find

226
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,240
operating system they are trying to find

227
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,930
like old days for old days or something

228
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:43,110
that like that also they have this like

229
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:45,300
micro architecture level research it's

230
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,930
like just like the interest chip

231
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,180
security for last year they are like at

232
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,609
this level but what why I have just

233
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:59,099
mention is like it's a even lower level

234
00:11:53,610 --> 00:12:04,130
at they are dealing with this okay now

235
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,510
the only ways that's like gate level so

236
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,060
like a lot of people are talking about

237
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,540
like like quantum computing or something

238
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,060
like that I think it's like this is the

239
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,390
lowest level under there

240
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:21,150
like I met but I mean quantum computer

241
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:23,580
may prosper threat in the future but

242
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:29,699
this is like what actually happening a

243
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:32,940
lot no like so so how to attack the

244
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,670
silicon and except for apart from this

245
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,280
microbe approach you can also use other

246
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,740
attack methods like the for the

247
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,319
injection an epic example of this one

248
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:47,570
it's like very hilarious example would

249
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,570
be this one let me show you

250
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,209
[Music]

251
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:03,930
this video has been rotated somehow I

252
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:07,650
don't know why actually so we know we

253
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:10,739
use smart locks a lot but when they

254
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,470
design this smart lock they didn't use

255
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,470
like Gaussian cage or anything to block

256
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:20,820
the interference from outside the door

257
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:24,780
so you use like Tesla coils I'm seeing

258
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:28,620
and to omit the image from my magnetic

259
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,870
poles and then causing this failure on

260
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,940
the circuit board may be causing the

261
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,210
because you're inducing current or

262
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,100
voltage and uncertain traces of the the

263
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,830
circuit board so it will cause this

264
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,410
circuit board to reboot or may be

265
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:47,250
causing some interrupts to trigger and

266
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:50,130
then the the the the smalltalk will

267
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,770
automatically unlock so that's kind of a

268
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:56,330
classic example of 40 injection but

269
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,319
that's not the only one recently I think

270
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:02,010
you may have heard the news that

271
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:06,660
somebody used laser to like I activate

272
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:09,780
the voice count controlled speakers like

273
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,910
the Amazon Alex are some something like

274
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:16,319
that so there are using later to

275
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:18,360
activate those but most electromagnetic

276
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,010
pulse are the most commonly used and

277
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,200
also powered leads so so this is how you

278
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,880
inject the thought inside the chip

279
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:34,410
because you cannot see what's running

280
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:37,290
there so let me show you so we just

281
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:40,319
introduce the iv injection for injection

282
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:43,349
as I shall I think I should go more

283
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,230
detail because many people are using

284
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:49,110
this a lot because when you do certain

285
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:52,020
like for example if you are doing

286
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,930
certain research and there there's like

287
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,000
your cat stack you know you know in the

288
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,670
hardware actually because there's

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,320
certain computation and like are done in

290
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,270
inside the hardware you have not you can

291
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,130
do nothing about it so you can use a

292
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,370
power glitch or something to introduce

293
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,829
thought may like like like causing a

294
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,350
program to

295
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:14,839
to run two different brands so you can

296
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:20,089
actually dump former or something so

297
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:23,239
this is for the injection so the side

298
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,309
channel analysis is like when you it's

299
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:28,850
also like you have to be very familiar

300
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:29,149
with how the the chip works inside the

301
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,589
chip

302
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:32,540
it's like the gate level how the

303
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:35,509
transfer different states held because

304
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,269
to transfer the states at the gate level

305
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:41,319
you can you're consuming the the power

306
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:46,189
so that were like causing the power

307
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:49,309
trace to change to then you can analyze

308
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:51,559
the power trace to actually infer what's

309
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:53,959
going on inside the chip and that's

310
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:56,360
infer the key but there are lots of

311
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:59,660
algorithm and models used to do this

312
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,269
it's like but but general how how does

313
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,389
it work is like this you your sample is

314
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:11,170
how the device is consuming power using

315
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:14,480
this telescope or during this i'll see

316
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:17,839
oscilloscope to sample the power trace

317
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,660
and then you use their like specific

318
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,749
like research area of like they are come

319
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,100
up with many models many kind of

320
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:32,059
transformation to analyze this trace and

321
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:34,519
then come and infer the keys so like we

322
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:37,069
talked about the silicon level attacks

323
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:40,999
now we are going to talk about about the

324
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:43,459
unship interfaces so that's like because

325
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:46,910
we have now using have been using SOC a

326
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:50,059
lot and inside that associate like you

327
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:53,629
not only have the CPU room or ram you

328
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:56,929
also have this like different neck you

329
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:59,240
can see core processor or ASIC to

330
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:03,290
process different tasks like graphics

331
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:06,799
crypto so you have to this interface

332
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:10,970
inside this as oh say two of between the

333
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:14,480
CPU and those modules or elements or

334
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:18,520
issac one of those could be like a sec

335
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,189
to run back to in their proprietary

336
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,109
crypto algorithm and store the keys or

337
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,890
something

338
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:30,820
so another example would be the AI core

339
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:34,000
processor many chips come ways like AI

340
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,559
accelerator like there you can run like

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,909
neural network or something like that

342
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:43,029
but many application are sharing that

343
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:43,899
they are sharing that ASIC that could be

344
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:47,679
curved oh yeah

345
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:49,620
so when one application time using this

346
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,510
they should there are sometimes

347
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,908
sometimes we'll have neck is what will

348
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:59,049
happen is this application can figure

349
00:17:54,909 --> 00:18:01,480
this core processors to do certain tasks

350
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:04,658
for example like the using certain like

351
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,870
machine learning model and run run run

352
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:09,940
and this core processor so what will

353
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,678
happen is that after this applicant I'm

354
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,720
using this core processor it will

355
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,309
release this resource to add replication

356
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,010
so that if if there the cleanup is in

357
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:23,860
wasn't done correctly this application

358
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:27,399
may be able to dump the model or

359
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:32,439
parameters of these applications like

360
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:35,620
priority priority model or something

361
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:41,620
like that so this is like one of the

362
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:44,590
attacks can happen inside the SSA so

363
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,860
actually it's like already we tested

364
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,539
some it's already happened that's

365
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,590
certain like photo processing

366
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:56,830
application they have this like model to

367
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:59,080
extract free share stack I like to apply

368
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,240
theaters to your photo or certain like

369
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,309
effects to your photo those are models

370
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,710
they train themselves and they cut back

371
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:12,190
you can actually track those models from

372
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:15,090
the associate so this is like how you do

373
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:20,620
analysis like this is a typical working

374
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:21,610
power analyzer they have this

375
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,989
disassembly

376
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:30,039
like Ida I don't know you can see

377
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:33,039
because this is no so this like Ida you

378
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:36,620
have this disassembly interface and this

379
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:39,500
is also since data inside

380
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,469
did you have this how - how - like

381
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,570
invoke the ASIC like a crypto Inge or

382
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:49,370
something how to interact with that

383
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:54,320
Isaac that module inside SOC and then

384
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:59,360
you have this binary you have your neck

385
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:04,850
you can capture certain ik packets from

386
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:08,830
this CPU to the crypt or like basic and

387
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,830
then you you'll have this

388
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:15,800
reverse-engineered netlist the s is like

389
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:20,450
register level the gate level schematic

390
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:24,620
then you can analyze how this module is

391
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:26,809
reacting to the CPU from the the

392
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,709
disassembly interface and you can

393
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:34,070
extract the RTL level register transfer

394
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:37,540
level algorithm because those are prior

395
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:41,830
or private or in algorithm are stored as

396
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:46,399
hardware configuration in the ASIC so

397
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:48,320
it's not like a like a ESO RS RS a

398
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,500
stored in the room or something it's

399
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,490
actually a hardware circuit so this is

400
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:58,040
how you do the chip SOC reverse engineer

401
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,950
so after the unzip interface we can like

402
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,540
talk about the communication security

403
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:06,490
that will be like the communication

404
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:12,020
between the chips or modules or devices

405
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:14,300
so this like an image from the internet

406
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,730
it's like you can see there's a

407
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,730
microcontroller country communicating

408
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,679
with different sub modules and this

409
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:25,250
device you have this like Bluetooth

410
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:28,610
module GPS module so this is how typical

411
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:30,470
LT device work actually if you have ever

412
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:35,260
done any ad you know development he

413
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:38,929
wouldn't notice so sometimes for example

414
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:42,050
if you want to get certain keys like

415
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:45,190
paired with this Pro touch or like other

416
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,000
modules they are encrypted from the

417
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,740
radio interface

418
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,890
air interface but there

419
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:56,070
in Planet X and this as well and those

420
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:59,190
like communication interface like UART

421
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:02,550
SPI something like that so you can use a

422
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:05,280
like logic analyzer to actually capture

423
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:11,190
the communication and then get the key

424
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:15,059
or something sometimes like the smart

425
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:17,190
lock they are using like a fingerprint

426
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:20,370
scanner to get to sample your

427
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,679
fingerprint image but the that

428
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,030
fingerprint module is outside the door

429
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,750
because you have to actually have to

430
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:30,210
press on it so that's how they

431
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,510
communicate with an MCU main processor

432
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:37,559
is using a serial interface so if you

433
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:40,080
are able to pull out this fingerprint

434
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:43,710
scanner you can actually sometimes it's

435
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,169
prove the fingerprint comparing result

436
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:51,840
to unlock that door that's how I

437
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:55,590
actually tested on certain locks so this

438
00:22:51,840 --> 00:23:00,090
is like during the logic analyzer I use

439
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:07,678
a lot to analyze smart devices so let me

440
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:11,070
show you some examples so for this mark

441
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,480
not case you have this like main board

442
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,340
inside the door

443
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,420
your kind of access it but there are

444
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,909
modules like keyboard like the keyboard

445
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,880
Ike fingerprint scanner like an IFC

446
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:27,780
reader to read the the the access card

447
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:31,230
and those communication interface with

448
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:34,710
the MCU it's sometimes their most most

449
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:37,350
of the time they don't encrypt it so you

450
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,600
can actually analyze any you can develop

451
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,149
and using a door or something to write

452
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,610
an embedded code to control the

453
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,309
interface to should prove this sub

454
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:53,790
module and to unlock the door or

455
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:56,460
something like that so this is a humble

456
00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:00,178
and open communication act for iPhone se

457
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:03,600
interface it's like I square C interface

458
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:07,560
it's I think most of you know me

459
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,080
or you know this so this is what I have

460
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:14,310
been talking about so this is a physical

461
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,970
boundary for like for like a smart lock

462
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:20,550
or other device like this part you

463
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:26,040
cannot access it but this part you can

464
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:28,560
so what you will do is like export to

465
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,050
use this on board application on board

466
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:35,460
communication interface to attack this

467
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:37,230
system so so this this this one's like

468
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,280
fingerprint sensors using serial

469
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,110
communication to this the two to this

470
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,260
fingerprint module so this module is

471
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:49,800
responsible like finger print image

472
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:52,800
feature extraction and comparing and

473
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,290
story so many like fingerprint is

474
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,940
thought the templates are called

475
00:24:54,290 --> 00:25:00,230
fingerprint features that are templates

476
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,880
so they stole the templates and once you

477
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,430
press your finger they will compare you

478
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,520
of the feature it extracted from this

479
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:11,250
sensor instead with the template it's

480
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,160
taught in this module so and then the

481
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:17,610
the main CPU will get a result

482
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:20,520
so how like the result would be like the

483
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,860
percentage like how like 90 percent

484
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,900
match you with its thought template so

485
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,600
there would be a stretch holding its m

486
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,570
CEO saying that if it's this red the

487
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,800
match is above like 90 percent I can

488
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,679
actually add or something

489
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,590
so this interface now because we

490
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,780
reported many more bucks to the vendors

491
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:43,110
and are now starting to encrypt this

492
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,870
part but this part is still not

493
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,939
encrypted so but it's very hard to

494
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:50,330
actually to do this because you have

495
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:55,200
this is kind of like a like a photo

496
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:57,389
there transfer a photo so you have to

497
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,630
capture refer to you you can actually

498
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:03,690
like install a backdoor device to

499
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:06,120
capture users fingerprint image and

500
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,550
replay at the scene first unlock that

501
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,580
though it's not as convenient as to

502
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:17,389
attack from this part continued access

503
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:19,520
both the comparing result so

504
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,429
so for further communication interface

505
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:26,440
what those are the tour's we developed

506
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:29,000
ourselves to actually to attack those

507
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,570
communication excesses for Ethernet this

508
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,549
is for you are this useful

509
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:38,678
protection like protect you from like

510
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:43,100
USB attack from USB interface that's

511
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:45,679
passed parrots can talk and supporting

512
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:49,969
like spi uart many kind of onboard

513
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:52,940
protocol so here we come comes with

514
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,650
comes wireless communication so for

515
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,080
wireless communication like all

516
00:26:54,650 --> 00:27:00,650
protocols are secure and until it is

517
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,678
broken so what does this means like so

518
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:07,309
like like 4G network before the burner

519
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:10,730
ability being released they think 40 are

520
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:13,460
the secure network like they're more

521
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:16,460
secure than GSM or GPRS something like

522
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,260
that but when new vulnerability came out

523
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,760
they were saying oh 4G is not secure

524
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:24,309
Nets expect 5g to be secure then 50 then

525
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,160
packages for mobility being released so

526
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:32,540
don't trust any pipe any communicate

527
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,790
protocol you just focus the device you

528
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,428
can control the server you can control

529
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:42,139
you know so the the pipe between those

530
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:45,110
like you cannot trust them so we're well

531
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:48,400
I will show you a few demos about how

532
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:50,709
you do it in different wireless

533
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,470
communication next this one is used for

534
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:56,390
really NFC likely the next a bank card I

535
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,820
will show you a demo video this one is

536
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:01,610
for protecting from against those that

537
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:05,090
one is to attract automobile on a car

538
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:07,969
cars passive keyless entry system so

539
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,639
that one is for Wi-Fi protection we can

540
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,650
actually block certain connection from

541
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,200
certain device to a certain ball router

542
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:19,090
or something this one is for Wi-Fi

543
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:23,750
pineapple used to like set up like

544
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:26,149
malicious Wi-Fi hotspot so this is USRP

545
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:30,480
for SDR stuff we use this to its proof

546
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:32,730
neck gps signal we like transfer the you

547
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,820
exact same signal like the satellites

548
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:38,210
and prove the like a phone or something

549
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,860
I'll show you a video so this is a

550
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:43,470
rubber toes towards used to capture

551
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,820
Pluto's package and then to like attack

552
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,470
Bluetooth devices

553
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:52,020
so let's starting from the carcass how

554
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:55,290
how the calculate positive clearly entry

555
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,340
system work is like you have this key in

556
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,470
your pockets

557
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,959
once you approach the car there will be

558
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:05,340
a the cars constant in transmitting is

559
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,580
like 125 kilohertz radio and you will at

560
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,470
once is key realize that video like this

561
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,189
distance to realize this will be like

562
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:17,820
within 2 meter this is how they can

563
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,540
manufacturers like intended but once

564
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,790
okay

565
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,649
once this car key realize this thing

566
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:26,909
will receive this signal using the

567
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:31,580
higher frequency X 350 and 15 megahertz

568
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:35,220
to reply to the car this that's like 2v2

569
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:37,590
a communication starts and then doing

570
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,120
all kind of a syndication and then an

571
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,510
access door automatically so you don't

572
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,159
have to pull out your car key anymore

573
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:50,690
how we attack this okay let me show you

574
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:50,690
a video oh sorry

575
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:31,809
that's always the other car it's very

576
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,019
simple and the distance can be like up

577
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:40,690
to 300 meters so it's pretty dangerous

578
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:42,970
and it's not possible so this is the you

579
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:47,950
can use an axe it's like an A & F

580
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:52,840
society i rfid tag this is the Extra

581
00:30:47,950 --> 00:31:01,769
Edition cars are using still broken so

582
00:30:52,840 --> 00:31:01,769
this is for the NFC so that campaign

583
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,250
[Music]

584
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:16,340
this device is just like Apple pay haul

585
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,980
out the distance between the car and the

586
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,629
device like the decent we didn't have we

587
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:26,539
had more fun too

588
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,539
to the reader to Vice

589
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,639
[Music]

590
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,880
okay so it's her Township payment

591
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,780
this device

592
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:03,090
so success so imagine that you are like

593
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,320
flying up for somebody using a device

594
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:08,149
like a noise

595
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:14,000
[Music]

596
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:17,600
okay it's pretty useful attack so say

597
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,170
neuronal Network well use it a lot like

598
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,379
to factor our syndication like we're

599
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,380
using

600
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,859
[Music]

601
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:39,129
so because they talk is cannot carry a

602
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:44,059
lot of can come to the city

603
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:47,200
but this is if the talk we have done

604
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:47,200
if you're welcome all

605
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,989
[Music]

606
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,290
so this is like a moment cloning

607
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,290
procedure

608
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:03,030
so this right side is a victim

609
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:06,290
no I think just that

610
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:06,290
Brenner's on somebody

611
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,360
so this comes down you can sit wherever

612
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:19,879
you are not your friends trying to call

613
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,429
you again but at this time the call will

614
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,430
be hijacked by the computer

615
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,710
so let's call again

616
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,770
so you will never be able to receive

617
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,270
this call again because you have been

618
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,270
taken over by the packer

619
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:12,830
here you can see in this I meant so this

620
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,169
is like the using 4G network

621
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:20,389
but before there's a tag missing is cure

622
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:23,690
but actually when it's come let's see

623
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:28,250
the next message

624
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:30,500
so this can be used to protect them this

625
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:36,159
is actually held we were able to reset

626
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:36,159
all the SMS

627
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:39,949
people's email

628
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,429
so

629
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,429
when are something this I said show that

630
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:59,589
so we can control

631
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,589
if the victim can

632
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:09,830
so actually so we are we mentioned we

633
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,960
are going to bridge the gap between

634
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:15,920
different like group of people or

635
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,990
community this is how we do it like the

636
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,859
developers that would automatically

637
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:25,729
assume that this SMS channel is secure

638
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:27,950
this SS SMS pipe you secure we have to

639
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,040
show them it's not so it's up to them to

640
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:32,089
actually implement them more secure

641
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:36,740
two-factor authentication act Fido

642
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:38,990
device it's a USB token or something or

643
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,859
even they can use a cou course indicator

644
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:47,089
approach that would be more secure than

645
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:50,420
so like the simulator this is a another

646
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:53,480
example about how to use similar network

647
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:58,099
to a hack stuff so this is actually done

648
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:05,900
by German researchers so how much time

649
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:11,619
do I have left 10 minutes okay so this

650
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:16,240
is one of the modules on the BMW cars

651
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:20,000
and the this in the middle is attacking

652
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,250
fake base stations so it's like the car

653
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,310
is it should be normally connected to

654
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:27,140
the same network operators base station

655
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:29,750
but when it's under attack you will be

656
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:32,839
connected to this one and after connect

657
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:36,020
to this one is what necrosis recommends

658
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:38,599
to the servers like because the command

659
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:40,670
was set up by the user using application

660
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:44,030
for example yet they want an exit door

661
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:46,760
you know first like request to the

662
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,770
server server would be what we get the

663
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,109
wrong command ready and we'll send a

664
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:53,869
short message to wake up the car and the

665
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:56,150
car was and as usual HTTP request to

666
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:58,369
request the command from the server and

667
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:01,160
it executed a command I can lock the

668
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:04,490
door or something so what the problem is

669
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:11,598
that this they are storing the the keys

670
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:13,609
in this like GM GSM modern so if you're

671
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,720
using the space station to capture the

672
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:20,130
traffic you will say it's encrypt

673
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:23,069
but you reverse engineer this module the

674
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:25,380
key encryption key is inside it so

675
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:28,680
that's why I talked about the chip

676
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:31,380
reverse engineering from the beginning

677
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:35,040
so you subtract the encryption key from

678
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:37,050
here and now you can like like you have

679
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,300
the key you can't prove this server you

680
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,130
will direct this traffic to your

681
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,400
attacker server let me show you

682
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:46,500
so actually I have already said that's

683
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,060
how that's how they're attractive the

684
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:55,260
keys so the keys are so we can speak

685
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:57,570
skip this actually so okay so have this

686
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:01,190
like kind of different kind of

687
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:04,619
encryption or message integrity check

688
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,220
check algorithm and different kind of

689
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:11,010
keys

690
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:14,160
so one how the attack how to do I do the

691
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:17,250
attack like the the the the spec page

692
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,609
station will send it like the wake-up

693
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:23,400
SMS message to the car so the glands in

694
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:24,839
the car will request command from the

695
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,330
server button the server now is

696
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:29,640
impersonated by the attacker because the

697
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,890
attacker got the key from the hardware

698
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,670
so it will be able to talk to this

699
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:40,710
country should fake comments now we

700
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:43,080
think immense so it's pretty like pretty

701
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:45,720
straightforward to demonstrate the idea

702
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,020
I'm trying to convey is that if you want

703
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,629
your system to be secure it has been

704
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,520
cooperation between a different size

705
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,740
group different set for example the

706
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,890
server security guy and the hardware

707
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,020
security guy so how to do this if you

708
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:04,440
want to security is pretty simple right

709
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:06,869
you can just use a certificate and under

710
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,420
the ocean a better key management scheme

711
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:12,450
like use a different key for different

712
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,790
car verify the server certificate so you

713
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,319
are not a big you cannot get it a

714
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:19,109
private key you will not be able to

715
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,570
spoof the server some Sun can seen Excel

716
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:25,500
but this has to be done like

717
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:28,099
coordinately with with with different

718
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,099
party

719
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:37,350
so how so because I just mentioned like

720
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,910
security many people as this conference

721
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,400
have been talking about that cloud

722
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:44,670
security whereby security I like or even

723
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,950
like cooperating network secure so they

724
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:50,130
secure the club college security I'm not

725
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:53,060
going to talk about it much

726
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:57,540
so the secure elements in the seals like

727
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:59,009
just like like that can i this this is

728
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:04,860
kind of a basic security security

729
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:07,800
measure usually implement and so mainly

730
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:10,620
attacks in pertaining to this for more

731
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,320
like upgrade or like former replacement

732
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:16,589
attack like you using update the

733
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,930
interface to to download the firmware to

734
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:22,950
certain device if the device is not

735
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:26,129
verifying verifying the the signature or

736
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:29,759
of their former if it could execute the

737
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,850
malicious for more home so virtuous

738
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,950
indications on manic electronic control

739
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:37,500
unit is like in the car case the

740
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:40,529
automobile scenario the different the

741
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,110
ECU's cannot be trusted because they're

742
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:45,690
like maybe attacked like the commodity

743
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:48,270
media modules are on the canvas so if

744
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:51,360
you that module get compromised you give

745
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:53,490
us a message to our you see on the

746
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,890
network so you should be too much

747
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:58,290
authentication even between so this is

748
00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:00,720
just for the automobile scenarios but

749
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:04,170
even on the circuit board different

750
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,839
module different chips should be mutual

751
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,000
syndication just like the next like the

752
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,670
smart lock the fingerprint scanner

753
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,340
should a syndication with the MCU you

754
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:16,620
should share like to use in a custom a

755
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:23,580
symmetric encryption to essentially each

756
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:25,890
other so for the like like forth so this

757
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:30,779
is like another example like how you'll

758
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:32,279
deal with it's like gap because many

759
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,290
people would think that we have

760
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,390
implemented authentication and

761
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:42,299
encryption in in the car key and

762
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:45,538
and like the automobile that will be

763
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:48,930
secure but this like this kind of relay

764
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:50,970
attack they did the one most likely that

765
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:54,118
didn't realize it because that they

766
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:56,160
think it's it's impossible to like to do

767
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:00,450
this like because radio you know it's

768
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,868
very fast so they're just like I okay I

769
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:06,839
have to introduce another parameter to

770
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:11,279
to actually get this clear like when you

771
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:15,029
do the calculate a k-- i said that we

772
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:17,849
can achieve up to 300 meters the reason

773
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:20,369
we can only achieve that like distance

774
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:22,799
and we did try like using 40 network or

775
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:25,470
using using Wi-Fi or something to get

776
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:27,809
get even longer distance but you were

777
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:31,558
introduced additional latency or delay

778
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:34,799
so the when they develop this system

779
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:37,740
they made that delay that kind of can be

780
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:39,869
very large so we can use like really

781
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:43,430
like up to 300 meters but not not not

782
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:47,549
enough for a 4G network to relate the

783
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:49,828
authentication packets so so how you

784
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:51,900
deal with this kind of gap is like you

785
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:54,720
have this security team you have to do

786
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:57,599
you have to talk with like like radios

787
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,700
to rate radio development team to say is

788
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,450
it possible like a physically possible

789
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:09,140
to relay the signal to attack the this

790
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:11,460
system so this is a paper that actually

791
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:15,420
addressed the problem the problem of

792
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:18,240
like video distance Bundy like so they

793
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:21,269
are like measure in the time of fly time

794
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,839
of flight of the radio signal so they

795
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:27,299
used to like before this they didn't use

796
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,250
this kind of method it will be like

797
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:32,069
physically possible to read the signal

798
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:34,769
but if you are did they are using this

799
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:38,220
one like using time of flight time of

800
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:41,700
fly to measure the distance next that's

801
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:43,950
how like the the radio is traveling at

802
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,808
the speed of light right so they're just

803
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:48,299
measuring the time difference between

804
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:50,819
the signal get transmitted and received

805
00:43:48,299 --> 00:43:53,460
so that's the like a physical limitation

806
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:58,140
you cannot drill broke

807
00:43:53,460 --> 00:44:02,039
so that's to prevent that kind of a

808
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:07,019
relay attack so the communication is to

809
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:12,809
security waste you're doing this talking

810
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:17,220
about this pipe security like you have

811
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:19,740
to like from apart from the security you

812
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:22,859
cannot prove the message you cannot

813
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:25,740
replay the message you have to concern

814
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:28,470
with the privacy so this is a like

815
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:31,288
scenario in in automobile where the

816
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:34,078
there are all syndicate each each others

817
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:36,240
like like safety messages like this

818
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,700
security credential management server

819
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,250
the managing is certificated for the

820
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:44,519
cars so the cars cannot kind of sink in

821
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:46,710
each other for to see likes figure them

822
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:49,019
what the car will transmit I'm traveling

823
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:51,839
at a certain direction for a certain

824
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:54,359
speed and the the car receive you can

825
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,569
verify but the problem is that they can

826
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:02,069
track you next for example like the

827
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:04,440
Nexus S s like SSL security you have

828
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:06,930
this server hello and hello you have to

829
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,180
exchange the credential like certificate

830
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:11,519
in that process people actually can get

831
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,990
the credential so they can that's how

832
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,848
they can track you but in their like

833
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:20,669
mobile phone or the neck like computer

834
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:24,630
scenario that's not a very very serious

835
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:27,150
problem but for the current scenario if

836
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:29,369
you can't track it can be like this is

837
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,190
kind of very sensitive primary privacy

838
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:35,579
information so apart from that you have

839
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:38,759
to so the security team have to work

840
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:40,829
with the privacy team to actually to

841
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:48,269
realize this problem before this code

842
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:50,910
goes to the vendor to the user so for

843
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:52,950
the hardware actually the reason I put

844
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:55,109
this nice because recently I have found

845
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:57,930
multiple banks for a certain

846
00:45:55,109 --> 00:46:00,240
vendor and the the box is not remotely

847
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:02,279
update for so they if they want to

848
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,729
address an issue they have to issue a

849
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:08,050
recall so that's well cause like

850
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,930
substantial loss maybe even a company

851
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:12,820
they say you actually told me if you

852
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:14,799
really want us to recall a company will

853
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:19,360
actually die so just shut up and take my

854
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:21,760
money so before you actually get your

855
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,800
product to user you have to like

856
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,070
implement like you have to think about

857
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:31,120
strode thoroughly like how your product

858
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:34,600
can be hacked even like the the the the

859
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:37,589
attack vector has been is like has been

860
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:41,230
like protected using certain like making

861
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:44,440
like mechanism but is you still have to

862
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:46,090
manage in the updating face because you

863
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,910
don't know how hackers were hack your

864
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:53,830
system so remoting updatable is very

865
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:57,520
important so this is actually still

866
00:46:53,830 --> 00:47:00,940
using a car as a as an example but i was

867
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:05,860
i was talking about it's like like

868
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:07,750
routers martin lockers other device so

869
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:11,410
the communication could have been

870
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:13,800
talking about this like don't trust

871
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:17,529
anyone on the communication ii that's

872
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:21,370
the pipe only rely on what you have

873
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:26,170
absolute control over to implement your

874
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:28,900
security next SMS as a second the factor

875
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:32,320
is a a quick example for this for this

876
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:38,790
idea it's like you can't trust but you

877
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:42,040
cannot control so mmm okay so that's

878
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:45,009
basically so so classically I just want

879
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:48,070
briefly mention that the only way slide

880
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:52,830
for clouds okay so it's like this is a

881
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:55,900
demo that I bought this like GPS tracker

882
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:58,330
but I later found out it's there there

883
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,310
are not using neck basically security

884
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:02,620
security measure so I can actually use

885
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:05,200
others for people's phone number to

886
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:07,900
track them using their system it's very

887
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,029
easy so this is like in Chinese so this

888
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,130
is an occasion how much time you have

889
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:17,029
yours you are like keep stairs

890
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:19,609
stationary there and how much battery

891
00:48:17,029 --> 00:48:21,829
you have legs or something so that's up

892
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:24,909
to this cloud security that I can

893
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:29,109
security people to actually protect that

894
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:33,039
so I don't know if I had get my idea so

895
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:33,038
if you have any question please

896
00:48:42,189 --> 00:48:47,839
super insightful look at your head yeah

897
00:48:45,529 --> 00:48:50,179
it's like a native speaker so you can

898
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,449
ask question as I will be able to

899
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:56,059
understand because I have translators we

900
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:57,469
have time for questions anyway so let's

901
00:48:56,059 --> 00:49:00,380
okay go ahead sir

902
00:48:57,469 --> 00:49:03,489
hello congratulations on your

903
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:06,229
presentation it was very complete and

904
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:08,329
the attack that caught my attention the

905
00:49:06,229 --> 00:49:10,428
most might not be one of the most

906
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:14,359
complicated ones I am speaking about

907
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:19,189
relaying and because we cannot crack the

908
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:21,949
their crypto and suppose I buy myself

909
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:25,129
that model of car yeah I do not receive

910
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:29,089
updates what would be the solution to

911
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:31,309
mitigate such a theft you have to stop

912
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:33,859
using that feature by putting your case

913
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:38,299
inside the calcium Gaussian cage or

914
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:42,380
something yes that's the only way you

915
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:45,249
can prevent this kind of attack and as I

916
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:48,079
understood the research paper aims at

917
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:50,538
repairing exactly that thing but it's

918
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,519
not the problem is because in the last

919
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:55,459
place I managed a remote an outlet the

920
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:57,919
system you have to keep that capability

921
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:59,689
to remote it out there if you can remote

922
00:49:57,919 --> 00:50:01,788
it updates the farmer are all back

923
00:49:59,689 --> 00:50:04,239
something in in the car key you can

924
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:07,130
actually address the problem by replace

925
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:11,029
original like distance measuring by

926
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:14,569
using like radio screens to like

927
00:50:11,029 --> 00:50:17,119
measuring the time of flight so you can

928
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:21,759
mitigate the problem is probably that

929
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:25,039
you cannot remove you do that thank you

930
00:50:21,759 --> 00:50:26,689
awesome next question don't forget we

931
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:29,900
have hats for you I know that people

932
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:32,078
crave them usually please keep your hand

933
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,079
up

934
00:50:36,009 --> 00:50:41,150
hi thanks for the presentation I was

935
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:44,538
just wondering on the last slide with

936
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:49,579
the cloud and the tracking device was

937
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:52,279
that mediatek tracker and the yes it

938
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:54,739
tracker app you are looking at

939
00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:59,599
that's the tracker used to secure my

940
00:50:54,739 --> 00:51:02,539
mobile my motorcycle because like I just

941
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,089
called to see if trying to steal my

942
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:07,669
morals that because you had a really

943
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:10,339
remote recording you can actually listen

944
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:13,489
in to the audio you can locate it

945
00:51:10,339 --> 00:51:16,189
you can if there is any Shack if you're

946
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:19,009
somebody moving my bike will notify me

947
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:20,769
using a mobile application but the

948
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:23,630
problem is I didn't do a proper

949
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:25,218
segregation so you can actually using

950
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:27,169
the mobile phone to do some transfer

951
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:29,329
missing because you can reverse engineer

952
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:33,549
a plication there's an algorithm to

953
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:38,869
actually like enumerate the server's

954
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:40,939
data to get other people's location so

955
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:42,709
it's like this this things can happen a

956
00:51:40,939 --> 00:51:45,199
lot because those kind of application

957
00:51:42,709 --> 00:51:47,419
you should be developed by the by the

958
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:49,459
maker community not a hacker community

959
00:51:47,419 --> 00:51:52,279
so the maker community is actually using

960
00:51:49,459 --> 00:51:54,348
a tunnel or other like a really a viable

961
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:57,380
module I just mentioned a fingerprint

962
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:59,409
scanner like like serial key board or

963
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:02,749
something that just pulled it together

964
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:04,999
just you'll use what the vendor already

965
00:52:02,749 --> 00:52:07,069
used of providing the protocol like

966
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:09,859
serial protocol not encrypted to

967
00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:11,299
assemble a product so those those

968
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:12,049
platform I usually develop like those

969
00:52:11,299 --> 00:52:14,989
kind of people

970
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:18,559
not any next security measure

971
00:52:14,989 --> 00:52:21,319
implemented so we not only this platform

972
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,229
we have a lot of like like you know the

973
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:27,819
aftermarket you OT be down low for the

974
00:52:24,229 --> 00:52:30,558
cars to use remotely unlock the car or

975
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:32,329
monitoring the car you would you be

976
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:36,140
dangled you buy this device plug into

977
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:40,819
your car so those system also like we've

978
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:42,770
found that next like many many cars we

979
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:46,050
can track using their plan

980
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:48,840
yeah thank you awesome

981
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:49,710
we have another question there keep your

982
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:54,960
hand up

983
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:56,550
oh by the way if you want no more detail

984
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,120
you can come to China because China is

985
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:01,830
like especially Sinden they're like very

986
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,549
good people too in this reverse

987
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:04,950
engineering

988
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:07,110
I'm not seeing a copyright copyright

989
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,790
problem that's like their technique I'm

990
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:12,390
only care about their technique you are

991
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:15,090
using is very amazing personally I've

992
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:18,060
found really interesting to low level

993
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:20,550
silicon or chip level attacks like the

994
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:24,960
EMP attacks and my question is how could

995
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:26,910
we mitigate them actually so this I

996
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:31,020
mentioned this that attack is very

997
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:33,750
hilarious because it was the first the

998
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:36,360
vehicle barreling on the Internet in

999
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:39,000
China is because a certain money uses a

1000
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:41,970
kind of black box and use a block pass

1001
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:47,070
antenna this rage and go to that there's

1002
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:49,439
a Expo force like like smart devices so

1003
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:52,170
Hickel 2x she goes to the expo I'll turn

1004
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,570
the switch I don't know who came here

1005
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:57,210
her this device and it goes to the small

1006
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:59,940
box and column and stuff like three or

1007
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:02,550
five of those marks and I'm self

1008
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,770
automatic so that video says all the

1009
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:09,270
nanny can alter the smart lock just like

1010
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:11,520
hmm it's not that secure so it's not the

1011
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,920
case well when we test this because

1012
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,200
whether it is intentionally or not

1013
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,480
intentionally the vendor the the the

1014
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,569
circuit board port is always like

1015
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:25,670
blocked usually blocked by certain made

1016
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:28,290
or self metal case or metal front panel

1017
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:30,330
may be their intended use to block the

1018
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:32,730
to prevent the hacker from get to the

1019
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:36,120
circuit board but that's also acting as

1020
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:38,220
a Gaussian cage so not all of the most

1021
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:41,940
of the smart now cannot you I'm not

1022
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:43,740
using that way but if you want to that

1023
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,290
you can use and find a certain hole and

1024
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,779
then you insert the antenna and

1025
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:50,720
to that but it's very hard to find a

1026
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:54,590
certain location that will react to this

1027
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,419
and kind of attack because what I know

1028
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:58,310
of is that they are using the

1029
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:00,350
authentication protocol and the truth

1030
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:03,650
transfer protocol and the world using

1031
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:06,680
multiple trigger line to actually

1032
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:09,620
activate the motor motor driver that

1033
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:12,649
have maybe mountain 2 to 9 or Serena why

1034
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:17,859
is for the power supply of this whole

1035
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:20,750
motor driver and 2 for the rotational

1036
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:25,370
direction control so it's very hard to

1037
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:27,320
using one like Tesla coil to activate

1038
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:30,710
all those cheaper to the certain right

1039
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:33,050
state you know thanks for the answer and

1040
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:35,660
really nice presentation thank you

1041
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:38,570
interesting thank you we have time for

1042
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:43,810
one more question so if you have it this

1043
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:43,810
is the moment here just a second

1044
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,470
sorry hi this is more fun

1045
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:53,930
have you tried to hack something and

1046
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:55,520
managed what I mean from your

1047
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:59,210
presentation you managed to take

1048
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:02,000
everything yes so I didn't like to

1049
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:04,130
mention haha introduce too much about my

1050
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,650
country because I don't want here to be

1051
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:09,050
feel like just like a vendor pitch but

1052
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:11,930
my company is a big company like we used

1053
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:13,790
have a 10,000 people we are like belong

1054
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:16,819
to their Security Research Institute

1055
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:19,940
what we do is that we do like like novel

1056
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:21,560
research and that means some many people

1057
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:25,340
won't hack it we won't fight hack it

1058
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:27,259
like the satellites so so this device is

1059
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,060
like just we bought them if you want

1060
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:32,180
hack them we just buy them and hack

1061
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:35,420
their ourselves no I don't have to like

1062
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:42,140
have to be asked by our supervisors to

1063
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:45,920
do some research so so that's that's how

1064
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:52,490
we why we have everything because yeah

1065
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:56,650
we feel yeah thank you sir ya know

1066
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:56,649
Kristina thank you so so much

1067
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:01,780
okay

1068
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,780
[Applause]
