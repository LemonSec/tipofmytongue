1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,758
usual pen tests do not drink much value

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:10,500
but I'm here to show you and to tell you

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,290
a story how it can be different let's

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,820
skip who am i and let's talk about more

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:21,000
interesting stuff customers usually want

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,990
to test their network security but only

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,660
from the publicly available services and

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,049
servers they are pretty much secure

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,170
nowadays sometimes they even want to

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,440
test you one web application the most

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,989
exposed one so he has put a lot of money

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,269
into it and thus it's secure already

13
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,788
once it was different we got a request

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,789
from a customer to test their network

15
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,469
security but also to perform social

16
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,469
engineering we are phone calls and

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,140
emails and to try to access their

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,289
buildings so we started with the

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:06,170
networks can we identified an instance

20
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:09,840
of own cloud server who knows open cloud

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:12,630
Thank You this customer used one cloud

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,659
to share files with their external

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:20,210
partners it's a better solution than

24
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,880
using rapid share the way how I like to

25
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:26,610
make these services is to guess password

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,429
by guessing passwords it's easy to setup

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:34,200
it's fast it's efficient but I didn't

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,600
have logins luckily we found a zero-day

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,200
vulnerability in one of those plugins

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:45,419
that were installed in own cloud this

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:49,200
plug-in leaked currently online users so

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:54,750
even to the even to the unauthenticated

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:58,469
user so that's the bug after hours of

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,829
waiting we collected enough logins to to

35
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:05,158
proceed with password guessing when we

36
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:09,090
tried simple passwords we gained already

37
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:13,730
tons of valid accounts we could download

38
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:20,590
files and upload files but we couldn't

39
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:24,440
run any code we prepared a few scripts

40
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:28,190
for phone calls every time we ask a few

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:32,180
innocent questions and then we asked the

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:37,519
one that was important to us and that is

43
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:42,290
which brand of antivirus do you use many

44
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:45,590
times the employee didn't know one of

45
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:48,200
them even told me I don't know but the

46
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,000
network administrator works at the end

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,959
of the hall let me ask her and said no

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,870
it's not necessary as I said I don't

49
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,510
know we offer them a tool that we

50
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,500
automatically report this information to

51
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:08,298
us it was just enough to run this

52
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:10,970
backdoor - we uploaded it to the own

53
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:15,590
cloud server so it served from their own

54
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:19,420
domain we also faked the outgoing phone

55
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,420
number so it looked more trustworthy

56
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:28,220
we tried spearfishing which is infecting

57
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:31,910
the email attachments for this we try to

58
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:36,709
apply for a job from this effort we

59
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:39,620
never received a connection back so

60
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:41,750
maybe that's my guess maybe they didn't

61
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,220
even open our applications so if you

62
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:48,169
look for a job and you don't get an

63
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,419
answer maybe that's the case every time

64
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:54,079
we saw a login form we tried to get

65
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:56,450
passwords but there is a risk of locking

66
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,299
accounts if there is Microsoft Active

67
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,480
Directory and the policy and it allows

68
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:05,560
only maybe five attempts and then the

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:10,190
account gets locked then it might cause

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,849
trouble to many employees so we used

71
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:17,089
instead a different trick we used only

72
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:22,520
one password and we tried it for many

73
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:24,710
logins we tried a long password that has

74
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,740
uppercase letters and lowercase letters

75
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:31,638
and has numbers something like we

76
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:35,810
30 2019 I'm sure many people will choose

77
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:39,080
this password in the near future this

78
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,669
way we gain access to emails and to

79
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:46,639
their intranet what have you found there

80
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:49,639
in the email there were emails from from

81
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,810
the security department about flash

82
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:56,630
drives that they are allowed to use each

83
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,880
employee got a USB flash drive of a

84
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:03,979
certain type and no other flash drives

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:07,009
were allowed we prepared for this

86
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:10,190
engagement and we bought beautiful pink

87
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:12,440
flash drives from some in shop and we

88
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,800
wanted to put them on a parking lot

89
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,229
maybe bathrooms or just pretend we found

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,039
it on the street while walking a dog and

91
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:25,430
we try to put them to some to some

92
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:28,930
employee and these were not looking the

93
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:32,169
same so we returned them to the eShop

94
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:36,190
what did we find in the intranet

95
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:39,080
there were security measures and

96
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,830
documents about how the buildings and

97
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:48,680
network is organized we use this

98
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:51,979
information later we try to get as close

99
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,070
to the building or inside as close as

100
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:58,400
possible or inside this is how it looked

101
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:03,289
like on Google Maps on the satellite

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,590
view the the wall on the top that's the

103
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:09,620
target around that there is a parking

104
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:13,969
space and there is a fence garden and

105
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,889
houses so if I wanted to go closer I

106
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:19,759
needed to go through this block of

107
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:22,759
houses so I took leaflets advertisement

108
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,039
leaflets and I pretended I'm giving them

109
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,620
to mailboxes actually I had to do

110
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,150
because the owner is checking me and

111
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,099
controlling if I really do if they

112
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,940
allowed me to go in inside the building

113
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:39,919
and then I wanted to go through the

114
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:41,529
garden and then climb over the fence if

115
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,919
not there is something

116
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:47,499
it's not possible or I'm not able to

117
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:51,508
then I will just take USB flash drives

118
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:51,509
and throw them on to the parking lot

119
00:06:51,839 --> 00:07:00,239
when I when I was in the buildings I saw

120
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:05,759
that the fence is a four meter high wall

121
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:10,209
so it didn't work

122
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,839
we tried trash diving and the customer

123
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:16,389
didn't limit us in this he was actually

124
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:20,169
surprised that one of the trash bins was

125
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:23,649
not locked this is a funny picture these

126
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:28,179
are pen testers with diplomas from

127
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:30,549
universities we collected anything that

128
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:34,568
looked like a paper and colleagues put

129
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:36,839
them parts of the papers together the

130
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:40,029
customer was surprised that we found

131
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:45,029
document documents like documentation

132
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:49,929
from the alarm system and similar things

133
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:52,629
but we didn't get inside and we also we

134
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:54,578
wanted to do it and I thought like I

135
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:56,949
will use some lock-picking or something

136
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:59,049
like that this picture is from another

137
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,689
engagement let me share the story

138
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:04,269
quickly we traveled a few hundreds of

139
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:06,489
kilometers to get there it was some

140
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:09,369
industry facility and we received

141
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:11,799
helmets and we had to sign papers that

142
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:14,469
we have to obey security measures safety

143
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:17,638
measures if not and we died and it's our

144
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:21,459
responsibility and we waited for some

145
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,559
part of this facility to shut down so

146
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:26,639
that we can proceed and to actually try

147
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:29,919
something and I wanted to use this time

148
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,068
so I wanted to check the locks that are

149
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,289
on the doors so that next time maybe I

150
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:38,529
will prepare some special lock picks or

151
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:41,979
something like that the workers there

152
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:44,470
they didn't like us so they took it

153
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,809
differently they went outside like more

154
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,920
than 10 of them they went outside and

155
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:52,500
they locked the door twice and said show

156
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,589
us what you got

157
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,960
so I humbly pray and I try to open the

158
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,550
lock and actually did it was not a

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,920
secure lock now I know

160
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:07,410
and suddenly we we were allowed or we

161
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,020
would be allowed to be capable of doing

162
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,780
anything there if we came at time when

163
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,640
there is no one so it changed their

164
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,329
perception when we were there we were

165
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,460
allowed to touch only one optical part

166
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,550
nothing else and suddenly if we came at

167
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,450
different time we could just go to the

168
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,790
controlling computer that controls

169
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:31,500
everything but at this engagement it's

170
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,560
different the lock picking was this

171
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,170
couldn't be done because what we saw on

172
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,699
the internet there were measures about

173
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,910
the receptionist there were two

174
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:46,560
receptionists all the time or should be

175
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:48,209
and when if we wanted to go by car into

176
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,280
the parking lot there there were two

177
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,340
gates there is a receptionist checking

178
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,920
the car there is a gate there is a card

179
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,750
reader there is a camera scanning the

180
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,010
license plate and there is the second

181
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:04,920
gate so we even didn't even try this one

182
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:10,770
and there was this huge fence around

183
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:13,170
that I couldn't jump over but my friend

184
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:18,030
he tried something something different

185
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:20,430
he used the reception something called

186
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:24,930
tailgating there was a lady

187
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:27,239
going inside the building and he was

188
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,880
behind her and tried to go through as

189
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:35,040
well but there was this tourniquet that

190
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:38,460
allows only one person at the time so he

191
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,390
asked her politely if we if he if he can

192
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:46,050
go inside if she allows him to go in and

193
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:50,390
she said use your cart so he had some

194
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:54,420
cart but it was it was a cart from a

195
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:57,830
consulting company not very related to

196
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:02,010
this company so it obviously didn't work

197
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:04,230
so she and so he asked her first would

198
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,600
you can you use your cart and she said

199
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,180
no I

200
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,009
have to leave first but with a reason I

201
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,050
have to push a button like I am living

202
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:15,050
to a doctor or she has to have some

203
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:18,258
reason and then she can enter so this

204
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:23,479
didn't work out so he went back a few

205
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:27,709
meters and asked the receptionist to go

206
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:30,410
in the receptionist was rough who are

207
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:32,149
you meeting with and he was prepared

208
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,399
that he printed out some papers and

209
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,740
presentation from a very boss of the

210
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,730
company so will he read read his name

211
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:44,870
and the receptionist called called one

212
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:49,430
of the assistants the the assistant came

213
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:52,569
down she was very busy and she said you

214
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:55,969
don't have a meeting with our boss but

215
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:58,849
he was allowed to go in with a visitor

216
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:03,550
card and wait on the assistant behind

217
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:06,560
the tourniquet so my friend acted oh

218
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,199
really I don't have my colleague must

219
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,300
have screwed up let me call them and the

220
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:14,240
assistant was busy so she went upstairs

221
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:18,109
to finish her work and he was left

222
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:24,139
behind the tourniquet he was still

223
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:26,180
visible to the receptionist he just took

224
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:30,529
he thing his things put them on the

225
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:32,388
table and he went to bathroom he wanted

226
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:36,860
to leave some flash drives there of

227
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:38,810
course and when he came back he saw that

228
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,769
none of the receptionist are there

229
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:45,410
anymore so he took his things so that it

230
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:47,810
would look like he left but instead he

231
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,600
went inside the building and he walked

232
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:53,329
through the building and to the second

233
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:58,880
connected building and in one of the

234
00:12:53,329 --> 00:13:01,489
halls he met a guy this guy definitely

235
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,259
knew at least looked like he knows my

236
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,670
friend but my friend didn't know this

237
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:08,149
guy so who could it be

238
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:11,269
it was the security guy who ordered us

239
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:15,889
and he knew us from the photos on the

240
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:17,870
series that were that were as part of

241
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:18,910
the communication we didn't know him

242
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,520
personally

243
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,939
so by this only eye contact there was

244
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:31,930
this information exchange that you got

245
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:34,270
us inside we wanted to give the customer

246
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,910
the answer what could an attacker

247
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:40,000
without skills achieve like if we can go

248
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,860
inside all with IT skills and he can be

249
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,340
prepared and know which flash drives are

250
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:51,430
used to sum what we achieved we had

251
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:53,440
access to own cloud but we couldn't run

252
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,370
any code we could only upload and

253
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,970
download files then we had access to

254
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:05,110
personal computers of the employees and

255
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:08,800
we could people - to the servers we got

256
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,960
access to the building as well but most

257
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,300
importantly we gained a customer who was

258
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:17,890
happy with the results and he ordered us

259
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,020
again in this case the customer knew

260
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:25,390
what he wanted he specified it very

261
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:29,199
clearly and very well in the document he

262
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:33,640
specified a broad scope of the test and

263
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:38,500
if we wanted to even broaden it more he

264
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:41,050
didn't stop us this way we could give

265
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:46,500
him more accurate information about the

266
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:54,758
security there thank you for attention

267
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:54,759
[Applause]

268
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,010
are there any questions

269
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,900
hi have you ever been busted on a

270
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:23,210
penetration testing and what have you

271
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:28,300
done at that time pardon pardon testing

272
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:30,470
either physical or software no we were -

273
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,089
actually we we stopped before we got

274
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,400
busted because we had only a limited

275
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:37,550
number of faces that we could use only

276
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,240
the team and we didn't didn't want to we

277
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:44,030
wanted to reuse us we were walking with

278
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:52,580
a dog but if it looked like not very

279
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:56,329
innocent and we didn't do a returning

280
00:15:52,580 --> 00:16:03,050
customer what changes have you seen when

281
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:05,600
they come back asking for another like

282
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,609
giving you more of a free hand but has

283
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,190
it ever been more difficult for a

284
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,230
customer who comes back to you like did

285
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:16,310
they implement the changes and what's

286
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,840
the usual ratio / percentage of changes

287
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:21,859
that you recommend the actually

288
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,200
implement may I rephrase the question is

289
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,280
it like this customer what changes did

290
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:30,100
they apply recommendations from you guys

291
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,339
did they actually implement it and

292
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,950
percentage of recommendations he

293
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,870
implemented all of them he he changed

294
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,870
everything and he even rebuilt the

295
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:46,750
reception so there is a guest area now

296
00:16:41,870 --> 00:17:01,670
that you this is not possible anymore

297
00:16:46,750 --> 00:17:03,770
thank you I see three for two questions

298
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:08,589
there are three on this side and two on

299
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,589
this side okay so who was first

300
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:20,560
yeah if the ha if the guard are armed

301
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:24,399
you continue the pen testing

302
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:29,919
pardon I didn't if the guard are armed

303
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:35,200
the guard if he has gun you know you

304
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:44,410
continue in the pentesting I didn't know

305
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:48,760
I don't think he had the gun yes after

306
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:51,250
you successfully penetrated system was

307
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,870
it hard for you afterwards to speak with

308
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,490
the blue team with a security the

309
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,780
internal security team and explain to

310
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:01,090
them what was what what went wrong and

311
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,060
was it hard to have a discussion with

312
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,830
them on how to better secure in the

313
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,330
future the system the blue team was

314
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,340
actually the one that ordered us and

315
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,230
they were happy with the result I said

316
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,760
wow this is a different when the tests

317
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,970
that we had previously there was some

318
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,590
probably vulnerability scan that was

319
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:24,070
just translated or something like that

320
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,600
so they it was maybe tough for them but

321
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,520
they had a good position and good

322
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,520
relationship with the director probably

323
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:49,240
oh yeah that happens many times like if

324
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:52,300
they order us then they are willing to

325
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,840
cooperate if I think you speak from your

326
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:59,260
from your experience I guess yeah yeah

327
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,449
if not then maybe to build the trust

328
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,460
first like with the workers we came

329
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,520
there only to build trust we actually

330
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:11,620
were not to not allowed to do much first

331
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:13,960

332
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,639
more question here so everybody that

333
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,900
still has questions please approach

334
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,480
Martin during the breaks

335
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:24,700
he will let's thank you for our

336
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,160
presentation I have a very small and

337
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,160
simple question why the usual Penta suck

338
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:36,700
because because they are limited because

339
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
the the scope is very limited and it may

340
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,730
happen that okay the web application

341
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,390
that you want me to test is secure but

342
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:48,190
next to it there is this debugging

343
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,020
instance of the same application and

344
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:55,390
it's very easy to act that happened to

345
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:59,220
me already okay thank you so much Martin

346
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,220
