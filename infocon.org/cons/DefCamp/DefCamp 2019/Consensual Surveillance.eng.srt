1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,960
hi everybody well I have a spoiler alert

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:12,500
so the live demo is off but I will

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,660
explain how it's going because yeah so

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:19,948
as already said my name is Misha Hagen

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:24,330
and I work for Ixia for 13 years now but

6
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:27,330
apart from that I've also a parent for a

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:32,460
little bit over a decade meaning that my

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:35,070
daughter is 11 and even though my

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,800
beloved wife does most of the parenting

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,719
jobs and all the support back there I

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,480
like to brag about it sometimes at

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:48,239
conferences so you know today we're

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,120
going to talk about a specific category

14
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,968
of devices which is kind of shady

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,370
meaning the the GPS tracking devices for

16
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,370
children I don't know how many of you

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:07,908
know about them or or better off how

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:13,920
many of you have children okay okay good

19
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:16,700
well so in the presentation I'm gonna

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,460
I'm going to talk first about my journey

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:23,790
if you will how I got to these devices

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,070
and then I'm going to talk about the

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:32,220
device itself like what are the features

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:36,990
and how it works and then a few of of

25
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:40,170
your privacy underground stuff and the

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,960
conceptual part will come in in the

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:49,799
facts part so I'm going to start with

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:51,780
the journey because well you see when

29
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,299
you when you have a child when you first

30
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,689
have a child it's nothing like you've

31
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,899
imagined the first thing that you know

32
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,969
and shocks you is that they have a mind

33
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,439
of their own

34
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:06,719
it's not like the Hollywood move

35
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,959
Hollywood movies where the child is born

36
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,060
you have some romantic moments okay

37
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,710
maybe once the child wakes up during the

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,450
middle of the night and both of the

39
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,020
parents tired but extremely

40
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,420
understanding go and help the child go

41
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,610
back to sleep and then there is this

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,570
scene where the child plays baseball

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:31,140
because it's American movie and with the

44
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:36,019
father and then that's that it's it's

45
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:41,010
not feeling like that I was saying that

46
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:44,730
it's difficult because they want stuff

47
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,700
they are not just children they they are

48
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,280
independent humans that want to do stuff

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,130
like I don't know lick the floor of the

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,090
train station at some point and you have

51
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,560
to explain with very few words because

52
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:04,080
they don't understand that many few

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:07,350
words that that's not okay and jokes

54
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:12,770
apart the thing is that it brings you

55
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,769
much much joy to see them grow up and

56
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:19,830
there is dessert at this other side

57
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,880
where the child goes sick for example

58
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:26,520
and you suffer with it and at some point

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,070
they grow up a little bit and boom

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,350
independence starts keep kicking in they

61
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,700
want to be independent they want to I

62
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,370
don't know let's say I'm gonna try this

63
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,000
I want to go in this whole store by

64
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,280
myself

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,290
I mean we go together in the furniture

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,430
store but I want to have my own track

67
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:47,519
and that's the point where you start

68
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,300
feeling unsafe because you have to let

69
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,170
go it's no longer right near you and the

70
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:59,010
way historically this has been handled

71
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:02,220
was through some sort of supervision you

72
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,799
go around and see what your child is

73
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:09,480
doing or you have a bigger brother or

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,510
sister that helps with that or you have

75
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:17,670
someone you trust like an aunt or a

76
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:21,539
grandparent you know but now we have

77
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:25,140
technology so what what if what if just

78
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,389
think if I could give her something that

79
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,050
can tell me at any moment where she

80
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:34,499
and we could communicate like a

81
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:38,099
cellphone right no wrong no the

82
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:40,710
cellphone won't do because the IKEA part

83
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:42,870
is really true you went why Kia and she

84
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,239
had her cell phone on her and she

85
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,509
started wandering around and then at

86
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,849
some point we wanted to live and when we

87
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:55,020
wanted to live we called her guess what

88
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:59,248
happened she answered and then we

89
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:03,020
established the meeting point and we met

90
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:07,110
no problem okay I got the child we went

91
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:11,120
to the cash registers and at some point

92
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:14,610
I asked her pay where's your phone I

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,469
don't know okay let's roll back we went

94
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,560
back to the sofa where she was sitting

95
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:21,479
on and there was the phone so the

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,599
problem is not that the phone doesn't

97
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:29,430
have the functions the problem is that

98
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:34,080
the phone is not easily easy easy to

99
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:41,539
reach it they their children they forget

100
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:43,830
easily okay so the journey that's how I

101
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:47,430
started thinking about these tracking

102
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:50,669
devices and the next thing I'm an

103
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:55,860
engineer I said I'm not paying for that

104
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:59,609
I'm building it yep I'm building it and

105
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,939
I started looking for solutions like GSM

106
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,740
modules and GPS modules and how you

107
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:07,949
combine them and how you put them

108
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,520
together and that's just a picture

109
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:13,110
trying to make you understand how much I

110
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:21,299
was suffering because I didn't want to

111
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:24,689
pay the price and yeah well sometime

112
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,909
later I realized that it might take me a

113
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:29,460
couple of years to do it but maybe

114
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,889
there's a bright side after two years I

115
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,899
can look at my child and say hey you've

116
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:39,180
grown up so nicely yeah so maybe family

117
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,849
time throwing family time at it is not

118
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,729
is not the answer

119
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:46,259
then there is this other problem I know

120
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:50,639
I don't know if you are familiar with

121
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:53,819
the carrot cutter joke there was a joke

122
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,449
like what is big ugly consumes a lot of

123
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,610
energy and cuts carrot in five it's a

124
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,399
do-it-yourself project of a carrot

125
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,589
cutter that cuts them in four so that

126
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,259
that's what I ended up it's not a watch

127
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:09,239
it's maybe a sleeve with all kinds of

128
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:14,399
circuits and the backpack of batteries

129
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:16,078
for a full day's work and no no that's

130
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,349
not that's not the way to do it so

131
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:21,389
another another idea that popped up this

132
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:24,628
is just a joke it didn't pop up that but

133
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:27,869
have you have you seen lassie who here

134
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:29,909
has seen lassie ok

135
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:34,079
well unless it was a really smart dog

136
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:36,659
and Timmy was the child that was not so

137
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,519
smart and Timmy always got himself in

138
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,319
trouble but lassie was there to go to

139
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,229
the Father and start barking and the

140
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,709
father was what is Timmy Timmy fell in

141
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,209
the pool in the in the well again well

142
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:51,839
yeah that was it Timmy fell in the well

143
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:53,459
again he had to taste for danger but the

144
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,339
thing is we have a dog and it's really

145
00:07:53,459 --> 00:08:02,879
smart but it's not less it's it's just

146
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:05,969
dog smart so I ended up in the sad

147
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,189
corner of acceptance I had to accept

148
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:15,869
that I have to rely on somebody else to

149
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:19,349
provide me the solution and I okay I

150
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:22,259
spent $50 on it that's the end result

151
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:27,989
I spent $50 on it but started learning

152
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:30,389
about it so what did I get for $50 well

153
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:33,779
the most important thing that I didn't

154
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:36,750
anticipate is that besides it being a

155
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:40,889
cellular phone a very simple cellular

156
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,929
phone it filters the calls so you you

157
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,529
configure some numbers in the agenda

158
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,420
like mom that grandma grandpa

159
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:51,630
so also for that the church child can

160
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,990
select to call so the child cannot call

161
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,050
any other number

162
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,140
but another nice thing about it is that

163
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,420
no one else but for those numbers can

164
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,970
call the child and you'll say yeah sure

165
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,560
but that's already in a cell phone yeah

166
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,750
well how many of you have you can have

167
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,369
configured that for your children's cell

168
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,280
phone like seriously

169
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:16,660
yeah you just it doesn't come by default

170
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,610
you forget about it and I've already

171
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,930
mentioned that the cell phone has some

172
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,940
some drawbacks okay another interesting

173
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:29,109
feature the very feature I bought it for

174
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:31,720
was tracking every of every 10 minutes

175
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,770
or depends how you configure it it sends

176
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,680
the current location to a server and you

177
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:42,699
can you can track and see where the

178
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,829
child is there's another feature it's

179
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,050
called SOS because that that's the main

180
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:50,980
purpose of this kind of devices there

181
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:54,400
are SOS devices they are meant for

182
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,650
children in trouble and I mean not not

183
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,990
real trouble like they fell and they

184
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:02,170
they are injured and they need mommy and

185
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:05,170
daddy like they have an SOS button once

186
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:09,490
pressed the phone starts sending SMS

187
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:12,880
ease with the position starts calling

188
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,340
some predefined numbers and you you can

189
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,130
easily get in touch and then there is

190
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,050
baby monitor or sound guardian as they

191
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,780
call it now and there is a funny story

192
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,370
about this I was with a friend who

193
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,260
bought one of these for their children

194
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,390
and we were trying to configure it and

195
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,810
we didn't we didn't manage to get the

196
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:36,870
data connection to work so last resort

197
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:40,750
we say okay let's call the GSM provider

198
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:45,010
so we call the GSM provider and this guy

199
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:47,080
says well hi I I have one of those

200
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:50,520
watches that I can configure you know

201
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,290
the ones used for spying on children oh

202
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,390
now you gotta stop that man you can't

203
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,480
say that unless you're with friends and

204
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:03,550
people like minded like you okay so no

205
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,200
no not saying that out loud and why he

206
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,760
said it it's not because he wanted to

207
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,800
spy on his children

208
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,839
child but the baby monitor was

209
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,319
previously defined with previously

210
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,440
called

211
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,329
the spy function why because what it

212
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,029
does it gives you access to the

213
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:23,469
microphone of the watch to listen on the

214
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:25,480
surroundings so there's the the privacy

215
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,350
coming kicking in like hey what are you

216
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,899
doing and rest assured the microphone is

217
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,540
so bad you can't hear a thing

218
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:36,699
but still there's a privacy issue maybe

219
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,899
some guys will implement a better

220
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:43,089
microphone over there so thing is that

221
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,310
the expressional child for spying was

222
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:50,220
because of this functions name so they

223
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:52,689
renamed it it sound guardian now yeah so

224
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,139
those are the main features so I had the

225
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:59,310
watch I bought it now I know what it

226
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:04,449
does what its features are next thing

227
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:07,018
consent the next thing is giving it to

228
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:10,209
your child and your child accepting it

229
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,040
so what is the what is the way to do it

230
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:14,800
like you do you go to your child and say

231
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,310
hey here's a nice watch it's colorful

232
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,849
and all

233
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:22,300
can you please wear it no I think that's

234
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:26,529
really wrong and we started explaining

235
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:30,370
to her that we need to communicate we

236
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:33,579
need to know where you are and you need

237
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:37,060
to have a way of contacting us in case

238
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:39,819
of danger and this is a watch that does

239
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,810
this you can call us we can call you we

240
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:46,660
can see your whereabouts and bummer we

241
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,060
can actually activate the microphone and

242
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:55,620
listening on the surrounding noise and

243
00:12:49,060 --> 00:13:00,939
that may be disturbing but question is

244
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:03,310
is it an implant no it's not an implant

245
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,760
and we we talked to her about this and

246
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:09,160
told her well if you need your privacy

247
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,170
take it off I'm ok with it I don't I

248
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,529
will I will not abuse this function I

249
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:18,719
will not access it unless I think you're

250
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,720
in danger and you can't tell me and

251
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,870
if you if you're with a friend and want

252
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,750
to have a private conversation goods

253
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:28,390
conversation just take it off and leave

254
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:34,510
it outside of your room or cover it or

255
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:37,689
it's not working that well anyway so the

256
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,180
thing with privacy is that we are stuck

257
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:43,360
when we hear about this listening on

258
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,120
feature we usually start acting like an

259
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,580
allergic immune system because we

260
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,630
learned about these techniques from NSA

261
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,340
but parents are not NSA parents love

262
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,730
their children and want the best for

263
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,660
them

264
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,400
with some exceptions and those

265
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,930
exceptions I thought I thought really

266
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,060
hard about it because it's an ethical

267
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:08,800
issue those exceptions of parents

268
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:12,280
putting their army boots on and entering

269
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,099
the child life they are not in a good

270
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,829
relationship with their children the

271
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:21,420
child can see the same way the child

272
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,620
slams the room the door from their room

273
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,410
it's the same way they can slammed up

274
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,480
the watch because they hey I'm sorry I

275
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,260
went in the shower and forgot to take it

276
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,089
off yeah right the second one one two

277
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,790
and the third one was accidentally

278
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:40,450
stepped on by my colleagues but that's

279
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:45,150
life so the thing with consent here is

280
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:51,580
that the parties involved are

281
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:58,329
trustworthy so parents you sorry usually

282
00:14:51,580 --> 00:15:00,670
mean well and children usually accept in

283
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,150
case of bad relationship it's not going

284
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:10,500
to work anyway so it's just an SOS

285
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:10,500
device if you accept it the right way

286
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:17,020
next thing child where's it I have the

287
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,280
watch everything good I said well what

288
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,699
if I'm not the only one listening

289
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,800
listening on what if somebody else is

290
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,950
listening what if somebody else can call

291
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,290
her and I'm relying on this white

292
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:32,230
blacklist feature that's not really

293
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,769
working so well so I started thinking

294
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,809
well

295
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:38,160
how can I see what the watch is doing

296
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:40,929
it's it's only communicating over data

297
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,439
connection with the with the mobile

298
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:46,809
carrier and I'm not a security expert

299
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:49,689
and I don't know any way of tapping into

300
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:52,209
that the next thing that popped to mind

301
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:55,449
was well some people wrote software for

302
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:57,790
this so maybe there's a way to access it

303
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:01,959
like a serial console or a dev kit to

304
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:04,059
start looking what's going on and then

305
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:06,910
it struck me the solution was much much

306
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:10,420
easier than I imagined when you buy this

307
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:13,480
watch you have to initially configure it

308
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,719
that's where most people just send it

309
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,989
back to the to the store because it's

310
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,279
somehow hard the initial configuration

311
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:27,489
is done via SMS you craft an SMS command

312
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:31,679
send it to the watch mostly to configure

313
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:34,449
the APN so you get a data connection and

314
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:37,089
usually that's it you set that one and

315
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:39,849
you're okay but there are some cases

316
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:46,660
where the manufacturer forgot to write

317
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:50,379
the correct server IP address into it I

318
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:54,129
can set the server IP address nice nice

319
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:57,129
well the commands look something like

320
00:16:54,129 --> 00:17:01,629
this it's password and then a password

321
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:04,059
mine is one one one five six times then

322
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,860
there's the command then there are some

323
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,480
arguments and the first command you see

324
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:11,020
over there is the one that configures

325
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:15,520
the server so I said to myself well I

326
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:18,879
our server I can be server ok and the

327
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,309
few netcat commands later and the bash

328
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,010
script I was a proxy server for it and

329
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:24,939
started doing stuff with the watch and

330
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,658
see what happens

331
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:31,570
I was except expecting some cryptography

332
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:34,210
over there to protect the data and there

333
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:40,480
was some as you can see I call it PE or

334
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:43,360
plain English it was doing like monitor

335
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,520
and all the commands were in plain

336
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,070
English so I was very very happy because

337
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,350
I started

338
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,570
I did all the actions in the app and I

339
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,209
started documenting all the all that

340
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,769
stuff it does because I thought well if

341
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,230
I can't have the hardware at least I

342
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:59,580
have the software the the app I mean I

343
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,470
don't know what else the watch does

344
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,299
let's get let's be serious maybe it

345
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:09,230
doesn't tons of other things behind the

346
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:15,450
scenes but at least this I can see yeah

347
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:17,879
documented the commands and it was an

348
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,940
easy task and I thought I have to

349
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:28,469
implement the server for once and then

350
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:31,230
the mobile app and then I thought what

351
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,539
if I search these strings on the on my

352
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:39,299
data go search engine because I don't

353
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:41,460
use Google and what came up was well

354
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:43,590
somebody did it what do you know and

355
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,519
it's open source and it's called track

356
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:51,178
car and it's used for monitoring

357
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:53,159
monitoring car fleet because turns out

358
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:57,139
there are a gazillion of these devices

359
00:18:53,159 --> 00:19:00,840
which people use for car tracking and

360
00:18:57,139 --> 00:19:03,990
there is this track car open-source

361
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,428
project which is plug-in able you can

362
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,220
write your own plug-in for your own

363
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:11,759
device and they kind of look the same

364
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:15,029
the commands I plugged in my watch I

365
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,619
installed the server and it worked

366
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,779
partially didn't report the location

367
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:20,789
right it was right in the middle of the

368
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:24,090
ocean but that was something that could

369
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:31,379
be easily fixable by crafting the the

370
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:34,610
plug-in this is a TCP stream I was

371
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:40,918
saying of the of the device with some

372
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:43,110
simple commands then I got another watch

373
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,139
because this one was big and the battery

374
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,570
was starting not to work so good and I

375
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:51,258
said ok let's do it again

376
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:53,960
it was another manufacturer same

377
00:19:51,259 --> 00:20:01,730
architecture it's a mediatek processor

378
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:01,730
and this one didn't work so well

379
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:08,460
so at this point the the watches got

380
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,168
gotten smarter it's starting to use some

381
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,740
cryptography to to encode the messages I

382
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:16,960
don't have an image with those messages

383
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:20,860
it's not TLS or something is not

384
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,230
completely all completely encrypted but

385
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:27,100
the the important parts of the message

386
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,820
are encrypted and I spoke to someone at

387
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,879
work

388
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,158
a colleague of mine that's more grounded

389
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,370
into the security realms like you guys

390
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,080
and he said this is an easy one to crack

391
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:44,739
but I don't have the time I still have

392
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:47,490
to see that and that's pretty much all I

393
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:51,370
had to say about that one

394
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:54,460
so the architecture of this solution is

395
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:57,760
the following you have the GPS watch

396
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:02,200
that once configured sends data to a

397
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:06,190
server which is an Amazon thingy in

398
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,799
Germany and you have an application

399
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:12,059
which is strangely enough the same

400
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:16,750
application for a very big category of

401
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:19,178
devices and you have a unique ID that

402
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:22,000
you associate the watch with with the

403
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:25,960
app and once it's once they are binded

404
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,580
together no one else can add it to their

405
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:34,210
own app and you start seeing the

406
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:37,350
information you are looking for but the

407
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,760
thing here is that device is evolved

408
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:44,350
maybe it's not gonna be a watch maybe

409
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:47,080
it's gonna be a chain or something even

410
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:51,189
smaller that the child can have on them

411
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:56,350
the thing is that it's in the title of

412
00:21:51,190 --> 00:22:01,390
the presentation is consensual is how do

413
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:06,189
you use this this type of devices the

414
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:09,780
right way because it's ugly obviously

415
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:12,400
very sensitive stuff and I think that

416
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:15,990
the way to do it is

417
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:21,070
stop being an idiot and treat your child

418
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:25,150
like an adult in that way and explain

419
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:28,540
very clearly what this does what are the

420
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:31,000
ways to escape it if he or she wants

421
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:34,659
that because it's important to know that

422
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:40,510
you're not enforcing this the child is

423
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:43,300
free to not wear it I like what Google

424
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:47,290
has done with family link I don't know

425
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:49,840
if you installed it so Apple has the

426
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,760
iCloud family and by the way when when

427
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,129
my daughter switched to Android I said

428
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,610
okay well I can I can remove the account

429
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:00,130
from the family and I entered the

430
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:02,379
configuration screen and it said you

431
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,560
cannot remove family members until

432
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,180
they're 16 and I said well I thought I

433
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:13,210
could remove my daughter from the family

434
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:16,690
but seems not yeah so family link does

435
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:19,540
it in a really nice way it tells you the

436
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:22,510
parent but it tells also the child it

437
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,930
says well now your father your mother

438
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:28,690
can do this this this but they cannot do

439
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:31,570
this this dislike peeping on your

440
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:34,950
messages or something and if you do not

441
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,189
agree what do you do smash the phone no

442
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,500
go

443
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:42,430
first of all go and talk to your parents

444
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:45,550
see why they want these things on your

445
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:49,200
phone why do they need to control and it

446
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:53,080
teaches the child to act in a mature

447
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,560
assertive way in case he/she is bothered

448
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,510
by it

449
00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:00,669
and I think the same approach applies

450
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:03,670
here it is it is a device like many many

451
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:06,370
others will come the thing is that it

452
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:09,550
has to be open with regard to what it

453
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:11,790
does and it should use encryption of

454
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,790
course

455
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:22,489
I think is the thinkest light thank you

456
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,489
[Applause]

457
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:26,830
did you make gestures

458
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:47,509
I've started you were able to configure

459
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:49,429
the IP of the device

460
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:51,860
my question is how were you able to find

461
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:55,929
the original IP of the server that it

462
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,928
was good oh it was in the handbook

463
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:02,830
well they say specifically if you live

464
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,830
in Europe you should use this IP and

465
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:19,610
yeah that's how I proxy to the the

466
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:22,779
traffic ok parenting questions are

467
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,779
accepted too I'm a genius

468
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,480
hi and thank you for the presentation

469
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,270
okay my question is what is the first

470
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,100
feature that you would add or the first

471
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,440
thing that you would improve on this

472
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,990
watch okay

473
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,430
well the first thing I would do if I

474
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:53,040
would build this watch was built a

475
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:57,810
hardware switch for the mic I would

476
00:25:53,040 --> 00:26:07,399
disable the mic like hardware because

477
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:10,490
it's it is not okay let's face it okay

478
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,490
thank you
