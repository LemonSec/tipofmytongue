1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
so I need just to test where the

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,450
microphone is working well so do you

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,690
hear me on the backstage ah perfect

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,400
so hello everyone my name is Patrick

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,129
Coons thought and I am representing here

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,630
a tallis talis company that is also a

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,119
Gold Partner of that event so let me

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,430
welcome you also in the name of of

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,380
Dallas and I put these let's say the

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,810
stranger the name for this presentation

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,229
how to exploit cloud adoption for making

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,690
IT more secure and convenient why

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,730
because I was considering that let's say

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,760
once you insure once you let's say

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,709
enable any kind of the security within

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,040
the large organization like enterprise

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,410
companies it typically starts to more to

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,320
bother a user to end user so I would

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,839
like to introduce or to explain or to

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,469
show you how let's say the Tallis

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,829
approach to let's say enablement of any

22
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,960
kind of the security namely for the

23
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,870
situation that you move your IT

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,530
infrastructure from on-prem to cloud do

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,539
not do butter or tube or let's say the

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,790
end user so this is the aim of this

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,080
presentation you will see let's say what

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:19,170
Telus is about what we are doing and

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,420
also I will try to show you some of

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,200
let's say the nice tool that we have for

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,430
the IT security so let's start who we

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,270
are

33
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,549
we recently let's say did a joint

34
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,490
venture between the Noda gemalto and

35
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:39,390
Telus officially it was like the talus

36
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,329
acquires the Gemalto who of you knows at

37
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,250
least one of these titles the Gemalto or

38
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,758
talus just raise your hand so our

39
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,430
perfect so I do not need let's say to

40
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,509
stay more time on that in the total

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:58,469
right now we we have the team of 80,000

42
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:02,250
employees we are in 68 countries

43
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,469
I am from Prague office where our let's

44
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,649
say to base more than 400 employees

45
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,959
mostly for R&D and you can see on that

46
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,590
slide that we invest a lot into the

47
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,739
development of the IT products 1 billion

48
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,130
into the R&D but Telus is not focusing

49
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,950
just and only on a security or IT

50
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,750
security products

51
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:28,200
Telus is also well known for the

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:32,250
investment and their products in

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,339
aerospace in defense in in the space of

54
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,250
the transport transportation and so on

55
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,319
but today I will I will talk mostly

56
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,069
about IT security and the products that

57
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,069
would help you to ensure that once you

58
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,089
move to cloud you will be absolutely

59
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:52,609
secured

60
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:55,620
so before I start with my presentation I

61
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,290
didn't let's say realize that before me

62
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,590
will be Conrad with his artificial

63
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,200
intelligence so I used also his let's

64
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,120
say the use case in in my presentation

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,190
just to explain why it is really

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,920
important to think about the IT security

67
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,690
all so from that perspective that okay

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,220
there are plenty of new and modern

69
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,290
technologies like artificial

70
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:22,140
intelligence machine learning let's say

71
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,420
the big data analysis and it's used

72
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,540
typically or maybe why it was invented

73
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,940
it was for the positive results like by

74
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,030
the let's say device or clever people

75
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,519
but these technologies are also used by

76
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,269
the hackers so we have to think about

77
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,150
that okay

78
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:42,420
the face recognition and deep fake it's

79
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:46,650
something what can be used also for for

80
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,869
the hacker as a tool so this example is

81
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,540
about the deep fake I did and I never

82
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,639
know that that Conrad will let's say

83
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,108
present the same and you can see on the

84
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:01,100
left side is their I think it's a it's a

85
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:04,560
head of the Communist Party in in China

86
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,739
and on the right side it was I have to

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,910
put it back you can see the Prime

88
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:13,650
Minister of Canada no and so based on

89
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,720
the artificial intelligence you can make

90
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,940
or you can create the completely fake

91
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:23,310
videos and based on that you can mimic

92
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:25,409
or let's say mmm to put let's say the

93
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,510
interest of the people into the fake

94
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:29,820
news so based on that

95
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,420
I put just the example that the uk-based

96
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,400
energy company was duped out of let's

97
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,480
say some of the money based on that

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,659
sophisticated deep fake so you have to

99
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,880
imagine that it's it's just the example

100
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,960
of how we can use the artificial

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,020
intelligence for to make fake videos but

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,849
for example this example they're very

103
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,620
used to fake voice let's say that you

104
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,900
can imagine that someone will call you

105
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,270
and it will completely sounds like I

106
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,609
don't know your sister mother or father

107
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,560
and will deeply ask you for to do I

108
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,930
don't know the money transformation or

109
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,330
transfer because of some I don't know

110
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,800
the big issue at the family the at the

111
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:18,900
street so you will not the confirm or

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,780
validate whether these voice is actually

113
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,289
exactly from your father or your mother

114
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,599
or your sister you will just to to use

115
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,780
your emotion and you will believe that

116
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,500
it is definitely the originator who is

117
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:37,080
calling to you so but this is this is

118
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:40,230
what we have to think about in terms of

119
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,539
the IT security that there is let's say

120
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,690
the threat evolution I have mentioned

121
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,460
some of them artificial intelligence

122
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:50,040
quantum computing it's also something

123
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,289
what there is plenty of rumors where the

124
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,620
quantum computers are already there or

125
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:59,010
not there are some of let's say the the

126
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,730
parties that believes that these quantum

127
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:05,280
computers are already there but nobody

128
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:07,320
at say government or for example you can

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,869
imagine that for in the United States

130
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,550
there is also some some nice let's say

131
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,720
the technologies or techniques like want

132
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:18,420
computing do they do they let's say you

133
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,270
publish this information No definitely

134
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,790
they will not tell you that for example

135
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,880
the standard crypto operations that are

136
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:30,810
encrypt by I don't know two kilo keys

137
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,640
will never encrypt let's say the data or

138
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,660
good communication because the quantum

139
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:39,990
computers will be able to decrypt it in

140
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,130
a minute hours or order days so these

141
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,810
techniques are

142
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:48,540
in these days the use by let's say

143
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,380
hackers or the people that would like to

144
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:55,980
steal some the sensitive information and

145
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:59,370
we have to think about what to do so we

146
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:03,180
can we can focus on what we can do but

147
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,520
we can we do not let's say the thing

148
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,710
about that that it's it's possible to do

149
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,080
it's it's mandatory that we have to

150
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,590
think about the basis of of this

151
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,140
security stuff so once someone is

152
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,599
calling you and to make the voice in

153
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,820
that example that I put in the previous

154
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,920
slide what you have to do you have to

155
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,599
somehow verify that the identity of the

156
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,460
people that is calling you for to do

157
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,350
some money transfer is exactly the

158
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,750
identity of the people that you expect

159
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,820
that is on the other side so this is the

160
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,030
identity identity is something what is

161
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,680
currently or recently the main important

162
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:42,270
point what you have to you have to

163
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:47,040
secure it's not let's say in these days

164
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:49,500
to to focus on the security or your

165
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,260
landscape of IT infrastructure no

166
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,260
worries everything is situated on the

167
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,960
identity side on the user side so you

168
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,490
have to be sure that your identity or

169
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,739
the inner deity of the party that is

170
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,610
exchanging any sensitive information is

171
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:08,040
is being secure and the second part of

172
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,860
let's say the foundation of the security

173
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,580
that we are focusing in in Telus is the

174
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:18,300
encryption once anybody is stealing or

175
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,979
getting the sensitive data it's so let's

176
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,050
say you're useless in case these data

177
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,600
are encrypted so you have to focus on

178
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,130
which level on which layer you will

179
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,620
start with the encryption there are

180
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,750
plenty of opportunities plenty of let's

181
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,970
say the options the first of them it's

182
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,270
it's known to all of us that I don't

183
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:38,250
know you can and enable the BitLocker on

184
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,949
on the laptops once someone who is

185
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:44,430
stealing you whole the laptop it will

186
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,020
never been used the data inside but what

187
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,660
about the situation that the laptop is

188
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,540
open and you can get the access inside

189
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,969
so you have to focus on though also to

190
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,069
encryption on the file level and then if

191
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,860
we

192
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,050
like to have let's say the best approach

193
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,330
in the end the data encryption you can

194
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,290
focus also on the application level so

195
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:07,670
once the data are inserted or in play in

196
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,040
place into the application for example

197
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,459
web application it can be encrypted and

198
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,099
distort already in encrypted form so

199
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,550
this is what we are focusing on in in

200
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,920
Tallis I will just I was just the pick

201
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:25,849
up for two of the main let's say two

202
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:30,550
parts of the products or in the solution

203
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:33,590
for the identity identity solution and

204
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,870
for the encryption solution but we have

205
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,240
plenty of others and I believe that I

206
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,670
will mention them during the

207
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,100
presentation so let's focus on the on

208
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,410
the data encryption I think this is the

209
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,560
good example in terms of we started this

210
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,839
presentation with so the movement of IT

211
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,300
infrastructure to cloud so this is the

212
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,880
example that even the city of of the

213
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,800
Amazon is saying that the encryption is

214
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,860
the foundation it is the something but

215
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,520
what is the must one once you consider

216
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:08,000
to move any any data in in Amazon in

217
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,760
Azure in I don't know the IBM cloud it

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,130
doesn't care you have to consider how to

219
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,020
encrypt this data because this is this

220
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:20,870
is the value of your company this is the

221
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:25,579
value that you have to you have to solve

222
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:27,650
so and it's really important that and

223
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,870
think about that that many of these

224
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,780
cloud providers already have to solution

225
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:36,010
for the data encryption if anyone of you

226
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:40,250
is responsible for data encryption and

227
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:42,380
doing some IT outside of your

228
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,970
infrastructure in cloud you know that

229
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,850
there are plenty of options that you can

230
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,770
start to generate the encryption keys

231
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,840
never mind whether it is symmetric keys

232
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,180
or asymmetric keys there is the key

233
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,310
walls and so on but everything is

234
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,010
generated on their own it means that

235
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,829
they use their the system machine and so

236
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:03,500
on also the keyboard or the storage of

237
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:07,250
this key is outside of your control so

238
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,959
even that guys Vernor focus city of the

239
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,600
Amazon is

240
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,628
strictly recommends you that you should

241
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,180
bring your own keys it means that the

242
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:19,339
keys that is generated on your side and

243
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,309
you will prevent the situation that once

244
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:25,879
anything will happen with Amazon or your

245
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:28,699
I don't know the virtual servers or your

246
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:31,160
data you will still be the holder of the

247
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:33,979
key and you will you will let's say you

248
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,399
will be only one who will be able to to

249
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,459
dispose these data so once we look at on

250
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,889
the portfolio that we approaching or

251
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:45,559
recommend to to the customer I have

252
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:47,720
started with this slide because it's it

253
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:51,170
shows you let's say the layers that you

254
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,449
can implement the encryption itself as a

255
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,479
most let's say the easier way once you

256
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:58,490
look at under let's say how hard how

257
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,249
easy is to implement you can look at

258
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,529
from the bottom to up is to implement

259
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:06,319
the encryption on the disk level so it

260
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:10,189
means as I I used the example of the

261
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:11,689
BitLocker so you can you can you can

262
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:16,279
implement the encryption of the sale

263
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:19,009
order of the whole disk layer what is

264
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,949
the let's say the typical most typical

265
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:24,230
scenarios on customer side is to use the

266
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:27,378
encryption on the file level so you can

267
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:30,079
imagine that once you decided which file

268
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:32,589
or which folder which type of data will

269
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,660
be encrypted you can also to play a

270
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:38,990
let's call it the game with the access

271
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,790
management so you can you can set you

272
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,290
know the transparent encryption for

273
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:47,209
those users who are let's say the who

274
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,929
should have to access to the to those

275
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:53,959
data and these data are transparent you

276
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:56,329
can imagine it for example for financial

277
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:59,089
data so all people that are for example

278
00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:02,299
in Active Directory in the group of

279
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:04,670
financial division can have the access

280
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:07,040
to those data and these data will be for

281
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:11,599
them transparently visible so there will

282
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,790
be the full four numbers for names all

283
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,269
these sensitive information for those

284
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,949
users who belongs to to the group of

285
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:21,740
privileged users for example root

286
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:22,729
administrators or others these data can

287
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,579
be accessible

288
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,060
for example they can read the date of

289
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:31,969
the of the creation of this file they

290
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,550
can check the size of the file but once

291
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,410
they look at inside the file the data

292
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,550
will be encrypted so it will not be

293
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,160
let's say

294
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:43,639
possible to be somehow in a proper way

295
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,910
used by the privileged users that do not

296
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:49,190
have anything with the financial data so

297
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,649
this is really really good solution

298
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:55,430
really easy to to implement we call it

299
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:57,290
or metric transparent encryption but

300
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,769
there are plenty of let's say the risk

301
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:03,709
still behind that so you can you can see

302
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:06,260
that there is there is also the

303
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:09,170
possibility to put the more secure way

304
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,990
the solution for to encrypt the data I

305
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:16,670
have mention it that it's for metric

306
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:21,589
application solution that will allow you

307
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:25,550
to base on the API that is open from the

308
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:27,019
volumetric solution to and provide it to

309
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,689
the enter

310
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:34,519
I'd say the developers or end-users to

311
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:38,420
develop the solution that during the

312
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:42,010
time once you insert or you place the

313
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:45,229
data into the application these data are

314
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:48,620
encrypted and stored into the into the

315
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:51,230
database directly in encrypted form and

316
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,230
how does it look for the end-user as I

317
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:58,670
showed you in the on the file system

318
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,860
level or layer for the those users that

319
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,560
belongs to financial services for

320
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,750
example they can see these data because

321
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,670
they have the access to those keys that

322
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,940
are responsible for the data encryption

323
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:14,209
they can see these data are encrypted so

324
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,880
the data name surname address I don't

325
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:18,410
know the weight or I don't know the

326
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,230
mortgage size or something like that

327
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,449
they can see it transparently so for

328
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,000
them it looks like the data are not

329
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:29,510
encrypted and for those users that do

330
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,750
not have access to to these data

331
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:35,269
encryption keys they will see these data

332
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,740
encrypted there is also plenty of other

333
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,270
options like tokenization

334
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,320
and data masking against the one but I

335
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:44,750
will mention it later so this is the

336
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,690
structure of of the solution you can

337
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:50,779
imagine that many of company's

338
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:53,570
enterprise customers are using plenty of

339
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:56,689
different solution for different layers

340
00:15:53,570 --> 00:16:00,680
for once we are talking about the layer

341
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:04,040
of of the data that are stored on the

342
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,529
file on the on the system level they use

343
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,779
I don't know the solution for that

344
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:13,970
particular way once we are talking about

345
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:16,970
application encryption it's it's used

346
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:20,000
the different solution so we are

347
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,279
offering to to those customer let's say

348
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,279
the one single platform that is capable

349
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:28,550
to do transparent encryption for it

350
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,850
never let's say it doesn't care whether

351
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:34,880
it is structured or unstructured data we

352
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:37,970
are able to to manage those data on

353
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:42,170
various of operational system on Windows

354
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,240
or Linux and others we can also

355
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:49,219
introduce by the application encryption

356
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,700
the device manner of the let's say the

357
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,620
encryption of the data from application

358
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,480
side and it's called format present with

359
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,020
encryption what does it mean it means

360
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:05,900
that once you for example to put into

361
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:09,889
the field of I don't know the post

362
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:13,220
office number the data will be encrypted

363
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,020
by that way that it will look these

364
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:19,309
encrypted format will look the same like

365
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,589
the original side also the same you can

366
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:24,170
set for the name surname street address

367
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,869
and so on so from first have a look on

368
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,450
that encrypted data it will look like

369
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:32,780
the original data like these data are

370
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:35,360
unencrypted so it's a good for that

371
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,790
let's say the situation that you do not

372
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,340
want to change any anything on the

373
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,740
database side you do not want to change

374
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:46,580
anything on on the storage size

375
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,760
everything will be will be the same the

376
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,668
encryption is one of the techniques that

377
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,999
helps you to

378
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:58,399
let's say to secure the sensitive data

379
00:17:55,999 --> 00:18:00,229
that coming into your organization

380
00:17:58,399 --> 00:18:03,678
through the application level but you

381
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:06,320
can also leverage the tokenization or

382
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,989
data masking so you can just do for

383
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,749
example to mask part of the data or you

384
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:16,549
can just exchange the data bar sound by

385
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:18,019
some token I have mentioned also that in

386
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:19,729
these days there are plenty of

387
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:22,279
organization that do not operate the

388
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:24,320
data just inside of their infrastructure

389
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,960
that all of these databases or

390
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,379
applications are under their hands but

391
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,929
there are also let's say many of

392
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:35,988
applications or many of data stored in

393
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:38,659
the cloud so in these days it's not

394
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:41,479
let's say black or white it means that

395
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,369
ok we can we can do the encryption of

396
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:45,529
the data that are under our

397
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:48,139
responsibility inside our infrastructure

398
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:50,690
but what we will do in in cloud in

399
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:55,580
Amazon in Azure so based on this

400
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:58,399
technology we are able also to in to

401
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,830
interchange or to integrate these

402
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:05,570
keywords from Amazon from I don't know

403
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:10,330
among as your Salesforce or others the

404
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:13,908
cloud providers and the benefit of this

405
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:17,689
integration between the four metric key

406
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:20,239
management and and cloud let's say the

407
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,849
provider is that you can create the

408
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:23,720
encryption keys on your site it will be

409
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:27,019
generated

410
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,590
maybe the that can be implemented also

411
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:33,559
the the most the second way of the

412
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:36,470
generation of the key on HSM side we are

413
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:39,859
also the one of the biggest provider or

414
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:42,470
resource of the hardware security

415
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:45,049
modules so you can imagine that the data

416
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:47,869
itself or encrypt encryption keys will

417
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:50,539
be generated on HSM side on hardware

418
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:53,359
security modules it will be populated to

419
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:56,330
to ensure or to to Amazon Web Services

420
00:19:53,359 --> 00:20:00,619
and once anything will be will be

421
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:04,060
encrypted on on the cloud side it will

422
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:09,220
be still holded by yourself or your

423
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:11,110
let's say HSM solution also it it let's

424
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,460
save the solve the situation that

425
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:18,790
anybody is for example stealing your or

426
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,580
steals your encryption keys on the on

427
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:24,280
the cloud platform you will still have

428
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:27,760
the backup of these encryption keys on

429
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,820
on the keyboard that is stored in the in

430
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,870
our system and it can be the backup back

431
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,689
to to issue or to Amazon Web Services

432
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:39,610
there is also the integration with

433
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,890
transparent data encryption that is most

434
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:44,610
common scenarios for the database

435
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:48,910
encryption so these technologies can be

436
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:53,290
integrated with 4matic solution how does

437
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:56,050
it look in the real scenarios once you

438
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:59,649
enable the TDE on for example oracle

439
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:01,480
database you can you can set that the

440
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:05,650
crypto materials will not be stored

441
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:09,780
directly in on master database you can

442
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:13,590
you can store these crypto materials on

443
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:16,840
external hardware security module and

444
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:19,480
the benefit of it is that there are

445
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,209
plenty of use cases or situation on the

446
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:27,460
real life the scenarios that for example

447
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:32,080
the uber was hacked by let's say the

448
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:33,270
hackers that that realized that in the

449
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,310
master database

450
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:39,670
there are store the keys that encrypt

451
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:42,429
the sensitive information in in other

452
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:45,000
tables in other databases so by this

453
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:48,220
solution you can get the benefit that

454
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,830
once anybody is getting the access to

455
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,320
your databases to your sensitive

456
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,570
sensitive information the encryption

457
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,050
keys will be still stored on on your

458
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,929
side

459
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:03,370
but based on that principles you will

460
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:05,710
never lose the access to to your data so

461
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:08,350
this is the scenario sources situation

462
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,930
that we see mostly on on the customer

463
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,300
side that plenty of different solution

464
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,790
for different scenarios for file

465
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,440
encryption cloud encryption and so on so

466
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:21,580
this is the solution that we

467
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:26,050
offering one single platform that can

468
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:30,570
that can solve the whole encryption for

469
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:33,430
different layers different the use cases

470
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:36,820
in terms of the type of the

471
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:39,730
implementation we can implement the key

472
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,850
management solution as a hardware

473
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,950
appliance that can be also integrated

474
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,679
with hardware security module as I

475
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,950
mentioned that is the most secure way

476
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:54,280
how to store generate the encryption

477
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:58,510
materials or it can be also to implement

478
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:00,700
it as a VM appliance so you can

479
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,210
implement it in your infrastructure that

480
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,700
way

481
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:08,380
I will focus slightly on the four metric

482
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,960
transparent encryption it is the

483
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,440
encryption that is on the layer that we

484
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,170
solve this mostly in most scenarios so

485
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,900
to end customers it means that they do

486
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:22,870
not need to implement anything on the

487
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:27,940
application layer they do not need to do

488
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:30,729
any changes on database layer they just

489
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,970
need to implement we call it the agent

490
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:36,790
on the particular operational system so

491
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,560
you can implement the the volumetric

492
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,110
transparent encryption on Windows

493
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,780
machine on Linux machine and then you

494
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,570
can point just the encryption on the

495
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:50,170
particular folder or particular file and

496
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:53,590
then you can set the let's say access

497
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:58,180
control on that particular field or

498
00:23:53,590 --> 00:24:01,720
particular the file set or order itself

499
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:03,370
so from the end user perspective as I

500
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,120
mentioned in the in the let's say the

501
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,949
first slide that the security itself or

502
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,070
implementation of any kind of the

503
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:16,120
security can start to somehow do butter

504
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:19,080
or somehow let's say the block end-users

505
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,689
to use these the security techniques

506
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,790
it's it's a good to to know that the

507
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,400
volumetric transparent encryption is for

508
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:29,620
those end-users absolutely transparent

509
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,650
so they do not know that the the data

510
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:37,070
itself are encrypted

511
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:40,100
so how does it look from the technical

512
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:45,250
perspective for example this is the this

513
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:50,330
is the the command line of the access to

514
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:54,700
to lineage server and you see that some

515
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:59,600
of the SU user is is trying to get

516
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:02,300
access to to some file and they've got

517
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,139
the information that this file is

518
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,909
encrypted and also there is apply the

519
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,000
access management so they do not have

520
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:15,980
the access privileges to to see these to

521
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,470
see those data what extension is we are

522
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,600
able to to put on the top of the vomit

523
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:23,180
Eric transparent encryption is live data

524
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,689
transformation this is a really good

525
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:30,080
example where many of customer are

526
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:33,170
stacking with the standard solution that

527
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:38,210
once you encrypt any any data you will

528
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:42,140
need to be sure that you need in any day

529
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:44,090
to encrypt this data once you decided to

530
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,580
rotate the key that is responsible for

531
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,949
encrypt those data so what you will do

532
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:52,460
typically if we are talking about the

533
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:55,460
mass of sensitive data you have to stop

534
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:59,660
your operations that operating your data

535
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:01,760
then you can encrypt or decrypt and then

536
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,920
equipped with the new key those data and

537
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,620
then start your operations with those

538
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,150
data so for metric live data

539
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,629
transformation is the technique that

540
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:13,610
allows you to during the time that for

541
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,650
example the database that is encrypted

542
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:20,330
and is being massively used by the

543
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:23,360
reading/writing data will start let's

544
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:26,480
say the rotation of the of the key will

545
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,870
not influence these end users so it will

546
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,640
allows you to rotate the data rotate the

547
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,469
encryption key and those data can be

548
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,540
used during that time of the rotation

549
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:39,820
key so it's really really popular on the

550
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:43,500
market that you can imagine that the big

551
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:47,879
companies like telecommunication the

552
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:51,539
the banks and and so on can't stop their

553
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,900
business during the encryption of of

554
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:58,230
those keys of those data that are

555
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,610
encrypted by by the keys we have also

556
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:04,890
the capabilities to implement the

557
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:09,120
encryption on the layer of the container

558
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:11,340
so if you are familiar with any any kind

559
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,699
of the containers like a doctor

560
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:17,149
openshift you can you can you do you

561
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,039
should know that there are plenty of

562
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:22,260
let's say the way how you can store the

563
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:24,629
data the data can be stored inside of

564
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,580
the container or you can be these data

565
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,580
can be stored also outside of these

566
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:32,780
containers so we have the possibilities

567
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:35,220
to encrypt both of these scenarios

568
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:39,299
inside or outside of the container

569
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:42,900
itself we have also the certified

570
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:45,600
solution for SAP HANA solution the big

571
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,530
analytics tool that is operating

572
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:53,039
recently mostly in on the cloud side so

573
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:55,860
we are proven that this solution is

574
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,450
capable to encrypt this huge amount of

575
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,879
the data and if anybody of you is

576
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:05,820
focusing on the security intelligence it

577
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,100
means the cm or load management we have

578
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,200
plenty of connectors so that are

579
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,770
pre-built for the getting the

580
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,500
information from Varro metric itself to

581
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:19,110
the CM or for to lock management

582
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,210
solution and for those the platform like

583
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,969
CM or lock management you can get the

584
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:29,280
information who is trying to get access

585
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:31,679
to to encrypt the data that are that do

586
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,809
not they these users do not have the

587
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,980
access to those data so based on that

588
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:42,600
they can do a correlation of that event

589
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:44,460
and let's say evaluate so what's

590
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:49,789
happened and why this employee or the

591
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:53,210
user is doing this strange behavior so

592
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:55,559
once we were talking about a ver metric

593
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,669
transparent encryption I mentioned that

594
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,918
it's easy to in

595
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:01,049
because it's just about the installation

596
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:04,950
of the agent on the particular

597
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:08,999
operational system on Windows or Linux

598
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,980
machine and that's it it means that the

599
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:14,850
implementation is done within few days

600
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,279
you have to just to adjust access

601
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,799
control mechanism who will get access to

602
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,460
to which data what encryption key will

603
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:26,309
be used for which particular folder but

604
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,950
in terms of the application encryption

605
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:33,989
it's the situation totally different you

606
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:37,200
have to involve the developers and

607
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:40,529
through the REST API or other api's that

608
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,440
we have open for that technology you can

609
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:45,029
leverage let's say the encryption from

610
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,460
application layer just for better

611
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:50,190
visibility on what's what's happened

612
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,739
this is the example of the securing the

613
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:56,220
credit card data that is going through

614
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:58,830
the web server so once you put the

615
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:02,100
original data to the application these

616
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,309
data will call through the API the

617
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,168
volumetric data security management

618
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:09,749
these data will be encrypted and stored

619
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:12,269
in the in the database in encrypted form

620
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:14,669
this is really simple scenarios and

621
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:17,639
behind that is just let's say the

622
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:19,769
implementation by the API so everything

623
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:22,830
is prepared for the developers just to

624
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:26,700
navigate that the data before it will go

625
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:29,158
it will be before it will know stored

626
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,019
those data into database will call

627
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,679
before that for metric application

628
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:37,100
security solution so I have mentioned

629
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,590
that encryption is one of the form of

630
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:43,678
securing the data but also for the other

631
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,499
purposes it can be used for example for

632
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,769
the credit card is mostly used the data

633
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:52,049
masking or the tokenization so we have

634
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:55,139
also the capability to introduce the

635
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:58,379
tokenization into that into that

636
00:30:55,139 --> 00:31:00,928
particular use case so it looks

637
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:04,289
absolutely the similar or absolutely the

638
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:07,769
same it means that instead of to call by

639
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:10,410
the API the encryption or encrypt and

640
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:13,290
then some of the commands you can

641
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:15,150
called just to tokenize or deco can dice

642
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,430
based on the use case that that you have

643
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:21,960
in front of you this is the capabilities

644
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:24,680
of the application crypto suet so on the

645
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,780
left side you can see that there are

646
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:31,440
let's say the integration possibilities

647
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:34,410
through the REST API see java.net most

648
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:40,050
typical protocols most typical let's say

649
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:44,880
way how to how to do it so this is how

650
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:48,540
does it look in the real real case in

651
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:53,190
case of the hardware appliance so you

652
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:57,600
will get these this machine that is

653
00:31:53,190 --> 00:32:00,030
being used with all of these let's say

654
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,909
the use cases for transparent data

655
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:07,170
encryption with the database for the

656
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:09,030
database you can also use the volumetric

657
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:12,060
transparent encryption is up to you

658
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:15,990
whether you will invoke or leverage the

659
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:19,050
usage of embedded transparent data

660
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:22,680
encryption or the encryption that we are

661
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:27,090
using for the application I have already

662
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:29,760
mentioned it that through the any kind

663
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:33,959
of the API you can you can encrypt the

664
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:38,640
data on the application level so this is

665
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,980
the example just of let's say security

666
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,650
intelligence the solution it means the

667
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,290
same solutions bank IBM rather or

668
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:49,490
Microsoft arcsight it's the most typical

669
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:55,460
scenarios that we populate the data from

670
00:32:49,490 --> 00:33:00,090
our metric solution to this the CM

671
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:03,000
consumers and because we have also the

672
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:06,510
prepared from these vendors the

673
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,480
connectors they can they can get the

674
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:12,650
visibility of what happen with encrypted

675
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,900
data and who is accessing those data

676
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:18,930
this is an example from from Splunk so

677
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:22,740
there is a nice scenarios that you can

678
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:25,770
see that who is make dude

679
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,410
in behavior that is trying to get and

680
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:31,980
read data from the file you will see the

681
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:37,860
information who when what is accessing

682
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:40,800
and how it was happened I have mentioned

683
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:44,580
also let's say the movement of the IT

684
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:48,629
infrastructure to cloud so in that case

685
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:51,540
we can offer let's call it let's say the

686
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:54,570
bridge that will interchange the crypto

687
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:57,360
materials between the war metric

688
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:00,720
solution and those the cloud providers

689
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:04,020
and the benefit itself is if you

690
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,690
remember the slide with the CTO of the

691
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,899
Amazon it's that you are the owner of

692
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,899
the keys you will never lose the access

693
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:15,989
to to these crypto keys and this is the

694
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:19,379
basis of of the let's say the security

695
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:22,109
in the in the recent day so once you

696
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:24,089
encrypt any any data a nobody is care

697
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:26,760
about to stealing your data everybody is

698
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,270
focusing on to get the access to to your

699
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,399
keys

700
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:32,759
so once the keys will be stored inside

701
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:35,368
of the of these clouds it's not under

702
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,800
your control so we would strictly let's

703
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:40,740
say recommend you to to have the keys

704
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,869
under your control and even better you

705
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,939
should let's say store these data on

706
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:49,440
hardware security modules it's the best

707
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:52,970
way how to do it so it was about the

708
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:58,020
let's say the first part of how you can

709
00:34:52,969 --> 00:35:00,868
fight against the situation with for

710
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:03,660
example the artificial intelligence with

711
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:06,240
the modern techniques that is being

712
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,279
leveraged by by the hackers but the

713
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:14,279
second is that you would like to secure

714
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:17,310
somehow your identity your let's say to

715
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,320
be sure that if any point any I don't

716
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,810
know user to user is communicate it's

717
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,200
definitely this user that you trust to

718
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:27,330
if any endpoint is representing by I

719
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,910
don't know server to I don't know the

720
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:32,279
end user and some laptop you have to be

721
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:34,859
sure that this communication is between

722
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,590
the user that they trust to each other

723
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:40,069
so both for

724
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:42,590
that pull poses for death let's say the

725
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,690
trust we are using the authentication

726
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,630
authentication of the end-users

727
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:50,060
authentication of the servers so if you

728
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,730
have a look on some statistics or some

729
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:55,520
some data some reports we can see that

730
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:59,210
this is the report from the cyber risk

731
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:04,040
analytics from that year that still the

732
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:05,900
interest of let's say of the hackers or

733
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,360
the people that are looking at the

734
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,820
stealing some sensitive data is on the

735
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:14,000
on the credential so it is much easier

736
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:17,390
way than to steal your data than to try

737
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,300
to find some some encryption keys it's

738
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:22,339
much easier to steal the credentials get

739
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,800
the access to to your application to

740
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,930
your data and just to get and grab and

741
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,790
collect these sensitive information so

742
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:35,029
how we can help with with this task we

743
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:36,710
are approaching the solution that is

744
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,810
combined multi-factor authentication

745
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,660
with single sign on and access

746
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:44,120
management so you can find on the market

747
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,600
many of the solution that is focused on

748
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,880
the multi-factor authentication I also

749
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,830
mentioned that there are many of the

750
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,530
solution that is provided by the cloud

751
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:56,990
providers like Microsoft like IBM or

752
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:59,240
others but they are strictly focused on

753
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,790
their own landscape but if we are

754
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,490
talking about the enterprise customers

755
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,410
they use many of technologies many of

756
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,839
cloud services and they would like to

757
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:13,310
have just the only one let's say the

758
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:16,880
solution system or or the solution that

759
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:19,820
that will be will be possible to be used

760
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,250
for all of these technologies all these

761
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,320
the application inside of their

762
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:28,610
infrastructure or outside it means in

763
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,500
the cloud so and multi-factor

764
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,780
authentication is only one of the

765
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,350
principle that okay you will use some

766
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:38,810
other other platform other factor of the

767
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:42,080
authentication but you would like to

768
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:44,330
also to manage somehow that once anybody

769
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,660
has the access to to our infrastructure

770
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:49,460
to your application that these access

771
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,480
this token the access token can be

772
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,760
possible

773
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,980
to be used to other application and it's

774
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,480
being possible to do it with the with

775
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,960
the session with the handling of the

776
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,060
session like single sign-on but okay if

777
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,609
you will allow two people that will get

778
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,890
the the access to to your infrastructure

779
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:11,480
for example to get the valid session

780
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:14,629
token' are you are you let's say willing

781
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,240
to give to those user to access to your

782
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:21,380
application not it's not let's say the

783
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:24,618
real example real scenarios on the on

784
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:28,010
the enterprise level so most typical

785
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:31,190
scenario is that ok I will prove that

786
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,840
it's me it's for example done by some

787
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:36,290
multi-factor authentication on a mobile

788
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:39,350
phone or biometric solution or by some

789
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:42,020
chip cards but then I would like to to

790
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:44,029
decide whether this user will have the

791
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:48,619
access to I don't know to some financial

792
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:50,840
application to some HR module to CRM

793
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:52,490
module and others and you can decide on

794
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,040
that based on the access management

795
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:57,950
control that we provide to customer as

796
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,380
well so this is the solution that that

797
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,629
we offer to to those customers that are

798
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,630
willing to to have multi-factor

799
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:08,510
authentication single sign-on and also

800
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,480
the access management in one kind of the

801
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:14,720
solution so how does it work

802
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,869
the first of all we offer many of the

803
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,890
ways how to identify the customer or end

804
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:25,340
user for the multi-factor authentication

805
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:27,980
the most common is SMS biometric on the

806
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:31,460
mobile phone OTP push it means that you

807
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:33,470
will get the notification into the

808
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,720
particular application that is installed

809
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,879
on your on your mobile phone and then

810
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,490
you will just use your fingerprints or

811
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,650
you will get you will put just the pin

812
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:45,220
into that application and you will prove

813
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:49,609
that it's you it's it's the identity

814
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:54,169
program solution you can get also for

815
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:57,859
that that use case the hardware module

816
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,590
it means that you will get the token on

817
00:39:57,859 --> 00:40:03,350
which will be even or time-based

818
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:05,900
the pain one time

819
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,819
password pin that you will just to type

820
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,310
into the into the application that is

821
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,770
acquiring for for that pin or you can

822
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:14,840
leverage also your PK infrastructure if

823
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,570
you have already implemented some chip

824
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:20,050
cards that you are using for your PK i

825
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:24,470
we can use it also for the identity

826
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:26,660
identity of the end user then once you

827
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:29,810
are validated that it's you it's it's

828
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:32,509
the user that would get the access to

829
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:34,940
some application we can assess whether

830
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:39,110
the access to those application is going

831
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:41,480
through the right device for example but

832
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:43,820
it is going through the validated the

833
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,040
company device or whether this access is

834
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:49,490
going through the mobile phone that is

835
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,930
proven or whether it is coming through

836
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:54,649
the network I don't know through the

837
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:56,589
wave VPN or from some public hotels the

838
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:59,720
Wi-Fi and based on that information

839
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:02,600
whether it is coming from that device or

840
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:05,569
another let's say operational system it

841
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,640
will apply the appropriate the access

842
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:10,790
controls so it will allow you to access

843
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,980
or disable to access and it's much let's

844
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:16,340
say divisor it can also the decide

845
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:18,620
whether for death access to the

846
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,750
application will be allowed just without

847
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:23,210
getting the access from the let's say

848
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:24,560
the session or whether it will ask you

849
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:27,260
again for the multi-factor

850
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:31,640
authentication so you can identify

851
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:34,220
yourself again so how does it look in in

852
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,080
the real life scenarios you will get you

853
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,680
would like to get access for example to

854
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:42,620
office 365 and you are from the group of

855
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,529
Sisu it so based on that you will get

856
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:47,720
the access to to application that is in

857
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,520
the list and then you can decide in the

858
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,520
application in there as an administrator

859
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,590
you can you can grant or deny the access

860
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:59,780
to those users from the group Sisu it

861
00:41:54,590 --> 00:42:03,460
and you will ask or you will enforce for

862
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:06,050
every access attempt to be to be

863
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:09,170
identified by the password and by the

864
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:11,300
token-based authentication there can be

865
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,070
also to implemented so let's say the

866
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,940
integration with the Kerberos tickets

867
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,880
with the PKI in a in first

868
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:23,710
and based on that you can let's say the

869
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,510
a just or you can somehow the edges the

870
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:28,480
policies for your company which

871
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:30,340
application will be accessible just with

872
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,000
the password for example from Active

873
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:38,830
Directory or you will have to to put the

874
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:42,040
OTP into that so this is just the basic

875
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:44,590
let's say the approach how to avoid the

876
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,029
situation that there are plenty of let's

877
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:48,670
say two modern technologies like

878
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:52,240
artificial intelligence or let's say

879
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:54,160
machine learning solution but once you

880
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,939
will stick with the basis of or

881
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,520
elementary the security foundations like

882
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:03,640
the data encryption and multi-factor

883
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:06,040
authentication you will not lose let's

884
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,339
say the control of your data it is it is

885
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:12,279
the basis that you have to keep in mind

886
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:16,030
before you will leverage any of the

887
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,830
security solution in your company so it

888
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,600
is my let's say the recommendation to

889
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:23,259
you and I believe that once you stick

890
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:26,200
with those principles or recommendation

891
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,670
you know you will be secure so thank you

892
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:50,710
for your attention

893
00:43:27,670 --> 00:44:02,350
if there is any questions I will be I do

894
00:43:50,710 --> 00:44:05,560
not yeah to be really honest I was

895
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:08,589
working for Micro Focus before I joined

896
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:12,160
Dallas so I can compare those let's say

897
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:14,520
the solution together I think that the

898
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,100
talus is more stronger in terms of

899
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,960
transparent encryption so there are two

900
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:23,220
possibilities as I mentioned for example

901
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,990
for database you can leverage the TDE

902
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:29,200
capabilities embedded capabilities of

903
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:31,270
Oracle MySQL or Microsoft SQL

904
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,910
and it's really well integrated with our

905
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:37,390
solution Telus solution and also the ver

906
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:39,190
metric life data transformation is

907
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:40,020
something what is missing two to

908
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,750
microfocus

909
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,490
solution for other areas for example

910
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:48,010
that is leveraging the application level

911
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,669
security it means that it's leveraging

912
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:53,579
PKI

913
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:56,800
CS 11 the protocols are the same in

914
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:59,770
interface is the same api like restful

915
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,260
api c java and so on it looks pretty

916
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:04,599
similar but the most important part is

917
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:07,089
the volumetric transparent encryption

918
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:11,710
that is I think missing right now in in

919
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:15,450
micro focus any other there's a question

920
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,450
over there if you can give a microphone

921
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:37,420
hello so actually I have two questions

922
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:41,500
first question would be what does any of

923
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:43,810
the HSM provided by Tallis have key

924
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:46,390
attestation feature which means you get

925
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:48,610
back sign token from the HSM proving

926
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,680
that the keys that you are using in for

927
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,450
your applications are basically

928
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,740
generated and managed directly by the

929
00:45:52,450 --> 00:46:01,569
HSM for so yeah this is all let's say

930
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:03,939
for a symmetric Keys we sort let's say

931
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:07,480
the root of trust or the master keys

932
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:10,630
inside of the HSM all the derive the the

933
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:13,120
keys are stored or can be stored in the

934
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,070
key management solution itself or can be

935
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,650
stored as well in the HSM so you can

936
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:21,220
decide on what level you would like to

937
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:25,540
to be secure on HSM side but the primary

938
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:28,149
or the let's say the encryption keys the

939
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:30,430
private keys are stored on HSM side once

940
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,500
it is integrated with the with the key

941
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:35,259
management if there is no integration

942
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:38,050
you can you can operate also the key

943
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:41,110
management solution voltage for metric

944
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:44,170
solution without HSM and all data will

945
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:48,160
be stored in an encrypted form on on the

946
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:50,230
data base level inside of the of the

947
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,710
vore metric if there is the integration

948
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:56,140
with HSM you can we can let HSM to store

949
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:58,840
all of these crypto and also generate so

950
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,569
this is the benefit of the HSM that all

951
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,730
these crypto operations is done on on

952
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:07,390
the particular and dedicated the

953
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:11,470
hardware okay and the second question

954
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:16,810
would be what what are the efforts of

955
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:18,959
tallies towards the quantum quantum

956
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:22,180
cryptography do you do you have any

957
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,850
plans so do you do you have any roadmap

958
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:27,879
for that yeah these capabilities in the

959
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:30,279
HSM yes in terms of the quantum

960
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,830
computing you know may be better than me

961
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,990
that plenty of keys are currently not

962
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:37,660
recommended to be used for example one

963
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:40,270
kilo keys and something like that so we

964
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:43,000
approaching right now

965
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:44,890
all of our solutions are currently

966
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,960
capable to deal with the four killer

967
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:50,109
keys for the asymmetric communication

968
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,080
and also for the because we are the one

969
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:58,540
of the biggest the producer of the smart

970
00:47:53,080 --> 00:48:00,670
card chips or the cards itself so we

971
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,589
also introduce the new capabilities that

972
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:05,050
are possible to deal with the four key

973
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:06,700
low key is there so and there is the

974
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,400
expectation that for the quantum

975
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:12,250
computers will not be able to deal with

976
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:15,310
the 4 kilo keys it's it's let's say the

977
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:17,020
recent the message recent the solution

978
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:21,880
for those let's say the rumors that the

979
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:24,000
quantum computer could exist all right I

980
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:29,830
think we have time for one more question

981
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:32,890
ok let's assume that my company choose

982
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:34,359
one cloud provider let's say Amazon or

983
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:37,210
Asia it's not important

984
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:39,790
and for both storing data and

985
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,950
application running their server over

986
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:43,450
there is it's possible in some way with

987
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:46,509
this kind of solution to achieve it is

988
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:48,669
called the zero knowledge it against the

989
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,410
cloud provider I mean if I only use the

990
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,900
cloud to store the data it's trivial

991
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,569
because I can keep the key on plan I do

992
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,300
the computation on Prime and it's fine

993
00:48:55,570 --> 00:49:02,380
the cloud will never see we will never

994
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:06,010
have the chance to see the clear data

995
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:08,230
but if I also have to process those data

996
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:12,160
on the cloud at a certain point even if

997
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:15,430
I keep the key on on my key manager or a

998
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,560
third party won the the cloud provider

999
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,910
will need to have the key in order to

1000
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:22,450
use and process the data

1001
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:24,879
so is there as some way to achieve that

1002
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:29,470
in some I don't know I don't know I

1003
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:31,210
think you and yeah yeah I got it so in

1004
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,799
terms of the comparison between what is

1005
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:35,320
stored on the outside of our

1006
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,000
organization and what is stored inside

1007
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,060
of your organization the approach is

1008
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,760
pretty the same so the the differences

1009
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:46,690
are just in case of where you store the

1010
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:50,710
keys the keywords that is provided by

1011
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:53,049
the cloud providers let's say doing the

1012
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:56,709
same trick or the same

1013
00:49:53,049 --> 00:50:00,159
the task or it helps you to encrypt the

1014
00:49:56,709 --> 00:50:02,618
data as same as we are doing it but the

1015
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:05,079
differences are that we store these data

1016
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:06,609
and it's controlled by us and we can do

1017
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:09,130
for example I mentioned it during the

1018
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:12,519
presentation the rotation of the keys so

1019
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:15,279
this rotation is not let's say it is

1020
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:18,038
supported by any of the of the keyboards

1021
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:20,529
that is provided by the cloud providers

1022
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:23,229
and in terms of the layers that that you

1023
00:50:20,529 --> 00:50:25,029
apply it we have plenty of customers

1024
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:27,759
that are approaching the encryption or

1025
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:30,130
all of these levels so they started to

1026
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:33,459
encrypt the data for example on the on

1027
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:36,249
the hardware itself then on the on the

1028
00:50:33,459 --> 00:50:38,709
file level so there is other key that is

1029
00:50:36,249 --> 00:50:41,078
being responsible for the symmetric key

1030
00:50:38,709 --> 00:50:43,058
that that is encrypting those data and

1031
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:46,269
also on the application level so they

1032
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:49,689
have let's say the schizophrenic the the

1033
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:52,658
solution that they populate all of this

1034
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:54,609
data in an encrypted form so this is the

1035
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:56,679
approach that again you can apply on the

1036
00:50:54,609 --> 00:51:00,819
cloud or on the on-premise ocean as well

1037
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:02,139
so there is no differences thank you all

1038
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:05,669
right thank you very much for your

1039
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:05,669
presentation thank you
