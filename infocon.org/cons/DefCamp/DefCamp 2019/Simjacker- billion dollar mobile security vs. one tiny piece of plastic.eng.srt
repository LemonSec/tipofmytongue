1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,770
hello good morning it's morning for me -

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,240
this thing for some of the sender great

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,010
I'm not going to bore you with lots of

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,509
technical details I'm joking of course

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,599
I'm going to bore you lots of technical

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,539
details it's a it's supposed to be a

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,970
brief presentation on same technology on

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,970
SIM card technology and before we get

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,049
into it I'm going to take you on a trip

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:31,529
down memory lane

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:34,770
without any visual aid in the past 25

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,340
years also we've been moving through

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,399
generations of mobile networks and of

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,829
course two iterations of devices of

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,829
handheld devices you know mobile phones

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:51,059
smart phones cell phones

17
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:54,930
thinking back to maybe 1997 1998 with

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,660
the advent of a GSM networks maybe you

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,359
remember the you know the paradigm the

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,589
usage parroting between your stuff the

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,720
user and your handset a small handset

22
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,539
with a very simple user interaction a

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,729
very simple UI you know like just dial

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,950
the number press the green button and

25
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,880
say hello to whoever was on the other

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:22,490
line and now in 2020 we are moving

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,100
towards 5g networks with literally

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:29,189
mobile laptops in our pockets I mean my

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,339
smartphone is seriously way way powerful

30
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,770
than my laptop as with me there is one

31
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,750
thing that hasn't really changed in the

32
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,939
past 25 years when it comes to this

33
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,400
ecosystem and that thing is the SIM card

34
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:46,289
the same technology of course there's

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,020
been some modifications some additions

36
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,479
to the standards to the technology

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,520
itself but the underlying technology the

38
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,369
thing the the things that actually make

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,500
SIM cards work have been the same for

40
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:05,039
the past 20 years now moving past cell

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,920
phones and SIM cards think about the

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,349
past 20 years we've had great things

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,300
like Windows XP and the band One

44
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,170
Direction are there any fans in the

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,060
house great panel

46
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:21,458
but SIM cards are still there so pushing

47
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,740
forward to the same jackal what is it

48
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:27,459
why should we be worried about it or

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:30,010
should we be worried about it at all in

50
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,560
short it's a vulnerability in the

51
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,679
underlying technology of SIM cards it

52
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,560
has been weaponized it has been used in

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,750
some attacks as far as we know this

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,760
presentation gathered some publicly

55
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,270
available data from the likes of

56
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:50,109
advanced mobile security they published

57
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,630
some great technical papers on this it's

58
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,209
been reported to GSMA the GSM

59
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:59,200
Association and we are really waiting

60
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:01,750
for some news from them as to how this

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,470
can be fixed once and for all

62
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,840
and for the better part of it it kind of

63
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:12,670
has been patched and I'll get to that in

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:16,570
a second this is a timeline of this

65
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:20,078
specific attack starting from 2015 when

66
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:23,859
a first sighting occurred and some

67
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:25,750
people saw some weird traffic over the

68
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,130
ss7 networks and those are the networks

69
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,310
that are used for signaling and control

70
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:33,390
of the gsm networks and for a

71
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:37,090
transmission of things like SMS messages

72
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:41,078
in 2017 somebody actually intercepted a

73
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:45,730
first message a first SMS message that

74
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:48,760
was crafted in such a way that posed

75
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,548
that required for the receiving terminal

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,140
the receiving handset to do something to

77
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,709
do something that it wasn't supposed to

78
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:00,700
do when receiving an SMS in 2019 you

79
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:03,400
know June and September adapted mobile

80
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,310
security researchers submitted the

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,950
vulnerability to GSM a and you know in

82
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:12,010
September some high-level info was

83
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,078
released on this it's not on this slide

84
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,820
but in October I think in mid-october or

85
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,640
so advanced mobile security actually

86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,010
published a technical paper in some

87
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,579
greater detail on the specific

88
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,579
vulnerability

89
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:29,330
this is a sim card well this is not

90
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,940
literally a sim card this is an LED

91
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,409
screen this is a graphic representation

92
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,319
of a sink of the logical presentation a

93
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:39,430
sim card in itself it's an Java applet a

94
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,100
top on top of a smart card

95
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,250
this is what you now have in your cell

96
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,050
phone you have like this very very under

97
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,840
power low-power computer as Mark called

98
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:56,139
running something like 1890 CBS CPU

99
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,840
using six to eight kilobytes of RAM and

100
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:03,280
then on top of it you have Java card

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:06,400
which is like java's they look backwards

102
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,030
cousin and on top of that you have some

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,210
apps one of those apps

104
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,190
it's the SIM card app the thing that

105
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,770
actually allows you to authenticate in

106
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,719
in the network of your provider and to

107
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,060
exchange information such as your cell

108
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:28,960
phone number your NCI and SMS messages

109
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,750
well the same app leverages the use of

110
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,630
an API the sim toolkit API to

111
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,820
communicate to well the baseband of your

112
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,710
cell phone you not to initiate calls and

113
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,340
to answer calls and to send SMS messages

114
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:46,510
and to an user interface you may have

115
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:49,539
seen this in things like a SIM card

116
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,719
applications on your cell phone or on

117
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:55,740
your smartphone it has been used in

118
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:00,669
Romania as far as I can tell by some

119
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:03,310
operators in the past 20 years around

120
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:06,669
maybe meet two thousand three thousand

121
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,460
five up to until 2010 this was actually

122
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:15,010
a thing you could have recharged your

123
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:19,650
prepaid SIM card account from menu like

124
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,650
this from an interface like this well

125
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:31,789
over that javacard operating system

126
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:35,300
in your CMAP in your scene applets we

127
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:38,000
have two instances that are been that

128
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,630
have been used to weaponize the 6.0 this

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,060
one arabic you have a SAT browser the

130
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,130
sim Alliance toolkit browser which is

131
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,080
the thing that actually communicates to

132
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,050
the UI of a phone and allows you to

133
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:55,310
select things as download ringtones or

134
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,139
pay the electricity bill and you have

135
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,120
the wireless internet browser this is a

136
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:01,130
different implementation it's kind of

137
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,090
the SAT browser on steroids

138
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:08,810
it actually has it's an implementation

139
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:11,409
of a WAP browser you remember what yeah

140
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:15,759
that was great that that's a good thing

141
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:17,360
of course those two apps are vulnerable

142
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,310
well go figure

143
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,840
there are twenty years old or so and

144
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:26,539
they are vulnerable to to an Mis

145
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,580
configuration actually when sending an

146
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:38,120
SMS over the over the air to a handset

147
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:40,490
to a SIM card in this instance the

148
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,130
operator can actually push the

149
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,770
information they are going to send to

150
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:48,199
you the end-user to different type of

151
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,599
messages you have administrative level

152
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,440
messages which can say to the cell phone

153
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:58,969
do this or that dial a number or I don't

154
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,590
know recharge the credit of your prepaid

155
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:04,909
card with five euros or stuff like that

156
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:07,758
and then you have lower priority

157
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:11,330
messages that can of course transport

158
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,270
things like 80 commands or even exploit

159
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,139
the vulnerabilities that we're

160
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:21,258
discussing and these messages have a

161
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:25,270
minimum security level it's pretty much

162
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,270
like everything in YP

163
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:32,718
the the 3gpp standard that scrutinizes

164
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,490
this and imposes a certain level of

165
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,979
security for certain type of messages

166
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,990
it's not that clear as to the required

167
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,060
minimum security level for two type of

168
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,380
messages high priority push and low

169
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:49,630
priority push messages and these are

170
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,850
binary SMS ease

171
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:56,300
SMS messages that can be pushed can be

172
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:59,570
sent to a victim's cell phone victim's

173
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,310
number and can get that number to do

174
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,080
something get that handset to do

175
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,900
something because in the previous slide

176
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,880
I'll show you that this these applets

177
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,390
have direct access to the basement of

178
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,030
the cell phone they simply forgot or

179
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:17,110
maybe they weren't thinking it that

180
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:19,579
clearly when to when they imposed a

181
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,990
minimum security level for for the

182
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,080
messages that can be pushed over there

183
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,060
so just keep in mind that the low

184
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
priority push push messages and high

185
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,930
priority push messages that can be sent

186
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,569
about here have no requirements as to a

187
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,880
minimum security level basic things like

188
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,240
some form of encryption so form of

189
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,640
authentication if you are on the

190
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,520
receiving end anything can be sent over

191
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:48,410
there well

192
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,370
this lights pretty much summarizes what

193
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:54,620
I said in the past two minutes but the

194
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:58,430
thing that I'm going to insist on is

195
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,310
that the SAT browser will accept push

196
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:04,370
messages without any security level

197
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,680
requirement that's the technologies

198
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,790
that's the underlying technology that's

199
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:17,020
the standard the attack the things that

200
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:20,930
we saw in 2017 and then in 2018 I think

201
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,210
well one crafty decimas it's sent over

202
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:27,530
the air too

203
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:30,740
well the victims the SMS is a binary one

204
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,860
as opposed to your run-of-the-mill your

205
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,870
your regular SMS message which is pretty

206
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,930
much text I'm not going to go into

207
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,230
encoding but yes you have like 140 bytes

208
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:45,650
for first four texts this binary message

209
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,270
is usually sent by mobile network

210
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,970
operators operators by cell phone

211
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:53,150
operators the cellular network operators

212
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,960
to their subscribers do things like

213
00:10:53,150 --> 00:11:00,500
configure the cell phone when in roaming

214
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:02,510
to push some kind of configuration for

215
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:07,460
some network changes in a geographical

216
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:09,980
area on the administrative side so you a

217
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,960
regular user of a cell phone shouldn't

218
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,960
be bothered with this but these messages

219
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,670
do exist they have been used they are in

220
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,590
use actually in using some parts of the

221
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,280
of the world I'm going to get into that

222
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,340
a bit later

223
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,370
and they are the principle vector for

224
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,320
this attack the message contains a

225
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,260
payload of instructions crafted to

226
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:35,110
interact with the SAT browser app and

227
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:38,930
the sim toolkit on that single step -

228
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,100
once the instructions are are receiving

229
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,760
on the SIM card they are of course

230
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,000
executed

231
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,210
and the instructions themselves can be

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,080
pretty much anything you can go high

233
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:55,230
level and ask for things like cell ID

234
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:57,690
location information right and IME the

235
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,600
IME of the handset what can go deeper

236
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:03,270
you can actually run 80 commands like on

237
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,120
a modem do remember models 80 models

238
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,819
yeah those are great ancient technology

239
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,370
as well

240
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,860
moreover the wireless internet browser

241
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,510
the the other implementation of the SAT

242
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:22,140
browsers are the most the more modern

243
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:24,960
one could be can be used to open a web

244
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:27,600
page in the default browser of the phone

245
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,040
although what browser are embedded on

246
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:35,100
that SIM card you can actually push

247
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:38,250
commands such as dial a number or send

248
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:45,020
an SMS message to a different number

249
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:48,870
through this binary messages and step 3

250
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:53,600
the binary SMS that contains the command

251
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:57,270
for gate location ID and get I am II

252
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,700
execute the payload and then instructs

253
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:02,550
the cell phone to exfiltrate the

254
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,570
information to a different number so the

255
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:08,699
attacker is on one side of the victim in

256
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,620
the network and the receiving number

257
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,900
which is probably owned by the attacker

258
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,020
is on the other side so in this full

259
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,630
cycle you get from your unsuspecting

260
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,880
victim you know the gist uses his his or

261
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:24,810
her cell phone and the bad guys that

262
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,130
sending binary messages to the cell

263
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,770
phone and then the cell phone itself

264
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:33,800
will push the location and the EMI of

265
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:36,810
the handset to another to another number

266
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,430
the actual attack that was observed in

267
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:45,949
the wild focused on some regions in in

268
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:49,770
South America I think it is Mexico and

269
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,450
in some parts of Colombia and Peru there

270
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,710
have been over ten thousand subscribers

271
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:59,400
that were monitored for location

272
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:03,000
and handset information over time span

273
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:06,240
of maybe two years there hasn't been any

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,980
attribution as to who what the attacker

275
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,910
who are the attackers and I'm not

276
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,280
definitely not going to go into that but

277
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:16,800
there there has been some forensic work

278
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,010
there have been some artifacts that

279
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,479
remain post-attack because there's

280
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,689
knowledge that the attackers actually

281
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,420
used the ss7 Network so they were kind

282
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:34,920
of inside inside the mobile operator

283
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:37,500
Network for that attack and as far as we

284
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,449
know regarding that billion-dollar

285
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,780
security versus the tiny pieces of

286
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:45,690
plastic the attackers tried a number of

287
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:48,020
things and I've broken down some of the

288
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:52,860
things into three different scenarios

289
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:57,540
location tracking I believe that most of

290
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:59,760
you are somehow you know paying

291
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,520
attention as to when their cell phone

292
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,069
was asked for asks for location you

293
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,050
disable services like location services

294
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,330
when they are not needed you tell

295
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:13,439
different applications not to track your

296
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:16,620
precise just data just for the hell of

297
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,410
it well that's one layer of security of

298
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,060
course you might be using something like

299
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,060
a VPN tunnel from your handset your

300
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,130
mobile device your work network you have

301
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,239
strong encryption there because I don't

302
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,990
know maybe it's a mobile device

303
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,120
management policy you might be using an

304
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,540
T tracking browsers and things like that

305
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,310
you might be you know like a black belt

306
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,530
of cybersecurity when it comes to your

307
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,989
mobile phone all the boxes are ticked

308
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,550
you are doing everything right there's

309
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,520
nothing more than you can do to be safe

310
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,870
and to ensure that hackers won't be

311
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,550
hacking you won't be tracking the

312
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,900
location your location for example and

313
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:57,420
then you know somebody pushes an OT over

314
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,180
the year OTA SMS message to your cell

315
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,839
phone and gets your location ID your

316
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,310
cell ID and your IME your handset and

317
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,260
sometimes then

318
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:13,020
they can you know they can do something

319
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:15,510
basic such as mapping the the cell ID

320
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,160
data to Jesus location on a map using

321
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,750
something like open cell ID they even

322
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,360
have an epi API for that and it's free

323
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,950
you don't have to pay nothing and then

324
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,350
they can use something like open map and

325
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,030
the time stamps from the messages to

326
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,260
visually track your location on a map

327
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:34,199
this is one scenario as as far as

328
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:37,380
research goes it has been used for the

329
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,440
victims in South America another

330
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,870
scenario fraud as I said before we can

331
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,180
push something over the air and convince

332
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,740
you know that cell phone of yours then

333
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,719
it's a good idea to actually dial up a

334
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:55,710
number any number may be a special rate

335
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,980
number somewhere in a special rate

336
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,810
number allowed place you know you know

337
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,170
those numbers maybe you got some calls

338
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:07,020
from various numbers in various islands

339
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:09,449
from the Indian Ocean and you call them

340
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,819
back and the mobile network operators

341
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,000
calls you up and say hey you know that's

342
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:17,790
a special rate number and you always

343
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,180
much euros well that's one application

344
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:25,980
of this attack and there's one thing

345
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:29,100
that stands above as when it comes to

346
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,200
this kind of attack it seemed chakra

347
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,899
based attack everything it's done under

348
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,040
the cover there's no user interaction

349
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,350
whatsoever

350
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:42,070
it's the way that the sim card actually

351
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:44,949
works you can push that that applet that

352
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:48,129
applet that allows your phone to dial a

353
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,980
number and you can instruct that card

354
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:54,370
because it's a Java card application to

355
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,700
work in sort of a silent mode you know

356
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:01,840
no usually interaction or whatsoever and

357
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:04,179
then you can go as far as deploy mod

358
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,720
welcome from a distance from a safe

359
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:07,840
distance

360
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:13,090
this is a bit far-fetched but bear with

361
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,909
me you get your Eni from a mobile from

362
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:18,610
the SMS message you get the handset

363
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:22,030
vendor you get the model it's an

364
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:24,428
educated guess from there on to search

365
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:27,040
for something client-side a

366
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:29,049
vulnerability in one of the apps let's

367
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,570
say it's an Android phone let's say it's

368
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:33,309
an outdated 200 phone let's say it's an

369
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,860
outdated Android found that the vendor

370
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:39,490
doesn't actually want to update let's

371
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:42,639
say it had some form of it had some

372
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:45,400
applications embedded by the mobile

373
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,980
network operator there's some

374
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,200
client-side thing going on there you

375
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,390
craft your exploit you put your exploit

376
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,610
somewhere on the web you send an SMS

377
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,890
message did that phone number and

378
00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:00,570
instruct the wireless internet browser

379
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:04,030
to open that web page and to execute the

380
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,889
client-side thing and then you know you

381
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,080
have access in that program in that cell

382
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:11,320
phone this is a bit far-fetched but as

383
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:16,030
far as as far as I know it has been

384
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,409
tried I'm not going to I'm not going to

385
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,260
talk about the success of such an

386
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:24,790
endeavor but it's it's worth thinking

387
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:28,780
about it so this brings us to the last

388
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:30,879
part of of this presentation and the the

389
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,360
the the question that's supposed to be

390
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,280
open then I'm going to give you the both

391
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,350
versions of the answer so we can close

392
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:44,408
it should we be worried no you should

393
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:49,279
not really here on the on the map I've

394
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:55,139
overlaid in red the the countries where

395
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:57,239
such an attack is possible because in

396
00:19:55,139 --> 00:20:01,049
those countries there are mobile network

397
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:04,169
operators that are using versions of SIM

398
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:07,320
cards there that are actually vulnerable

399
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:09,269
to this they use that wireless internet

400
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,559
browser and that SAT browser the

401
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:16,320
technology that application or you know

402
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:19,470
they don't have any kind of binary SMS

403
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,220
firewall in place between the in the

404
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:25,109
core network Romania isn't one of those

405
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,639
countries I know that this is an

406
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:28,609
international audience I really hope

407
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:32,519
you're not in in red in the red there

408
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:35,249
but you shouldn't actually be worried

409
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:38,269
about this as an attack I don't think it

410
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:43,409
they are going to target any of us here

411
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:47,879
but what you really worried us is that

412
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:51,299
that vulnerability is was found in

413
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:55,738
ancient technology and this goes to

414
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:58,799
prove that all the things you know all

415
00:20:55,739 --> 00:21:01,499
things that are in use I'm an old thing

416
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:07,099
that news are vulnerable to being

417
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:09,450
obsolete we don't pay great attention to

418
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,158
technologies that are just there are

419
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,169
just sitting there and SIM card it's

420
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,729
such a technology and it's going to be

421
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:16,349
there is going to be in your 5g phone

422
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:17,849
it's definitely going to be in your 5g

423
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:21,090
phone it's probably going to be in your

424
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:25,229
6g phone it's it's still used for the

425
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,928
same basic basic things that it has been

426
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:28,889
used for the past 20 years or so

427
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,099
authenticating that the phone the

428
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:34,080
handset to the mobile network and just

429
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:39,178
you know pushing things like cell phone

430
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:42,749
numbers and SMS messages the technology

431
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:45,779
that the technological depth as some of

432
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:53,039
us call it it's not something that we

433
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:56,609
can necessarily fix with software or

434
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,820
with hardware or with binary SMS

435
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:03,020
firewalls or with improved SIM cards

436
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,850
from vendors that are not using those

437
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,460
Java applets on top of the technology

438
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,770
it's something that requires constant

439
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,310
constant attention it's something that

440
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,840
requires some of us going very very deep

441
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:18,980
in the technological layers that

442
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,889
actually make up this entire entire

443
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:25,280
technology field and the third

444
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:27,410
communication is just one such one such

445
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,010
area where we should pay attention to

446
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,850
this so in my belief at least yes we

447
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,830
should be worried

448
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:38,270
to some extent not necessarily about sin

449
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:42,470
jacking it's ok but probably because of

450
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:45,170
the thing that in maybe three years or

451
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:48,680
four years or five years somebody will

452
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:50,510
be discussing about the next all thing

453
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,590
that has been hacked in a conference

454
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:57,230
just like this so being a bit more

455
00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:00,889
proactive in the way we design security

456
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:03,260
for obsolete technology it's probably

457
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:08,390
the best thing we can do to actually

458
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:09,770
secure that technology and finally there

459
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,110
are some acknowledgments for this

460
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,790
there's been lots of data from our

461
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,219
adaptive mobile security from the

462
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,170
technical papers great read I'd really

463
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:22,010
recommend you go to it if you are into

464
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:25,100
this kind of old tech stuff I think we

465
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:32,350
have time for some questions I don't

466
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:32,350
know we have one here in the front

467
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:47,900
yes but yes you know like little what do

468
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:52,610
you call it the asterisks there are some

469
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,810
vendors that are still using the Java

470
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,379
applets I've mentioned before the one

471
00:23:53,810 --> 00:24:00,909
the ones that are available as far as I

472
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,800
know those vendors are being used in

473
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:06,440
very very small geographical areas by

474
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:10,159
very small mobile network operators you

475
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,680
know so on a larger scale you shouldn't

476
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,380
be worried about that and assume it's in

477
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,700
fact just your average SIM card in a

478
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:25,429
different form factor

479
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:27,139
okay so that expression okay let's let's

480
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:33,350
pick someone here on this side this side

481
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:35,600
oh yeah thank you

482
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:38,509
as we all know today more and more of us

483
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,488
are using our mobile phones as a means

484
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:46,129
to factor authentication on various

485
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:50,359
platforms which is something that my or

486
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:53,109
is secure my question is is it really

487
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:56,269
because recently there have been

488
00:24:53,109 --> 00:25:00,168
problems with sim cloning if I'm correct

489
00:24:56,269 --> 00:25:02,119
which could allow overriding the legit

490
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:04,820
two-factor authentication and deliver

491
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:09,408
the power to the attacker to impersonate

492
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:11,239
you and gain control on some platforms

493
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:14,509
which require at the second layer of

494
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:17,769
authentication we know that this is

495
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:22,309
possible because it has been done before

496
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:24,619
my question is how can is how can it be

497
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:27,678
possible and how can we protect against

498
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:29,720
it that's a good question and this is

499
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,149
going to be some somewhat of a long

500
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,369
answer one of the use case is one of the

501
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:36,229
scenarios that have been tested

502
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:37,730
regarding the syndicate vulnerability

503
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,789
and this ninja attack but I have not

504
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:45,679
presented that in this PowerPoint is is

505
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:49,340
that an SMS spoofing in this case one

506
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,220
attacker can use his own SMS centers and

507
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,049
that's like really old technology that

508
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,970
sits somewhere in the core network of a

509
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:59,090
mobile network in another cooperator and

510
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:02,799
actually pushes forward this it forwards

511
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:05,629
SMS messages from sender to destination

512
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,450
using this somebody could actually use

513
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:11,689
their own SMS Center and then push

514
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:15,320
messages that are destined that you

515
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:18,769
should receive from your bank like a

516
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,990
second factor to their own their own

517
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:25,510
numbers there are no phone numbers

518
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,790
given the complexity of such an endeavor

519
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:31,120
to secure two factor authentication over

520
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:33,190
SMS I think we should have a whole

521
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,530
difference on the entire conference just

522
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:39,490
on this but we should start maybe for

523
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:41,860
mobile security from this and I'm going

524
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,140
to say it again we are safe this doesn't

525
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:48,490
necessarily concern us the same Joker

526
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:51,280
attack and push forward to you know

527
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,100
using something better it is my belief

528
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,860
regarding two-factor over SMS that it

529
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:02,980
should go into the technological depth

530
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:05,889
pile and be used you know as as as

531
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:07,930
little as possible and may be used just

532
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:11,080
for things that are not really important

533
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,850
or at least you know can be considered

534
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,649
not really important for things that are

535
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,370
critical we should move past that I

536
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:20,290
think this could be a catch-all answer

537
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:23,790
thank you thank you so much you want

538
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,790
let's give him a big round of applause
