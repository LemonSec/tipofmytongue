1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:13,799
okay you're still alive that was not the

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:17,310
right answer he's still alive okay great

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,070
as I mentioned I'm Ellen Gobber I know

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,869
that GABA means cops in a bad way in

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,029
Romanian right yeah I know so I was

6
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,519
developer once now I am and pen tester I

7
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,210
run small come up a pen testing company

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,660
from Slovenia I'm also besides Ljubljana

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,120
founder so if you're somewhere around

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,429
April next year some very close to

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,110
Slovenia you're more than welcome to

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:50,309
join and tell me I can tell you a little

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:56,480
bit secret about the death camp you know

14
00:00:50,309 --> 00:01:04,289
has anybody been at the third death camp

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:06,929
third 2012 I've been and you know what

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,240
the death camp was my first

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,010
international conference as a presenter

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,130
I decided to go you know I decided to go

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,549
to Romania and if I fail it's better to

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,250
fail in the Romania but you know what

21
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,780
after that

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,450
these are location I present it all

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,090
around all around the world so you see

24
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,640
it's possible so it's also deaf camp has

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,020
a really good good opportunity to start

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,210
as a presenter okay what's it going to

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,229
be agenda since I have plenty of slides

28
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,939
and I have also live demos that probably

29
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:46,770
will go wrong because I didn't pray to

30
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,500
the demo gods yesterday because

31
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,130
yesterday I was still in Dublin doing

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,780
presentations at noon so just doing a

33
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,390
presentation running on a plane

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,820
getting here to present it here ok we

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,070
will shortly go through the hit devices

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,199
what kind of tools what kind of

37
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,279
scenarios and you will see that there is

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,470
a plenty of things going on

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,830
ok do I need to explain what hit device

40
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:18,900
is probably no but

41
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:22,290
we are talking we all devices we really

42
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,350
like to be keyboards why because with

43
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:29,489
keyboards you can input some strings but

44
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:32,460
normally it can be also Mouse's game

45
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:36,200
controllers clickers see this one that

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:39,090
everybody is using it it's it can type

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,280
no it cannot only click it can type I

48
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,660
wanted to show you a demo but problem is

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,330
with the clickers because they're kind

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,670
of slow so we won't be showing it but

51
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,430
trust me this can type it can type

52
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,280
whatever you want there are medical

53
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,620
devices and actually he advises any

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,450
device that meets his specification so

55
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,900
this is also one kind of the device

56
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,690
which it behaves as a keyboard and if we

57
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,650
go through the little bit back to the

58
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:10,290
future we seen different kind of devices

59
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,930
this is from 2011 which is quite

60
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,269
expensive you know which can be used as

61
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,520
a keyboard the second one which is more

62
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,700
even more expensive and also it looks

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,570
like a cable but it's not the cable so

64
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,329
actually here device if you have $200

65
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,609
it's worth it then you have different

66
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,780
devices which are really really cheap so

67
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,209
like three three dollars and you can run

68
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,720
scripts on it but the problem is because

69
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,370
they are not worried let's say well

70
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,700
design so it's hard to stick them in a

71
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,550
cable it's really easy to weaponize it

72
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,290
with this you own the machine so you

73
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,190
just run some kind of PowerShell and

74
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,410
that's it well then last year

75
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,570
look um when Germany created really nice

76
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,940
tool which is something like this

77
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,799
actually it is this you know so it looks

78
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,680
like USB key and it's not USB key

79
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,160
actually he managed to Mary Hitt device

80
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,220
and the Wi-Fi so you don't have to be

81
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,739
near so you can just plug the USB key in

82
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,070
and you can over the Wi-Fi send the

83
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,410
commands it's really nice built it's a

84
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,440
little bit about five fifteen fifteen

85
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,860
dollars and it really works for example

86
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,600
this one is weaponized in a manner so if

87
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,330
I take this USB

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,480
into your computer your Wi-Fi passwords

89
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,760
that are stored in your Windows Store

90
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,670
your Wi-Fi passwords goals with me how

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,740
we will explain a little bit later so

92
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:43,620
this year he created even more

93
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,660
sophisticated tool because otherwise if

94
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,960
you have the Wi-Fi you have to be near

95
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:53,460
this we we hit delete it just it was

96
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,380
just released it has GSM modem so you

97
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,989
can actually control it over the GSM

98
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,930
networks so you just plug it in and you

99
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,150
have the keyboard remotely accessed so

100
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,090
you might get some other ideas how to

101
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,940
use it what are the normals attack

102
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,099
scenarios probably just dropping USB

103
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,570
sticks you know with the palos different

104
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,850
kind of play loads with the powershell

105
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,550
powershell portion still today very

106
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,010
popular or you can use some other tools

107
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,590
to download malicious files like 32 bits

108
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:26,930
min which are found on every Windows

109
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:30,750
machine or this is not only a keyboard

110
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:32,610
because these devices can have multiple

111
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,710
personalities what does this mean it can

112
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:40,920
behave like a keyboard like a mouse

113
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:43,320
thumb drive or like a serial port so

114
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,590
with this one you can actually extract

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,870
over the serial port all files from the

116
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:52,200
from the desktop and this one is

117
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:56,700
actually using comport to exfiltrate the

118
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,170
Wi-Fi passwords as I said we have it it

119
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,490
actually you need to be close for the

120
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:06,630
via Wi-Fi limits okay then we had in

121
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:09,870
2016 now who remembers Mouse Jack okay

122
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,719
one two three you know every big issues

123
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:16,290
they have kind of they get the kind of

124
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,370
logo of issues now and what we found out

125
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,650
that still since 2016 there is a tool

126
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,830
called jacket so you can actually inject

127
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,630
yourself into non-secured non encrypted

128
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,659
communication between the dongle and the

129
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,060
mouse and there is still a huge number

130
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,220
of devices that are actually still

131
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,450
weren't able to this why we will get a

132
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,950
little bit later why is this is still so

133
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:46,000
so how was weather here in

134
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:48,969
how was summer hard okay it's what's not

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,550
hot only here but also regarding the

136
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:56,320
CVEs

137
00:06:50,550 --> 00:07:03,490
does somebody recognize those TVs yes

138
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:06,969
all of them anybody else we have one guy

139
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:11,650
who is recognized what's dcve sirs but

140
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:17,050
lets me try to put rephrase my question

141
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:19,780
I guess you know this company okay you

142
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:24,760
know that company right who's using

143
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,840
Logitech products not anymore not

144
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,240
anymore yeah

145
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,190
and the biggest problem was this you

146
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,920
know the logitech with this little

147
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,230
orange yellow orange sign you know like

148
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,560
unifying unifying connector so you can

149
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:43,000
connect to one or one receiver multiple

150
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,430
multiple devices so these TVs are

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,670
actually all series are connected with

152
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,710
Logitech issues so as you've seen the

153
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,010
first one is a s key sniffing from

154
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:56,830
pairing so what does this mean so if

155
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:58,630
somebody listens and it's actually close

156
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,930
to you when you are pairing your device

157
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:04,120
he can get the a s key and what does

158
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:08,290
this mean he can actually intercept and

159
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,820
modify or send or decrypt if it's a

160
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,260
keyboard actually decrypt all the

161
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:16,270
communication between your key your

162
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:18,490
keyboard and your computer possibility

163
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:21,039
to injection Keys dump from USB from

164
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,170
presentation clickers so from this kind

165
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,670
of devices majority of them they are

166
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:29,950
still vulnerable and also because when

167
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:34,810
is the last time you updated firmware on

168
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:36,250
your on your receiver on your disk when

169
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:42,789
was the last time you updated firmware

170
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:45,730
here huh the guy stopped using it you

171
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,550
know that was the maybe the best best

172
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,860
solution and also they found to some

173
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,750
other issues like he dumped so the

174
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,480
problem is also with this this little

175
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,750
bit this device if

176
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,480
somebody gets your hands on it and it's

177
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,899
still vulnerable he can dump your keys

178
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,149
so it just plugs in dumps the keys put

179
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,920
it back in and all ink

180
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:09,810
you know you lose all encryption between

181
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,920
your key between your keyboard and your

182
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,699
computer okay this what's I gonna show

183
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,370
you next

184
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:19,680
this is not our research last three

185
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,449
three visits to deaf camp we were

186
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,089
showing our research but this is the

187
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:26,099
actually research that was doing done by

188
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:29,850
others but we let's say continue

189
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,519
contributed a little bit first of all

190
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,920
they have been two different kind of

191
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,019
let's say researchers who were searching

192
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,240
in the same area the first one they

193
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:42,209
presented in June at confidence in

194
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,810
Poland and they present it also again on

195
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:47,729
October 29 at a clue so if you want to

196
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,459
see what's actually they are going into

197
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:53,639
little real technical details about it

198
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:56,459
you can see the the the presentation so

199
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,889
online already but we will be talking

200
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:03,359
about this guy who actually made really

201
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:08,240
really that's a great software I don't

202
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:13,589
know who is using pound pie pound by

203
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:17,100
you're not Marcus right you would like

204
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:19,019
to be yes but not okay he's really great

205
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,560
researcher and great person with some

206
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:25,920
really crazy crazy ideas and he also

207
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,279
proposed for the black hat talk but he

208
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,260
was rejected and I really think that was

209
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,610
a big mistake from the black hat

210
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:38,189
committee because he would have really

211
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:41,279
something some really nice things to

212
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,680
show and after that you know when we

213
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,260
started talking with him he said like I

214
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,790
since this is a big issue because almost

215
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:53,639
everybody is using Wi-Fi Wi-Fi and

216
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,050
Logitech Logitech devices you know he

217
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,579
really wanted to brought an shin

218
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,819
security community and make customers

219
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:02,699
aware so he said like here you know have

220
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:04,620
it play with it and go and talk about it

221
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:07,170
because he cannot go to all the

222
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,060
conferences around the world so he's

223
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,660
actually the

224
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:13,699
of log attacker so it's kind of not only

225
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,100
a software it's kind of combination it's

226
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,370
a hardware tool to enumerate so it's

227
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,860
actually his software it's running on

228
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:24,110
let me see if I can plug it's on on this

229
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,450
one you know with the mouse Jack before

230
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,960
we had to have program running on our

231
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:33,140
computer and using like Nordic or nordic

232
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,930
hardware to to be able to inject

233
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,910
ourselves but with this one everything

234
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,500
is combined so the software is actually

235
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,339
running here so you only need to have

236
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:45,400
like I don't know pooty or screen

237
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,300
connecting to it and you can have

238
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,280
everything running here so you don't

239
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,319
have to need you don't have to install

240
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:56,660
any additional software on your machine

241
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,390
there's plenty of logitech ER features

242
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,339
which are which are available from

243
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,319
discovering so you're gonna see when i'm

244
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,110
gonna be running in life you're gonna

245
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,120
see that because this device has

246
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:12,890
antennae so you will see probably

247
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:16,130
somewhere also as we measured from 30 to

248
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,960
50 meters so if somebody is using mouse

249
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,930
somewhere there you still get the

250
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,960
packets so you can still in listen or

251
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,540
inject yourself into it so you have the

252
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:30,080
key pairing so you can stay for the

253
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,819
keepers you get the AES key you can save

254
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,880
it you can save this you can write the

255
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,980
script it's really it's really awesome

256
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,000
and you have the releases for different

257
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,550
kind of devices on his github if you

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,860
want to play with it there are four

259
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:49,699
different boards that supports a log

260
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:53,960
attacker the first one it's Nordic which

261
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,090
costs about thirty thirty dollars but

262
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,430
it's really nice because you can you

263
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,170
know you can stuck it because it's

264
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,319
really designed you can stuck it in like

265
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,939
USB key which looks like this now I took

266
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,730
this from one of the Slovenian

267
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:12,440
conferences you know took it apart and

268
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,270
put it in this Nordic Nordic board then

269
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,100
you have maker diary rivet two different

270
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,970
dongles one is with the possibility of

271
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,820
CERN Altana

272
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,899
and I will be playing with this April

273
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,930
brother

274
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:28,339
which is I say less expensive but it's

275
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:32,420
quality is also from five or four

276
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:35,690
purchased only one it's working working

277
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:40,189
now at the moment so these are the hard

278
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:42,769
words so if you let's say if you spot

279
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,630
that somebody is using kind of antennas

280
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:49,100
something like this you know it might be

281
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:51,980
getting real really suspicious like deer

282
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,100
like here but you can get really really

283
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,670
long range so as I said from 30 to 50

284
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,860
meters what does this mean if you manage

285
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:04,760
let's say to get to the close to the

286
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:08,870
some potential I don't know company that

287
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,939
you're attacking of course with with

288
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,720
authorization do it so you can get it

289
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:17,209
from the parking lot let's say the

290
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,940
traffic that is going on that is going

291
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:22,369
through with these two boards they don't

292
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,350
have antennae so their limit they're

293
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,750
kind of limited so if you're in the same

294
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:31,069
room then this would be probably

295
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:34,880
possible has anybody been walking

296
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:38,959
through the CDF arena did anybody check

297
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,880
did they have Logitech mouse on it you

298
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,680
might get crazy ideas you know if you're

299
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,480
some other team you know my you might be

300
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,000
messing with their inputs you know and

301
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,180
typing and stuff and I checked there are

302
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,709
some Logitech Mouse's used her and I

303
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,888
don't know I didn't check if their

304
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:56,810
firmware is updated and there's a third

305
00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:00,889
device a little bit bigger but it also

306
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:03,199
has possibility to external antenna also

307
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:06,019
this this device is there not only one

308
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,300
device it's actually it's a combination

309
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:10,670
of four devices one is used for there's

310
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,620
a serial port the other one is used

311
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,899
wallak it can be used as a mouse so you

312
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,569
can actually replay what does this mean

313
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:20,329
so if somebody if you managed to get the

314
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:23,360
keys or he's using let's say non

315
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:28,239
encrypted communication and he's let's

316
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:31,069
say you transfer you you sniff there

317
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,280
let's say mouse movement actually your

318
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:36,260
mouse moves so as he moves your mouse

319
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,670
and the same with the keyboard so

320
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,610
everything that he's typing on his

321
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:44,479
keyboard and you can listen to it you

322
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,850
can get all the keyboard that are

323
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,500
pressing and also definitely the raw

324
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,260
devices so everything that is getting

325
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,140
and this is the road device that we used

326
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,360
so if we can actually decode we managed

327
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,620
to write some tools for Windows they can

328
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,720
actually store and manage the key logger

329
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,390
so Logitech err - actually covers these

330
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,700
different kind of vulnerabilities the

331
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,140
old one that's are from 2016 this is

332
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,880
plane injection so if there is no

333
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,010
encryption

334
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:16,810
who knows if your mouse is are using

335
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:26,660
some kind of Krypton who can let's say

336
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:33,709
say that my mouse uses encryption what

337
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:35,719
your why yeah kind of yeah yeah but if

338
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,670
somebody sticks to USB sniffer then it's

339
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,790
a problem but yes it's comes definitely

340
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,459
and I've seen a lot of white Moses at

341
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,540
the CTF area so I guess they know why

342
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,910
but and there are some other

343
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:52,339
vulnerabilities that's actually Logitech

344
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,170
covers okay since I have only thirty

345
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,420
minutes you know I've been running

346
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,689
really fast and I don't want to be late

347
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,110
let's go to the demo so as I said we

348
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:08,000
have here this device that's actually

349
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:11,599
dongle updated with with Marcus firmware

350
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,740
and now if we just try to see what's

351
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:20,419
actually going on let's see if this

352
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:23,150
connects so now there's it looks like

353
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:26,270
you turn off all your mice mices so

354
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,780
because there is no no traffic no but

355
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:34,670
there is inai as I move my mouse you

356
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:37,370
don't see anything almost yeah I change

357
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:41,950
the font it will take a long but lets me

358
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:45,320
see if I can do I can do this better a

359
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:47,600
little bit let's see this but you see as

360
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,290
I move my mouse you see that it's

361
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,870
actually

362
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:54,050
so if the guy from the video you have

363
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:57,229
also wireless mouse no too bad

364
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:59,770
wireless mouse no on the court we will

365
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,870
probably see I've been sitting in of

366
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:05,990
near the CTF there is a plenty of

367
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:09,590
movement there so as you see we have

368
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:13,580
seen all the devices and how many

369
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:15,550
devices we see here it's only the let's

370
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,620
say fault

371
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:21,379
devices so we see here that we have

372
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:25,219
somewhere near here about four devices

373
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:28,100
one is mine how do I know because I

374
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,470
already was playing before and I see you

375
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:34,669
see that I already have the key so I can

376
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:38,200
let's say inject or listen to to do

377
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:41,480
everything that my my mouse is doing

378
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,180
okay so that's the first but we can

379
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,250
definitely store this you see devices we

380
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,410
can store it and we are storing this on

381
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,900
this device so if you plug it to a some

382
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,850
other computer you will have the same

383
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,830
same keys and same devices in same

384
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,500
scripts because you can also write the

385
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,360
script so if you you can write a script

386
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,710
if some device is found you can actually

387
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,990
start poking around with it okay now

388
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,020
let's try to inject ourselves into the

389
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:12,680
communication one short question what do

390
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:15,889
you think in this type how do you type

391
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:20,800
this how do you type a on your keyboard

392
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,800
on your machine with this hmm

393
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:27,080
left click right click but can somebody

394
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,429
try okay I have a virtual machine here

395
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,120
let's do it to challenge let's do a

396
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:35,600
challenge let's do a challenge okay you

397
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,969
see this dongle is connected to here so

398
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,139
to this virtual machine so see it's only

399
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:46,570
running here so how challenge for you

400
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:53,380
how can you type a with that draw it

401
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:57,460
draw it yeah but now really using

402
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,460
virtual Cree keyboard yeah

403
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:07,769
you try you have five seconds so use it

404
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:09,629
okay five seconds five four three two

405
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:12,519
one

406
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:15,519
well you cannot do it you know but let

407
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:17,469
me try I get my mouse back I lost

408
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:22,539
someone already at the Sun presentation

409
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:27,339
so let's write with simple let's write

410
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:28,749
it simple let's say a script load so

411
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:32,950
this is kind of script it's actually

412
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:34,749
saved already here I will load it I will

413
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,169
select the target and I will try to

414
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:41,769
execute this script I can show later

415
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:44,349
what's actually doing but let's see see

416
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:47,289
mouse is actually active here so in this

417
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:51,189
area that Mouse it's connected over the

418
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:54,820
VMware with virtual yeah see if this one

419
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:59,169
will be working since the live demos

420
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:01,269
normally don't go really well but let's

421
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:06,909
see if this one will write something to

422
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:08,529
to that screen so as you've seen I don't

423
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:10,809
have a keyboard in but I have a mouse

424
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:13,209
inside so it was written so actually

425
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:15,158
this mouse can write if you have the

426
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:16,929
decryption key or if you have no

427
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:21,070
encryption between your mouse and your

428
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:25,469
receiver okay hello Def Jam it's quite

429
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:30,428
good but can we do some really bad stuff

430
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:33,609
yes what kind of bad stuff partial

431
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:35,979
partial some other yeah why because if I

432
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:38,228
own keyboard I own your computer and now

433
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:40,450
if I own your computer I own your

434
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:42,849
digital identity and I everything that

435
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,639
I'm do even if I'm sitting in some other

436
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:48,908
room I'm actually doing in your let's

437
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:52,389
say in your digital identity I try with

438
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:56,109
some other but let's see probably this

439
00:21:52,389 --> 00:22:00,039
one would be also very interesting let's

440
00:21:56,109 --> 00:22:02,320
see if this one gets through okay why

441
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:07,599
it's waiting because I said delay for

442
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:09,668
several seconds see it was running yeah

443
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,139
and we got the web page probably we can

444
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:14,500
run the PowerShell or

445
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:19,860
load something current so let's see okay

446
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:22,840
the other thing that we can do it I I

447
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:26,469
was also you know my intention was to

448
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:29,050
show that also this one can click well

449
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:32,230
these remote clickers are a little bit

450
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,620
limited because they cannot send normal

451
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:38,460
characters they are limited to send only

452
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:41,469
I think four or six different characters

453
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,120
to the unifying dongle but there is a

454
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:49,390
trick who's using Windows

455
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:53,679
ok who's using Mac your say who's using

456
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:56,170
Linux cool you also save why because I

457
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,270
don't know if you remember how would you

458
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,630
write if you're a is not working so

459
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:04,000
slather a on keyboards tux or it's not

460
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:08,590
working how you would you write a but

461
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
not with not with the handwriting okay

462
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:18,699
we're sure without virtual keyboard

463
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:22,720
right yeah SKS key alt and on a

464
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,520
numerical keyboard are all 0 6 5 some of

465
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,130
them still remember and that's the trick

466
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,530
so with the alternatives you can write

467
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:32,410
with this also because all and other

468
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:34,030
stuff other numerical can write this so

469
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,830
that was the trick so if you're gonna

470
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,170
try you you will be playing with a

471
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,879
logitech ER you have to use alternative

472
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:42,310
string because otherwise it will not

473
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:49,020
work okay

474
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:53,110
I have this video I actually sniff I

475
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:57,070
save I made a small video because I

476
00:23:53,110 --> 00:24:01,209
probably would fail something because

477
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:03,460
now this one you see the unifying dongle

478
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:07,150
doesn't have any device and when we are

479
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:11,770
pairing if somebody is listening he can

480
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:14,410
also see that he gets the firing key so

481
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:17,790
device you see it was paired and if

482
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:20,230
you're listening to that pairing process

483
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,780
and because of the issues that had

484
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,740
Logitech products you can actually get

485
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,030
the key

486
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,950
and if you get the key you

487
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,129
get decrypt all the communication and

488
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:34,420
you're gonna see that I will be typing

489
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:38,890
something and I'll deaf camp rules but

490
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:41,620
the problem is that we get to - if you

491
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:47,080
press one one letter we get the two

492
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:49,419
letters why because as I said I enabled

493
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,240
a passive enumeration so everything that

494
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,620
I'm typing here it's actually sniffed

495
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,260
and repeat it again

496
00:24:53,620 --> 00:25:00,399
so that's sniffing so when you're

497
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:02,050
pairing go to a Faraday cage so nobody

498
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,150
is listening about and nobody's post

499
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:08,860
nobody has possibility to steal the keys

500
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,950
additional tool that Marcos release was

501
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,320
muna fiying tool it looks like he likes

502
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:18,280
golang so compile it on Linux because

503
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:22,000
it's you sleepy USB and actually can

504
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,820
dump it actually can dump the keys from

505
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,460
these dongles so that's why as I said

506
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,639
also if you know your keyboard is

507
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:35,740
connected over this dongle keep this

508
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:37,870
dongle secure what is our contribution

509
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,510
when we have been playing because we

510
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,489
have been let's say we had we had an

511
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:45,600
honor to be part of the private repos

512
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:48,370
before going to public we had some

513
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:53,110
summer school students during this

514
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:55,449
summer and he made a little bit to not

515
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,580
only Linux on the windows and after that

516
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,250
mark is created a new version that can

517
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:03,780
be easily let's say change but still we

518
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:10,420
have let's say some good good scenarios

519
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:12,550
scenario for that and this too looks

520
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,080
like this so in everything that is

521
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,800
pressed of course you need a decryption

522
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:22,300
key it's actually displayed also here

523
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:24,550
but with another addition this tool can

524
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,370
save all the communications so all the

525
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:32,500
although all the communication through

526
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:35,409
the log attacker into a file and if you

527
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,480
manage to get the key later it can

528
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,950
decrypt everything that somebody was

529
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,559
typing on

530
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:44,169
so for example if I sniff your keyboard

531
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,330
I don't have to I don't need to have the

532
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:48,970
encryption key now at this moment I can

533
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,369
save all the communication after I don't

534
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,080
know days months or years when I get the

535
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:54,100
encryption key I can decrypt all the

536
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,658
communication all the could the

537
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,899
Commission between your keyboard and

538
00:26:55,659 --> 00:27:00,609
your machine so this is actually our

539
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:05,279
contribution if somebody wants to play

540
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:07,418
it's actually published on github ok

541
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,629
when we have been playing you know a

542
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:14,739
logitech also keeps very updated version

543
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:17,248
so this one is from 2014 so probably it

544
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:25,169
has some also some kind of other issues

545
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:28,299
and I've been almost on time nobody's

546
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:30,999
trying to get me off the stage ok let's

547
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:32,549
get some crazy ideas about what can we

548
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:36,190
do about it

549
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:38,080
probably devices can be used for

550
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,529
different purposes

551
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,749
and also Logitech these devices can be

552
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:46,480
used for example something like this now

553
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:48,580
it's going to be Christmas so if

554
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,249
somebody wants to give some really nice

555
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:55,178
plasma ball to somebody he can weaponize

556
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:58,590
it with some heat device that skin type

557
00:27:55,179 --> 00:28:01,899
so it can be typing on his computer or

558
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:04,418
if you have really good business

559
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:07,449
partners you know you can send them

560
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:11,859
weaponized Mouse's why because every

561
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:14,529
mouse has little USB hop inside and you

562
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:18,519
just have to connect to that USB see

563
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:21,279
here it's actually weaponized hit device

564
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:24,639
and this is normal Mouse so if you take

565
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,549
it apart weaponize it pack it back send

566
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:32,678
it probably these this mouse can also

567
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:34,690
type so there are some other after

568
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,619
Marcos was doing this there were some

569
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:40,509
other crazy ideas like from Luca you

570
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:43,418
know he can actually change this kind of

571
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:45,940
cable so probably if you see this cable

572
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:49,869
on our table what would you see what

573
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:52,450
would you tell it's normal what normal

574
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:52,899
charger right but it's with some

575
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,600
addition

576
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,910
because here you can actually put in the

577
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,870
Logitech receiver that you can buy on

578
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:05,280
eBay for like $3 and you have the

579
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:08,050
control of that have the control of that

580
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,970
receiver and you can actually again type

581
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:13,200
on somebody else computer while you are

582
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:16,510
charging which is not completely true

583
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,720
wipe because if you're charging you're

584
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:22,510
taking all the power and hit device

585
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,120
doesn't work so it's a little bit

586
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,830
drawback and there are some other things

587
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,750
you know that's I don't know if somebody

588
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,389
understands Slovenian you know one guy

589
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,430
was asking me when we have been putting

590
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,850
this on the Twitter what should we do

591
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:40,240
about the logitech should we just throw

592
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:43,570
all devices into trash well almost

593
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,390
yeah because Lucca also said that login

594
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:49,710
tracker with USB memory cable proof plus

595
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:52,720
air gaps bypass you can actually own all

596
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:54,550
systems so nuclear plants power grids so

597
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,510
probably this is one good thing also for

598
00:29:54,550 --> 00:30:01,990
you Jason Street for his next adventure

599
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:03,990
and some other crazy ideas you know at

600
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:07,720
the same time when this was going on

601
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:11,470
logitech UK so Logitech G sore this kind

602
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:16,560
of gamers edition so gamer Mouse's like

603
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:20,340
a model g502 you know there are young

604
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:24,520
gamers showing how they cut their

605
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:28,149
logitech cords you know I'm saying we

606
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:30,460
want to switch to the Wi-Fi Mouse's well

607
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:34,770
that's not good idea why because if we

608
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:37,720
try to do this with g5 2 unifying

609
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:39,220
unifying dongle it's even faster so you

610
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,170
can type faster so the connection speed

611
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,260
is faster because the gamers need speed

612
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:47,440
you know so can you imagine running this

613
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,840
on LAN party and injecting somewhere you

614
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,840
know if you have like I know in Slovenia

615
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,419
we had like 400 people coming to the LAN

616
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,510
party and you know you're just injecting

617
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,000
into you know owning their computers in

618
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,100
could be really really fun or as I

619
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,010
mentioned already before if somebody at

620
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,730
the CTF you know you might have some

621
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,609
let's say

622
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:13,330
not friendly other teams that could

623
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:16,689
actually play with some play with some

624
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:18,428
communication and some people for

625
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:21,850
example this one Phillip crane he is

626
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:24,159
actually working for elasticsearch you

627
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,168
know some of them that are really going

628
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,710
on through the presentation take it

629
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:33,460
seriously and if you own some let's say

630
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:36,700
clicker or some other device actually

631
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:40,419
Logitech will replace it to you free of

632
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,190
charge if you if you send it so it's not

633
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:44,379
that bad can you imagine at some big

634
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,570
conference like here you know and

635
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:49,928
playing with somebody's clicker I know

636
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,789
when I was the presenter before me and

637
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:53,559
I'll explaining what I'm gonna do is it

638
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:56,259
like please don't play with my clicker

639
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:59,649
please don't play with my clicker so I

640
00:31:56,259 --> 00:32:01,179
was not I was no so what are the

641
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:04,350
solution what are the mitigation so

642
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:07,149
definitely we cannot disable USB right

643
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:11,230
because with USB it there coming also

644
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:14,768
the the unifying unifying receivers you

645
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:17,559
know probably the best way should be

646
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:21,279
update your dongle now the only problem

647
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:23,739
is if you're running some I know Windows

648
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,629
it's they're not updated automatically

649
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:28,359
you have to go you have to download the

650
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:31,988
firmware you have to update it or as I

651
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,970
do you can use bluetooth mouse that's

652
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:36,549
also solution but we have seen you know

653
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:38,769
this year also blue to red issues so

654
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:41,769
it's also a fun part so the corded Mouse

655
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:45,279
it's definitely maybe the best solution

656
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:48,129
of course one so if you're in some kind

657
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,590
of enterprise high mission-critical area

658
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:53,109
definitely you need kind of device

659
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:56,080
management to know what was being

660
00:32:53,109 --> 00:33:01,869
inserted into probably there's also

661
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:05,049
where you let's say a lot of place for

662
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:08,470
improvement also regarding the digital

663
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:11,350
forensic so how do you know if I plugged

664
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:14,109
in the unified dongle that I don't need

665
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:16,719
extra permission for it and maybe the

666
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:18,519
best one is so you just need to secure

667
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,800
your dongle so does this mean you have

668
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,970
to lock it or

669
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:26,850
never leave it out of your sights so and

670
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:29,820
as the last light you know as you have

671
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:34,080
seen you know the hit devices

672
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:44,700
you know let's make them great again

673
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:46,500
so techie thank you very much thank you

674
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,130
very much for an awesome presentation

675
00:33:46,500 --> 00:34:00,240
now are there any questions

676
00:33:49,130 --> 00:34:01,530
sure big one this is logic Tech working

677
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,440
because I was thinking about

678
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:06,389
software-defined radio sorry I was

679
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,020
thinking about software-defined radio

680
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:13,890
yeah on what frequencies 2.4 gig so

681
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,900
Wi-Fi okay thank you yeah and regarding

682
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:18,210
the logitech you know sometimes also the

683
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,850
big companies screw up they issue a

684
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:24,480
patch but the problem was they made a

685
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:27,569
wrong patch so actually you can they fix

686
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:32,280
the thing that you cannot you cannot

687
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:34,679
dump the keys from the transceivers but

688
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,169
there was a trick oops there was a trick

689
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,060
you can actually downgrade the firmware

690
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:43,049
on your dongle and the key still stay

691
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:49,400
there on the dongle and then just dump

692
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:52,860
the keys and upgraded it again so here

693
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,990
are there any public incidents in which

694
00:34:52,860 --> 00:35:00,230
this kind of vulnerability has been

695
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:04,169
exploited because in during a worthless

696
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:09,180
program which will be a good idea to to

697
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:11,670
use your life examples I'm not over but

698
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:15,540
when I showed this to one of the

699
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:18,420
ministries in Slovenia they all took of

700
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,000
these ministers they all took Wi-Fi

701
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:24,060
Mouse's from them and they put them on a

702
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,010
cabled Mouse's sokolovsky it's just but

703
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,870
we have a shot being aware because it's

704
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:30,330
really hard because it doesn't leave so

705
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:32,190
much tracer so because these dongles you

706
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,500
can you your plugin email you're

707
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,600
plugging it out so if

708
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,200
have done if you don't have some really

709
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,740
good digital forensics or logging

710
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,830
mechanism you don't even know so but I'm

711
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:48,950
not aware but probably let's say

712
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:51,230
adversaries are probably doing this on a

713
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:54,439
large scale thanks all right

714
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,990
questions from the right okay first of

715
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:01,370
all really nice presentation

716
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:03,529
second of all regarding that tweet well

717
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,720
the two tweets that you showed with the

718
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:10,430
person that got an upgraded Logitech

719
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:12,140
like clicker is that person aware of the

720
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,990
fact that that Logitech clicker might

721
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:17,690
might also be vulnerable because I'm

722
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:21,410
asking because I tested the whole

723
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:24,440
logical thing I'm well aware and right

724
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:27,259
now basically Logitech devices that are

725
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,500
still sold are still vulnerable

726
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,960
foodies I don't know I know Philippine

727
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:36,410
person so I will ask him next time I'll

728
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,260
try to get his presenter but as he got

729
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:46,129
the information from the Logitech let me

730
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:48,560
see secure again we don't know but it

731
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,800
might be that you know in some case it

732
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,120
still will be some kind of issues but at

733
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,830
the moment Marcus is playing with

734
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,140
different things so he's occupied with

735
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:59,390
another crazy idea so if you follow him

736
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:03,710
on Twitter you will be up to date with

737
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:05,299
hit devices so but follow me on Twitter

738
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:14,420
I will ask Marc Valvo

739
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:16,550
ask Philippa next next Meetup okay hi it

740
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,160
would not be possible for Logitech or

741
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:21,830
for any other vendor to implement some

742
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:24,649
kind of perfect for Ross secrecy because

743
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:27,230
I mean even if the encryption algorithm

744
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,630
is good and they don't find any

745
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,480
vulnerabilities they still can sniff my

746
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:34,820
traffic and I mean a keyboard for

747
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,900
instance is something typically people

748
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,910
give little to no value so if I type

749
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,040
something that I don't want to share

750
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,029
people can sniff it and then come back

751
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,680
later

752
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,750
take my keyboard smash

753
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:52,049
it look on the cheap or something like

754
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,470
that and read the key and that's not

755
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:58,620
good

756
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:59,939
I think yep here the AS IS when it's the

757
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,609
communication is script it insecure

758
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,430
plate with a SOAs it's kind of okay

759
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:09,890
right okay but the problem is with key

760
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:12,629
interchange how to how to this well

761
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,339
there are some limitation for that you

762
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,810
have to be close you know when you're

763
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,440
repairing the your mouse or your

764
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,520
keyboard

765
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,980
somebody needs to be close to you or

766
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,650
maybe some cleaning lady would let's say

767
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:29,460
if the mouse or the keyboard is already

768
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:32,280
part she can unpair everything and force

769
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,810
you to pair it again and sometimes you

770
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,240
know there are kind different kind of

771
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,970
scenarios that's why that's why he said

772
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,740
this is really huge issue you know this

773
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,959
is really huge issue and if you've got

774
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,600
the keys and if you're let's say

775
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,140
recording what everything somebody is

776
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,200
typing

777
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,660
so let's some Theo typing on his

778
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,000
computer you know you just record all

779
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:56,220
the keystrokes and then it's sometime

780
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,160
you get the key for that decryption and

781
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,629
when you get the key you get the all

782
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,759
history what he was typing so also the

783
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,460
usernames and passwords so that's why

784
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,160
you need to also these small devices you

785
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,960
need to keep them secure so what good

786
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:17,160
question all right let's take another

787
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:20,100
one left right one of the things we tend

788
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,960
to rely on is Active Directory and no

789
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,549
had been right so you can hack my

790
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,860
information but you're getting that

791
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,030
users information alone you're not

792
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,950
having admin rights

793
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:31,710
you can't run anything on PowerShell is

794
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,899
it that level of security that you could

795
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:36,660
I know it's not reliable but at least

796
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,820
some how reliable isn't it what do you

797
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:41,250
mean exactly if you're not if you're if

798
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:44,160
you're PowerShell is disabled yeah power

799
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,140
shows disabled on the computer yeah you

800
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:50,100
don't have admin rights so even if you

801
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:51,569
were to well yeah but the dongles you

802
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,100
don't eat administrative rights because

803
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:57,750
they're installed automatically so it is

804
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:59,520
for that but anyway and if I manage

805
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,180
somehow to get into the communication

806
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,759
between your

807
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,129
keyboards and your machine then this

808
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,400
machine is mine and your digital

809
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,540
identity is mine so I don't need

810
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,880
sometimes I don't need even the

811
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,650
administrator rights on that machine or

812
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,660
some privilege user interactive domain

813
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:18,210
because I can sniff whatever you type or

814
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,910
I can open some other project programs

815
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,829
not necessarily the PowerShell but

816
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,980
partial can be run in different kind of

817
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:28,410
ways not only the partial remember that

818
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,530
so even if you delete power Charlotte

819
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:33,720
itza there's actually they're all what

820
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:37,530
is called automation somewhere behind so

821
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,819
you don't need so but all right so I

822
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,010
think we have time for one last question

823
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:42,599
err there was a gentleman here gesturing

824
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:47,040
do you still want to ask you a question

825
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:50,790
okay this is a territory which I didn't

826
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,940
explore this vulnerability I want to ask

827
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:58,319
everything you you showed us today was

828
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:02,670
about Logitech yes and there are other

829
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:08,069
devices and yet these tools can be used

830
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:11,190
on Mouse Microsoft Mouse's for example

831
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:13,829
we have seen I don't know if you can

832
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:20,190
hear see it here but let me see to do my

833
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:25,079
little magic with this from 2016 not

834
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:27,329
only the devices that have been using no

835
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,339
encryption at all so you have the

836
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:35,250
Microsoft you have the Dell you have the

837
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:37,200
IBM you have Amazon Mouse's they are not

838
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:40,020
using corruption at all so you can

839
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,879
easily inject yourself into this non

840
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,119
encrypting communication and that Mouse

841
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,730
is that are not let's say update that

842
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,309
are fixed yet there still can be used as

843
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:52,020
a plain as a keyboard so there are some

844
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:54,660
also some other vendors but these

845
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:57,750
Logitech are actually only handles the

846
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:03,118
logitech issues that there are tools for

847
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:05,599
this ones let's say for 2016 so three

848
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,670
years old and they still haven't pageant

849
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,940
