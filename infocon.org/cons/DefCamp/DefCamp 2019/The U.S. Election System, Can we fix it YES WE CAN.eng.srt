1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,970
buna ziua bucharest buna ziua romania

2
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:20,250
she buna ziua mama ok everybody

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:24,710
so let's get started my talk is the

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,448
election system can we fix it yes we can

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:33,719
solutions to improve the election system

6
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:37,500
with yours truly be a scilab so Who am I

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,290
I'm a 12 year old girl I was a younger

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,969
speaker at Hope hackers on planet earth

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,610
which is one of the oldest hacker

10
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,800
conferences I am now a three times

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,230
speaker at Def Con I spoke at the voting

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,129
village the bio hacking village and the

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:56,760
Ruth asylum I am a maker and a hacker

14
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,858
and my election hacking from the roots

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,930
asylum was highlighted at a

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,059
congressional hearing on election

17
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:09,270
security here is me with the witness

18
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:12,179
panel while this talk will be focused on

19
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,460
the u.s. election system the lessons

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,619
learned here can apply to any election

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:22,530
system worldwide so what did the roots

22
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,439
Asylum do they held a mock election

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,350
reporting system and us kids got to

24
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,350
perform sequel injection to change the

25
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,780
results what is sequel injection you may

26
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,169
ask here is part of my girls who hacked

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,570
course on sequel injection

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:44,579
dun-da-da-da the application in this

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,740
case a webform that talks to the

30
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,798
database is tricked into sending an

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,720
attack query so here is the classic

32
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,000
username and password field now here is

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:03,600
a simple attack or one equals one is

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,640
true so this is the code sequel equals

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,589
select from users where name equals you

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,330
name and pass equals you pass

37
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,670
so it's requesting a username and a

38
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,740
password and let's say Alice wants to

39
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,250
attack the

40
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:19,310
website because I mean why not so she

41
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,910
puts in Alice double-quote or one equals

42
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,090
one

43
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:27,109
they user name field and then Alice pass

44
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:30,170
or double quote or one equals one in the

45
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:33,680
past field so then this command in

46
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:37,030
orange gets sent to the database select

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,580
from users where name equals you name

48
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,280
where you name equals Alice or one

49
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:47,690
equals one and pass equals Alice pass or

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,630
one equals one does one equal one yes

51
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,800
okay good

52
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,920
you passed the test

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,390
you all greet graduated from preschool

54
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,660
yay

55
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:02,119
goldstar stickers for everyone and then

56
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,670
the sequel above is valid and will turn

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,680
all rows from the user and past table

58
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:14,540
since or one equals one is always true

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:17,090
back to my talk sequel injection like I

60
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,700
said the kids and I and the roots column

61
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,240
did this attack last year and this year

62
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:27,619
you're thinking big deal it was rigged

63
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:30,200
for the kids but Russia use the same

64
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,150
sequel injection attack and successfully

65
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,480
broke into a State Board of Elections

66
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:39,170
website where they gained access to the

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,480
voter records and exfiltrated them they

68
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,079
were then able to pivot into the network

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,840
and who knows what happened after that

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,330
this is outlined in Volume one on pages

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,550
50 and 51 of the Mueller report if you

72
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:58,880
don't believe me now let's start what

73
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:03,380
the election system the election system

74
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:06,200
has a huge attack surface over 10,000

75
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,660
voting precincts voter registration

76
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,060
databases voting machines reporting

77
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,150
systems and of course election officials

78
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,640
as dr. Latanya Sweeney said at the

79
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,760
hearing on voting technology

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:24,460
vulnerabilities every step introduces a

81
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,460
vulnerability and I agree with you

82
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:31,818
and let me just say they're problems

83
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:34,219
everywhere most states lack the

84
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:36,440
resources and technical expertise and

85
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,289
let's face it they are election

86
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,990
officials not computer security experts

87
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:46,490
if not we wouldn't be in this situation

88
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:48,289
they have aging equipment many of the

89
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,960
voting machines that have been pawned at

90
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:55,280
the voting village at DEFCON are still

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,919
in use in many districts they have a

92
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,559
lack of consistent funding for security

93
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,060
a lot of the voting security money comes

94
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,240
in a lump sum

95
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,909
this is fixes problems now but not in

96
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,780
the future states need consistent voting

97
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:15,550
security budgets attacked by foreign

98
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:18,440
adversaries with endless time and money

99
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:21,800
versus the underfunded state and local

100
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,560
election websites or Stephen Frank have

101
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,440
to secure them along with all the other

102
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,569
sites and help Bob print out his emails

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:34,490
who do you think will win in that

104
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:37,759
situation then NIST's election security

105
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:41,779
research team consists of one full-time

106
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,430
for part-time and four contractors there

107
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,259
are more people working at a single

108
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:50,569
McDonald's and they are working on

109
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:53,599
election security people like really so

110
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:55,639
let's jump into more problems and how to

111
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:58,009
solve them this is me at the

112
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,629
Pennsylvania voting machine review where

113
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,870
we are allowed to examine the machines

114
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:05,629
all we wanted either of them crazy this

115
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,759
simple to pick lock covers the USB ports

116
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:15,550
that contain the votes and the software

117
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,550
update port so wow I mean look at that

118
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:21,198
now for all of you wondering how the

119
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:25,099
u.s. election system works here is a

120
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,979
brief overview SEP number one voters

121
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:29,599
must register to vote it's not automatic

122
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:31,430
because that would actually make sense

123
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:36,800
we want to make the election system as

124
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:38,129
complicated as we can right then you

125
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,379
cast your vote

126
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:43,559
it's done at your local voting precinct

127
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,449
not the one by your work it has to be by

128
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:48,269
your house so you've got to wake up

129
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:50,819
early go vote and then go to work and

130
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:53,789
yes it is not a national holiday it's

131
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:56,219
still a work day then the voter is

132
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:59,580
identity is verified and then your vote

133
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:05,489
is cast the voting machines differ from

134
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:08,519
precinct to precinct then the votes are

135
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:11,549
tabulated at a local ven state level in

136
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:14,369
the presidential election the Electoral

137
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,499
College decides the president this keeps

138
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:20,129
the larger states from having too much

139
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:24,629
power and as January generally based on

140
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:26,729
the state's popular vote the Electoral

141
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:31,559
College can be talking itself but I'm

142
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:34,169
just keeping it short for you guys okay

143
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:36,929
so here are some voting a sack of voting

144
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,448
machines at the vote waiting village duh

145
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:41,399
a DEFCON I'm pretty sure this was

146
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:45,800
actually the first of first voting

147
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:48,839
village at DEFCON two now voter

148
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,209
registration systems they differ from

149
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,579
state to state some have standalone

150
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,889
systems while other tie in with their

151
00:07:53,579 --> 00:08:00,509
Department of Motor Vehicles driver's

152
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:03,269
registration system everyone including

153
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,759
bad guys nation states and groups trying

154
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:08,309
to upset democracy is trying to hack

155
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,409
these systems all the time if you

156
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:12,719
monitor an intrusion detection system

157
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:15,748
which is a machine that examines all the

158
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:17,490
network traffic you will see constant

159
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:20,219
attacks like sequel injection cross-site

160
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,579
scripting and other exploits from all

161
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:27,990
over the world including Russia China as

162
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:30,629
well as tor exit notes okay now there's

163
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,579
something really important that I want

164
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:35,729
you all to listen if you're on your

165
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:39,448
phones pay attention don't pick your

166
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:43,110
nose and listen to this the scary thing

167
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:46,109
is election officials are not required

168
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:49,380
to report any detected compromises or

169
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,660
vulnerabilities in these systems

170
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,210
if the election was hacked we wouldn't

171
00:08:51,660 --> 00:09:03,180
know maybe they know but there they

172
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:03,840
don't have to tell us so how do we fix

173
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,719
this

174
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,110
while voter registration systems are

175
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,850
things we actually know how to secure

176
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,590
website and database security is

177
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,070
something we know one have security

178
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:21,420
standards for so let's use some

179
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:23,460
guidelines number one there is OS wasp

180
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,569
or the open web application security

181
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:30,120
project they have tons of resources too

182
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,450
many to list here the NIST cybersecurity

183
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:37,020
framework provides a way to identify

184
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:40,140
protect and detect any compromises then

185
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,180
there is open SCAP or security content

186
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,490
automation protocol that supports

187
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,530
automated configuration vulnerability

188
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,860
patch checking and security measurement

189
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:52,439
then my personal favorite the SAFE Act

190
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,400
which is still currently sitting in

191
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,360
Congress but I hope I really hope it

192
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,100
becomes a thing

193
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,020
so here's more on the safe fact the SAFE

194
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,260
Act requires many important things

195
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,360
including voter verified paper ballots

196
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:14,550
these are important because the voter

197
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:17,190
actually verifies their vote and then

198
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,760
there is an analogue paper trail so you

199
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:22,110
can check with a physical piece of paper

200
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,870
there are risk limiting audits

201
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,480
that's where votes are counted by humans

202
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:30,930
to make sure the machines are accurate

203
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,420
and using risk limiting audits and voter

204
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:38,219
verified paper ballots are best defense

205
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:40,740
against election tampering then you've

206
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,490
built your reporting system now what

207
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,530
test it first make sure it actually

208
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,080
works because that's kind of important

209
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,839
then have your team test it make sure

210
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,260
you cover the basics like the top ten

211
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,570
and fix the bugs don't waste your budget

212
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,950
on having professionals come in just to

213
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,330
tell you what could you could have found

214
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:05,180
out by yourself next step

215
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,890
test it with hackers make sure it is

216
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,530
fully tested before you bring in an

217
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:12,319
external pen testing team they will find

218
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,819
things that you never thought of if you

219
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,460
are thinking that the systems out there

220
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:21,020
secure well let me tell you they are not

221
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,090
hackers have found siegel injection

222
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:27,140
working on a state site just recently

223
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:30,110
like two weeks ago states need to have a

224
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,860
bug bounty or at very least a clear

225
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,390
channel for reporting vulnerabilities

226
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:39,530
if registered to vote

227
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:42,230
now what hacking the voting machines oh

228
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:47,000
wait sorry just the voting machines

229
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:48,560
themselves voting machines you would

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,860
think the US would have a thriving

231
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,719
voting machine industry unfortunately

232
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,640
this is not true if you want to make a

233
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,880
voting machine you need to make the

234
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,310
entire system everything from the voter

235
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,860
registration system the voting machine

236
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:08,000
then the tabulator and reporting system

237
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,090
this is why 80% of the u.s. voting

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,750
machines are made by two manufacturers

239
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:18,670
yes in US and Dominion yes in us by

240
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:22,760
global election systems which became

241
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:26,240
Diebold oh they're so insecure as you'll

242
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,490
see soon yes and a senior programmer and

243
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,290
VP was convicted of computer software

244
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:35,600
tampering and embezzlement in 2004 they

245
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,449
performed an emergency software patch in

246
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,230
37 swing states these are key states

247
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:44,870
that could swing the election one way or

248
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,570
the other I wonder why they only did it

249
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:51,110
in the swing states something's fishy

250
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,940
there then Georgia and Tennessee have

251
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,500
reported machines losing votes in

252
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,320
predominantly african-american

253
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:03,260
neighborhoods now that just doesn't

254
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:05,540
sound right these manufacturers keep

255
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,780
their source close and will threaten to

256
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:12,290
sue people if they try to examine their

257
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,650
software the daibul gems tabulator was

258
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,630
found

259
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,930
lowering vote counts it's not

260
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:22,410
that hard people vote gets vote plus one

261
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:26,280
or for my C fans out there vote plus

262
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:29,189
plus many machines and tabulators have

263
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:34,620
hidden back doors that allow votes to be

264
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:38,690
manipulated during the election now

265
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:43,290
let's talk about direct recording

266
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:45,570
systems direct recording systems are

267
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:48,209
voting machines that do not produce a

268
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,870
human readable paper trail these

269
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:54,600
machines cannot not be made secure so

270
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:59,790
please follow my advice and don't use

271
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:02,490
them as was proven every year at Def Con

272
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:06,180
voting village the vote count can be

273
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,800
undetectably manipulated these types of

274
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,949
machines are used in many countries

275
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,540
around the world including Brazil who

276
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:19,980
wants to guess who made the machines in

277
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:21,630
Brazil Diebold yay not really you know

278
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:32,780
what I would trust more than a direct

279
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:36,120
recording system yeah now paper ballots

280
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:39,660
another way to collect votes is with

281
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:43,350
paper ballots there are two types number

282
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:46,800
one hand marked paper ballots this is

283
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:49,170
the best most secure option these are

284
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,630
marked by the voter themselves scanned

285
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:55,620
with an electronic scanner or counted by

286
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,870
hand then ballot marking devices these

287
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,590
were originally made for the handicapped

288
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,750
voters but what demand for public for

289
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:06,690
paper ballots the voting machine

290
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:10,640
manufacturers saw an opportunity to sell

291
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:13,290
more expensive BMDs as paper ballots

292
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,560
there are a few problems with these

293
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,300
machines if the human flips here if the

294
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,130
machine flips your vote what do they do

295
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:25,380
was a human error or a machine error

296
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,600
some machines print a barcode as a paper

297
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,100
trail how do you know what it says

298
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,840
fat bar skinny

299
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:36,810
fat bar fat bar skinny bar this just in

300
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,990
BMD suck some new machines take up to 10

301
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:42,900
minutes to switch screens while voting

302
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:45,120
10 minutes if there's a long line you

303
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,390
just want to jump right out texas

304
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,600
machines unable to read RFID voter card

305
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,630
causing massive delays again people want

306
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,180
to get out of the line and go to work

307
00:15:53,630 --> 00:16:00,689
brand new SNS machines reporting zero

308
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,170
Democrat votes on printout but then once

309
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:09,720
they do a hand cow it reveals that

310
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:14,490
Democrats won hmm this just in do your

311
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:17,070
ease sock Virginia change to hand marked

312
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,990
paper ballots and the Democrats won for

313
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:25,840
the first time in twenty years

314
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:27,530
something's wrong there too so now let's

315
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,600
[Music]

316
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:33,000
the Accu vote is a direct recording

317
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,560
system some of them have a printer so

318
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,780
that the voter can verify their vote

319
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:42,479
some don't in 2007 one year after I was

320
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,819
born the source code was reviewed by

321
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,950
state of California and they found it

322
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,800
was susceptible to viruses that could

323
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:53,010
alter the vote count my friends over at

324
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,290
the hacker house were able to load their

325
00:16:53,010 --> 00:17:00,770
own phone firmware into the machine and

326
00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:05,069
could do this hacker house 2020 election

327
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:10,530
fixing software hack toy injecting new

328
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:14,550
United States President CDC loading

329
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:20,399
operating system rigging election they

330
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:23,609
were also able to do this and what does

331
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,040
every hardware hacker ask can you play

332
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,040
Doom on it yes yes you can

333
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,940
[Applause]

334
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:42,300
now I have a question for all of you

335
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:51,330
where are your voting machines stored

336
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:54,110
right meow well if you live in the US

337
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:58,710
where are your voting machines right now

338
00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:01,110
say you don't know how I live they are

339
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,500
stored in cold storage so how well are

340
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,280
they secured while in cold storage hey

341
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,220
Bob

342
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,620
where are the spare traffic cones oh you

343
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,610
know by the voting machines where I eat

344
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,750
my lunch and get this they protected it

345
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:21,030
with one thing no one can get past

346
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:29,130
caution tape everybody those caution

347
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:31,680
tape back away back to cold storage bad

348
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,310
actors can purchase machines off the

349
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,230
internet

350
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,450
reverse the software and the firmware

351
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,910
then install the hack software and

352
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,650
firmware on machines and cold storage

353
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,710
while these machines may have

354
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:47,460
tamper-evident seals they really are not

355
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:50,760
that tamper evident here is me at DEFCON

356
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,100
25 removing tamper-evident tape with

357
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,440
acetone that's also known as fingernail

358
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,570
polish for all of you out there I was

359
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,670
then able to reapply with no noticeable

360
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,010
difference all you need is a syringe

361
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,920
some nail polish remover get a little in

362
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,440
the syringe and a little at a time on

363
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:11,040
the seal you squirt a little it comes

364
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,170
out it's still sticky you manipulate the

365
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:18,830
voting machine in the box then you tape

366
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,830
it back again and you go eat lunch boo

367
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:25,350
so what can we do to secure voting

368
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,290
machines in cold storage well we can

369
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:31,110
invest in more secure storage monitored

370
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:34,970
security systems and cameras complex

371
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:41,939
locks and booby traps

372
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:44,310
okay maybe not booby traps wink another

373
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,020
way to help secure voting machines is to

374
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,990
reinstall the software and firmware

375
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:51,900
before the election making sure to

376
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,240
softer fingerprints and checksums before

377
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,880
installing doing this will not only

378
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,070
ensure the latest patch software is

379
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,660
running it will also wipe out any

380
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:05,820
malicious code that may have been

381
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:09,510
installed it's a two-for-one deal so

382
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:12,110
where does your vote go next different

383
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:15,420
election systems have different ways to

384
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:17,790
delivering the final vote count votes

385
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,160
are printed out in triplicate checked

386
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,649
and signed by poll workers these are

387
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,220
then phoned in in sent by car to the

388
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:29,580
election office USB sticks by car is

389
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:34,170
that data file encrypted if not it can

390
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,970
be manipulated some machines report

391
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:39,420
their counts by cellular data

392
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:42,420
transmission this still goes over the

393
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:46,800
public Internet but we all know how

394
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:49,679
secure the Internet is right yeah it is

395
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,530
also worth stating that there is no

396
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:58,110
established chain of custody rules for

397
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:59,850
any of these delivery methods so how do

398
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,969
you secure in transit

399
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:05,689
well you encrypt the records while being

400
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:09,179
transmitted and while at rest you

401
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:11,640
perform with risk limiting audits make

402
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:15,090
sure the paper ballots match what the

403
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,550
machine recorded and please do not use

404
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,500
the public Internet the machine

405
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,990
manufacturers want you to think that

406
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,640
cellular modems are not connected to the

407
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:28,710
public Internet guess what they are here

408
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,300
is a diagram the manufacturers could

409
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:35,910
learn from this is me

410
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:39,178
that's the voting machine over there on

411
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,040
the Left transmitting over the air with

412
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:43,980
its cellular modem to the cell tower

413
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:46,110
that's connected to the public Internet

414
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,650
where my friend Rainbow Dash is taking a

415
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:52,500
nap then the voting tabulator is

416
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,559
connected to the internet behind a

417
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,950
firewall but firewalls do not stop

418
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,950
hackers

419
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:06,389
now the next step the next step is the

420
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:08,759
vote count reporting systems these just

421
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:11,279
like the voter registration systems are

422
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:14,489
standard things we know how to secure

423
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,169
and again like registration systems we

424
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:19,440
should follow industry standards and

425
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:26,460
guidelines I recycle this slide I'm

426
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:30,749
going green remember wasp NIST opens gap

427
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:36,679
safe and remember encrypt data in

428
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:41,340
transmission and while at rest now

429
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:43,979
humans they have so many flaws that's

430
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:47,599
why I like cats better and let's face it

431
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:50,279
all the security in the world can't stop

432
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:53,609
Bob from clicking on a link you

433
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,979
shouldn't yeah really Bob come on you

434
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:58,799
can do better than that

435
00:22:54,979 --> 00:23:00,899
spear phishing campaigns exist and have

436
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,840
been successful against voting machine

437
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:06,449
manufacturers using fake emails they can

438
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,289
direct to users to fake websites that

439
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:12,749
compromised their machines mr. Kelly who

440
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,960
is Registrar of Voters at Orange County

441
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:19,289
California sit at the hearing how well

442
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,929
are my election officials trained not to

443
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:27,720
click on links they shouldn't chances

444
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:32,009
are not well enough sorry mr. Kelly now

445
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:34,529
social engineering election officials

446
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:38,099
must be regularly trained on how not to

447
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:41,039
be socially engineered regular training

448
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:48,059
is very important not just during the

449
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:50,340
election season now fix the humans stage

450
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,519
should form election working groups with

451
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,320
local federal and state officials

452
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:58,109
including the Department of Homeland

453
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,019
Security the FBI as well as the state

454
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:06,899
Cyber Command this knowledge should be

455
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:09,389
shared across the entire state so you're

456
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:13,260
like yeah yeah all these problems all

457
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:15,879
these solutions what's the big fix

458
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:19,690
well we need to look at the election

459
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,100
system as a very hackable security

460
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,290
problem from the start

461
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:28,060
security can't be something we just bolt

462
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:31,030
on on the end the election system is one

463
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,679
big hardware and software system so we

464
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,860
need to train our developers and

465
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,820
engineers teach them secure coding from

466
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,219
the start

467
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,439
teach them how to hack and think like a

468
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,600
hacker so that they can better code

469
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,000
systems that are more difficult to

470
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:52,840
compromise send them to security

471
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,850
conferences and hire hackers they bring

472
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:59,399
a different perspective they think

473
00:24:54,850 --> 00:25:01,600
around outside and destroy the box I

474
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,380
hope I woke up any of you who are

475
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,810
sleeping there are security minded

476
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,600
individuals to whom everything is a

477
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:16,510
secure puzzle just waiting to be solved

478
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:19,360
it's right there also don't be afraid to

479
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:22,690
hire hackers without certifications kids

480
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,729
right out of school too they bring they

481
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:30,040
will bring an excitement and desire to

482
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:34,570
prove themselves beyond expectations so

483
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:38,980
what is the best system hand marked

484
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:41,139
paper ballots I made this really big so

485
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,080
you can take a picture and if you're not

486
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,900
taking a picture you better you better

487
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:52,689
memorize this okay okay

488
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:56,880
and with risk limiting audits I'll give

489
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,880
you guys a second to take a picture

490
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:12,399
[Applause]

491
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:14,189
okay everyone I have a big announcement

492
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,350
to make

493
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:29,250
next year at Def Con I will have

494
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:29,250
drumroll please my own election system

495
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,759
[Applause]

496
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:41,080
in a quick shout-out to one Dark One for

497
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:44,320
making this amazing logo my election

498
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:47,470
system that I'm making myself will be

499
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,889
called secure open vote and this awesome

500
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,470
logo has the SS unlock the circle as the

501
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:57,340
oh and the checkmark as a V secure open

502
00:26:53,470 --> 00:27:01,779
bow cool right so what will secure open

503
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:04,389
vote be well secure open vote is an open

504
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:06,399
source voting system used with hand

505
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:09,340
marked paper ballots cuz that's the

506
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:12,370
safest type my goal is to have a

507
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:14,860
complete end-to-end system I figure I

508
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,418
have the smartest hacker friends we

509
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,840
could probably make a pretty awesome

510
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:23,559
election system I hope to have parts of

511
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:27,220
it available at Def Con for the hackers

512
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:29,549
to try to hack now what are your

513
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,549
questions

514
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:46,269
that was absolutely awesome we can take

515
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:49,719
about three to five questions defending

516
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:52,119
gun just make it you know quick and keep

517
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:54,219
it short in the suite so we can fit in

518
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:57,158
more of you please keep your hands up

519
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:59,169
until Mike gets to you so we can see

520
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,239
where you are put your hand up and it

521
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:02,859
would also help if you stood up while

522
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:05,529
you were talking so I can actually see

523
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:10,239
where you are and so they know who to

524
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:14,979
give the mic to okay so if you have the

525
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:17,139
mic stand up stand up whoever has a mic

526
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:20,859
I hope no one stole it and it's running

527
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:24,309
off when I did their back oh hello hello

528
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:26,499
thanks for the presentation BIA my

529
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:30,879
question is related to Romania because

530
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:33,669
we have paper ballots here but we also

531
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:35,408
have a problem where people stand in

532
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:37,299
line to vote especially people who are

533
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:40,209
outside of the country and have to vote

534
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,369
in consulates and places like that so

535
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:44,950
they are considering introducing

536
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:46,749
electronic voting and obviously I guess

537
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,679
no one here would trust the government

538
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:52,149
to implement something like that so what

539
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,549
would you tell the Romanian officials

540
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,748
who are considering introducing

541
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:58,629
electronic voting which you have in the

542
00:28:55,749 --> 00:29:01,779
West for a long time thank you paper

543
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:04,269
ballots are amazing I think they should

544
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:06,279
stick with paper ballots please do not

545
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:08,619
change to our chronic voting machines

546
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:11,559
those are super hard to secure the

547
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:15,579
elections can be tampered with so please

548
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:18,009
say two paper ballots and to solve that

549
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:20,709
problem I don't I'm not sure if it is

550
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:22,869
already but if it isn't then make it a

551
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:25,209
national holiday I think it should be

552
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:27,488
everywhere yeah and it I don't know how

553
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:29,820
many days they are allowed to vote Dana

554
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:32,950
mom because you're Romanian you know

555
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,218
well if you have like three days maybe

556
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:40,019
it could be more days than that so

557
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:43,809
people have more time to vote more

558
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:46,809
places to vote maybe or a bigger space a

559
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:48,039
bigger precinct a little space to vote

560
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:50,678
with more

561
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:54,158
Sheens so yeah I hope that answers your

562
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,729
question awesome let's go to the next

563
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,379
one please stand up make yourselves show

564
00:29:56,729 --> 00:30:00,700
thank you for presentation I'm really

565
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:03,309
amazed that you are so young and you've

566
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,799
done this and the question that I have

567
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:07,570
is that what is the most important

568
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:09,489
advice that you can give to the young

569
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:13,289
girls out there who want to start the

570
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:16,479
career in cyber security or hacking I

571
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:17,799
say just go for it if you don't know

572
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:20,019
where to start there are a lot of

573
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,408
resources on this amazing thing called

574
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:27,460
the Internet and if it's a girl wanting

575
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:29,889
to learn cybersecurity and hacking I a

576
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:32,590
couple months ago I just started girls

577
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:36,340
who hack on my t-shirt it says girls who

578
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:38,109
hack is their motto is teaching girls

579
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,539
the skills of hacking so that they can

580
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:43,449
change they're the future

581
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:46,570
it gives free lessons to on my website

582
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:51,190
girls who hack com2 any girl who wants

583
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:58,960
to learn cyber security and hacking an

584
00:30:51,190 --> 00:31:01,869
awesome keep that in mind okay two more

585
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,529
questions we have one in the back there

586
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:07,928
oh we have some one here and then we'll

587
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:09,849
come to your promise thank you very much

588
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:13,599
for your talk can you move the mic

589
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:16,299
closer tear it it's okay thank you very

590
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,489
much for your talk and I'm wondering if

591
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:20,649
there are any regulations because the

592
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:23,830
voting system from the yes looks like

593
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:28,418
inherently insecure and we're icarus

594
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:29,999
because it's the voting democracy and I

595
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:34,479
would expect to have really strong

596
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:36,309
regulations in this area exactly they

597
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:39,789
actually don't really have any

598
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:41,918
guidelines pretty much at all so like I

599
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:44,879
said on two slides guidelines exist

600
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,349
let's use them I hope the SAFE Act

601
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:49,059
passes in Congress and it becomes a

602
00:31:47,349 --> 00:31:51,249
thing because it sounds super awesome

603
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:54,399
if we all change to hand marked paper

604
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:56,649
ballots and have the it be a national

605
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,529
holiday with risk limiting audits I'm

606
00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:01,050
pretty sure we can secure way better

607
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:05,680
than it is

608
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:08,050
thank you so one last question I know we

609
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,000
have someone there please give the

610
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:15,159
gentleman a mic he's been keep your

611
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,410
hands up yes yes we can do it yes that's

612
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,690
teamwork

613
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:21,730
teamwork makes the dream work very

614
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,610
interesting presentation congrats for

615
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:28,120
that and very interesting subject

616
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:33,639
Bianca one very quick question what is

617
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:36,610
your IQ I've never taken a test but I'm

618
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,250
hoping it's really high but your IQ

619
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:43,000
isn't what your IQ is it's about how you

620
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:45,130
feel like you could even be 70 years old

621
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,860
and super smart or five years old and

622
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,480
super smart it's about how you feel and

623
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,969
what you think you know that really

624
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,850
matters same with how young you feel you

625
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:57,660
can be 80 and still like doing the hula

626
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,659
and what not

627
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,929
thank you so much Viet was so awesome to

628
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,940
have you here on stage with us and I

629
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:11,559
hope this is only the first time and

630
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,429
definitely not the less so thank you

631
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:14,428
again thank you

632
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,299
[Applause]
