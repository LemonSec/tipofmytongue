1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,020
I'm gonna start even though there are so

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,670
people coming into the room because

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:09,899
there's really never enough time to talk

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,969
everything that needs to be discussed

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,500
about security

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:20,189
my name is to there Damian as was said

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,689
I'm a managing partner at Vale go that's

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,420
where we offer what we like to call

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,840
peace of mind as a service essentially

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,710
it's managed services around mostly the

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,710
Microsoft cloud our office 365 and

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,890
things like that I also deal with

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,320
security and I've been doing that for a

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,829
while I've been involved in a lot of

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,550
community activities if any of you have

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,410
ever been to say IT Camp in Cluj it's an

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,709
event that's been going on for a while

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,709
now

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:03,650
the purpose of today's talk is to try

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:06,900
and give you a big picture over why

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,510
people are moving to the cloud how they

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,780
end up there and once they are there

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,520
what's some of the stuff that they have

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,700
to deal with when it comes to security

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,399
and compliance and it's a talk that's

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,259
mostly about things that people and

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:32,009
companies know they have to do but they

28
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:33,840
rarely do it's not gonna be of too much

29
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,890
of a technical talk it's more of a

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,590
principles and approaches and overview a

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,610
discussion but I honestly hope that

32
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,799
you'll leave the room with at least some

33
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:50,850
ideas or some additional ideas of how

34
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,579
how these things can get done as I

35
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,740
mentioned I mostly work with the

36
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,860
Microsoft stack of technologies but my

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,710
colleagues also deal with AWS and Google

38
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,539
clouds as well so a lot of the stuff

39
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,969
that I'm going to talk about apply to

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,280
pretty much any cloud provider and any

41
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,579
cloud solution out there I will have

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,090
some examples in the end of how

43
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,800
Microsoft does it and there's equivalent

44
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,560
examples with the other cloud providers

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,850
as well but just to give you an idea and

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,130
I'll also talk some stuff about how we

47
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,560
handle these things and some of the

48
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:34,350
challenges that that we've we've faced

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,960
so starting with this whole new thing

50
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,030
right it's digital transformation every

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,920
company out there everyone is doing this

52
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,410
and if you're not doing it you're not

53
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,480
cool and there's a lot of digital

54
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,670
transformation initiatives that we've

55
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:54,359
seen with our customers so far the

56
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:56,160
reality is a bit more grim when it comes

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,470
to digital transformation so for

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,210
instance the guys over at the Wall

59
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:05,100
Street Journal did a survey and it's

60
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,650
obvious that digital transformation is a

61
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,769
major concern especially for c-level

62
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,890
people and senior executives yet if we

63
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:17,130
are to look at the past year alone

64
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:20,549
nearly 70% of all digital transformation

65
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:25,100
initiatives failed so it's wasted money

66
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:27,959
wasted time it's like we we want to play

67
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,480
around with some stuff and we want to do

68
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,310
things and in the end you don't end up

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,220
doing the things that you started to do

70
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,380
you just spent a lot of money and spend

71
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,260
a lot of time or wasted a lot of time

72
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:47,790
doing it and you see some some numbers

73
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:51,720
there the problem is that companies tend

74
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,190
to go with the new shiny stuff because

75
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,290
everyone else is doing it

76
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,989
not because I actually need it not

77
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,780
because it solves a business problem but

78
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,630
because well my competition is doing it

79
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,400
so I must be lagging behind if I'm not

80
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,620
doing it myself so they end up doing

81
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,640
things that they don't need or investing

82
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,130
in things that don't help them instead

83
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,579
of actually trying to figure out what it

84
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:21,238
is that might help them better so the

85
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:24,270
the solutions around this particular

86
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,479
conundrum is to try and define your

87
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,919
strategy before

88
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,560
you start investing in anything and

89
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,480
that's quite rare it's you try it first

90
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,490
and then you realize hey this is not for

91
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,600
me this is not helping me how about we

92
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,330
think this through

93
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,330
the next time well how about you think

94
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:43,690
this through the first time so that's

95
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,210
that's one thing a second thing is well

96
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,520
we want to try something new so it's

97
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,570
obvious that we need to go talk to

98
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,810
somebody who knows that we we won't work

99
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,820
with any of our insiders we will just go

100
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:02,260
to somebody else an external third party

101
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:05,530
and ask them to do it for us now those

102
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:08,980
people will have what two three days a

103
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:12,510
week to figure out 20 years worth of

104
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:15,970
internal processes and business needs

105
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,130
the stuff that your guys your people

106
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,220
inside the company know much much better

107
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,409
and it's very rare that we see people

108
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,290
that actually have to deal with the

109
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,020
internal processes that get involved in

110
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,610
these kinds of digital transformation

111
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,640
discussions so try and do that more

112
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,610
because it's those people that know what

113
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,950
you need and what are most of the pain

114
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,480
points in your day-to-day processes if

115
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,310
you don't involve those people in your

116
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,830
digital transformation initiatives

117
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:50,230
you'll end up just wasting money and

118
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:52,090
time also it's very rare that companies

119
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,750
and even some of our customers in their

120
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,109
initial attempts they rarely look at

121
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:02,170
what the what the what their customers

122
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:04,540
actually are able to tell them I asked

123
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,270
your customer what is it in our

124
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,310
relationship that I could do better how

125
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,909
is it that I could serve you and your

126
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:16,330
needs better because that will also tell

127
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,950
me what I need to change internally you

128
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,469
always assume that you're delivering a

129
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,170
perfect solution and if some customer

130
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,420
ends up leaving you it's because they're

131
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:28,570
stupid they don't understand we're doing

132
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:34,630
a perfect job it's dumb that just don't

133
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:37,120
get it we we we did nothing wrong also

134
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,830
when it comes to this whole move to the

135
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,490
cloud thing

136
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,960
there's a lot of times that I've seen

137
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,330
and I've had discussions with people

138
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,948
especially in the IT department well if

139
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,930
everything's gonna move to the cloud

140
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,560
then what am I going to do are they

141
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:56,919
gonna fire me are they it's it's IT guys

142
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,310
it's it's something that you've chosen

143
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,948
knowing full well that stuff changes and

144
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:06,910
we're at a security conference out of

145
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:10,300
everything IT I think security is that

146
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,520
part that has the most changes from one

147
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,970
day to another if you work in

148
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,340
development and you work on framework X

149
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,810
B or and that's like two versions behind

150
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,630
but that's the project that your

151
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:25,330
customer needs you to work on if the

152
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,699
next version of that framework comes up

153
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,770
today it's okay if you don't read

154
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,150
anything about it for six months you'll

155
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:35,229
be okay you'll be fine

156
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:37,690
in security if some particular issue or

157
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:40,659
threat or vulnerability or attack or

158
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,979
zero day shows up today and you don't

159
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,419
know about it you might have to update

160
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:49,300
your resume tomorrow right so you are in

161
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,880
a field where you have to learn new

162
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,860
things and if moving to the cloud

163
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,530
implies you learning new things that's

164
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,930
what you signed up for

165
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,210
like that's IT if if you're not ok with

166
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,639
that if you're not ok to always be

167
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:07,299
up-to-date to always be learning and you

168
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:12,270
want that nice comfy thing then maybe

169
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:14,949
IKEA isn't for you and there's some some

170
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,900
aspects of the startup culture that also

171
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,900
help with this even in larger companies

172
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,359
there's a lot that you can learn from

173
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,669
from startups and it's stuff like rapid

174
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,010
prototyping and fail fast kind of

175
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,260
approaching now when you look at

176
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,319
traditional especially Enterprise

177
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:35,588
infrastructure's it's a lot of stuff

178
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:40,209
that gathered over the years most of it

179
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:44,410
is old out-of-date but you still have to

180
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:47,469
somehow make it work because companies

181
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,439
rarely include the idea of hey I need to

182
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,480
at some point in the future it may be

183
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,750
three years it may be five it may be sev

184
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,520
but at some point in the future I will

185
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,650
have someone in the company come tell me

186
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,510
hey you know my seven-year-old laptop

187
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:07,870
it's a bit slow right you will get there

188
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,330
and if you haven't put the the simple

189
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,220
idea that you have to budget for

190
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,900
hardware and software licenses and

191
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,450
everything that you need for your

192
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,900
business to run and you don't put that

193
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:22,120
into your business plan and you end up

194
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,550
being surprised every seven years that

195
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,690
you have to renew licenses and buy new

196
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,930
servers and stuff

197
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,640
then you're not doing your business

198
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,160
right you're not considering all the

199
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,110
costs that you have and this is the kind

200
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,870
of pain point that a lot of companies

201
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,150
find there's a lot of tech products that

202
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,740
you need to choose from a lot of demands

203
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,750
coming from the market and your

204
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,370
competition is doing cool stuff and

205
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,340
you're not doing it and you feel like

206
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,590
you're missing out so you just buy stuff

207
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,480
for the sake of buying it because it's

208
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,280
cool because it sounds cool because the

209
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,440
marketing slides for it were cool

210
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,230
because the sales guy that pitched that

211
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,020
product or service to you was they did a

212
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,730
good job but you end up realizing that

213
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,780
hey this is not actually what I need

214
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:09,400
what I want or what can help me so why

215
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,400
would you then move to the cloud right

216
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:16,360
why would you pick the cloud well the

217
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,630
thing is this is not today's real

218
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,200
question if you look at the industry

219
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:27,730
today companies are already in the cloud

220
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,640
and the their main concerns is how do I

221
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,860
move more stuff to the cloud and how do

222
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,960
i optimize what's already there because

223
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,480
I haven't really thought things through

224
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,310
from the very beginning so I moved a

225
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,090
bunch of stuff and now I end up seeing

226
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:45,579
that it's my invoice is 3x VMR I was

227
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:49,150
expecting or the amount the consultant

228
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:52,150
told me before we move to the cloud so I

229
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:54,760
want to optimize the cost but I also

230
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:57,970
want to move more stuff there and that's

231
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,790
the the current trends in the industry

232
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,120
it's not should I move to the cloud is

233
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:06,189
the cloud there's value in the cloud you

234
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,820
just have to figure out what that value

235
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,010
for you and do it right from the very

236
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,800
beginning so why would you do it or why

237
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,990
do companies actually do it mainly it

238
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,880
has to do with cost control and this is

239
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,860
where a lot of stuff fails from the very

240
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,620
beginning you just think of hey I'm live

241
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:28,060
I want to move my cheap server from

242
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,650
hetner to the cloud be it AWS Roger or

243
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,869
whatever and you end up looking at the

244
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,569
bill at the end of the month and you say

245
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,670
hey this is much more expensive but

246
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,580
that's because you don't actually make

247
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:42,280
use of what the cloud can provide which

248
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,860
is that commodity thing that being able

249
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,959
to turn things on and off and only pay

250
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,930
for stuff when you use them as opposed

251
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,300
to a server that sits under your desk or

252
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:55,180
a dedicated server co-located somewhere

253
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,479
in a data center with the cloud you have

254
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:01,989
that turn-on turnoff kind of thing like

255
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,060
tap water you turn on the tap water

256
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,350
flows you are not paying for it at the

257
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,510
end of the month when you turn off the

258
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:11,890
tap you stop paying paying for it like

259
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:15,160
electricity or anything that's on demand

260
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:18,520
if you can do that if you can figure out

261
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,459
those kinds of workloads that have an

262
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,189
odd pattern they work like an on-and-off

263
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,920
thing you have the application that

264
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,660
generates your payroll that runs once a

265
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,459
month when you have to pay the salaries

266
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,680
and that's one day a month that it

267
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,750
crunches numbers for all the employees

268
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,510
in the company and then for the rest of

269
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,780
the 29 30 days of the month it just sits

270
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:43,569
there idly or with very little resources

271
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,400
needed but you still allocate the same

272
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,410
amount of hardware for the entire month

273
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,490
because that thing needs to be running

274
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,180
right

275
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:55,330
what if someone needs to generate one of

276
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,550
the payrolls three days later but if you

277
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,950
have these kinds of workloads you can

278
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,140
easily scale them up and down you can

279
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:05,320
easily turn them off maybe during nights

280
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:08,050
and weekends will there be someone

281
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,930
generating payrolls on a Saturday at 3

282
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,939
a.m. if yes then maybe there are some

283
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,280
other processes inside the company that

284
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,839
you need to look at if no maybe you can

285
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,140
just turn off that machine and stop

286
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,510
paying for it innovation

287
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,209
the cloud is also the place where you

288
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,490
find certain solutions that it's really

289
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:29,529
hard to build yourself like AI and

290
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,890
machine learning and different ways to

291
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,240
work with databases and storage

292
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,579
databases that spread across multiple

293
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,230
regions and multiple data centers and

294
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:42,579
they allow you to have this distributed

295
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,029
deployment of an application with data

296
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:47,349
available in any region of the world

297
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,500
building that kind of an infrastructure

298
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,140
yourself I'm not saying it's impossible

299
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:57,000
but it might be slightly more expensive

300
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:59,350
than just paying per use to use that and

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,110
have that being built by somebody else

302
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,940
by the cloud provider also if you're

303
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,390
just starting up as a business it makes

304
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,220
a lot more sense to just use software as

305
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,040
a service as much as possible for your

306
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:16,120
email for your CRM or ERP solutions and

307
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,069
not have to install and configure and

308
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,100
manage them on Prem because you need

309
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,310
dedicated stuff to do that as opposed to

310
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,800
having a SAS solution that just is

311
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:29,500
available and you pay based on the

312
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,529
number of people in your company and of

313
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,029
course and the talk that we're here

314
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:38,589
today the security and compliance side

315
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:40,329
now the challenges around the cloud fall

316
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,029
into a lot of categories and I'm not

317
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:45,760
gonna go into a lot of detail here but

318
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:47,350
it's mostly about identity and data like

319
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,970
how do you do data classification how do

320
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,500
you do labeling how do you protect your

321
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,839
data especially once it's in the cloud

322
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,660
how do you monitor and respond to

323
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,180
threats when your stuff is in the cloud

324
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,219
and not under your desk how do you

325
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,890
handle geography like multi geo

326
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,350
deployments and gdpr cuz that's a thing

327
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,390
for a while now and fines have started

328
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,649
to come in so that's starting to become

329
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:14,500
a thing again

330
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:17,350
there was the really high panic before

331
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,779
gdpr kicked in and there were silence

332
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,360
for like a year but now that the fines

333
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:24,070
have started to come in people are

334
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,750
starting to ask about so what's the deal

335
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,850
with this gdpr thing again what is it

336
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:31,029
that we need to do not to get that fine

337
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:33,520
that the other guys got then you have to

338
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,089
look at the financials like operating

339
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,309
expand

340
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:39,129
or capital expenditure understanding the

341
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:41,290
billing models or what are your

342
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:43,569
constants and variables when it comes to

343
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,339
cloud consumption and you need to apply

344
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:47,290
the relevant tools to be able to see

345
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:49,059
that to have that transparently visible

346
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,219
to you and then there's a governance

347
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:54,579
discussion which is a whole thing in

348
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:58,240
itself cloud any cloud subscription can

349
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:59,649
and will and does get very messy unless

350
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,199
you have proper governance from the

351
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:04,209
get-go you start giving people access to

352
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:06,490
hey just use that cloud subscription and

353
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:08,859
create whatever you want just make sure

354
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,809
to may be deleted when you're done the

355
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,269
may be deleted when you're done part

356
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:15,639
people usually forget if it's not their

357
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:18,970
credit card on file people usually

358
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,620
forget the guy that ends up paying the

359
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,189
bill at the end of the month he'll

360
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,350
notice he'll notice that huge sequel

361
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:28,990
server machine that you test it for two

362
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,509
hours and left running for a month he'll

363
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,309
see it on the bill and then there's

364
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:37,089
processes and the way that you change

365
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:39,399
those internally now moving to the cloud

366
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:41,860
is usually a matter of just doing an

367
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,920
assessment what is it that I want to do

368
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,779
what is it I want to move and why and

369
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,959
then you need to figure out how you do

370
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:51,790
it and once you're there you have to

371
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,849
look at maybe potentially optimizing

372
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,498
stuff once it's there and I'm not sure

373
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,860
how many of you are familiar with the

374
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:04,149
R's of migration you've probably heard

375
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:06,789
about notes of some hands so this is a

376
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:09,668
way to look at how do I move staff to

377
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:11,740
the cloud like we host it's just lift

378
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:14,199
and shift you get your virtual machine

379
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,870
from on-prem you move it to the cloud

380
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,089
you don't make any changes probably it's

381
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:22,750
gonna get another IP but that's it it

382
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:25,029
just runs refactor is when you may have

383
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,609
to make some small changes to your

384
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:29,350
application to your workload to make it

385
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:30,668
work in the cloud or make it work better

386
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,469
for you like for instance you're not

387
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:35,380
using sequel server in a dedicated

388
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:38,770
virtual machine you're using sequel as a

389
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,090
service in the cloud right it's just a

390
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,799
matter of changing that connection

391
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,510
string inside your application and

392
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,370
somehow migrating or importing the

393
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,770
database somewhere else but it's a minor

394
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,290
change revising

395
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:53,950
usually involves extensive modifications

396
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,930
to the code in order to be able to

397
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,030
deploy it in an environment that needs

398
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,540
to scale horizontally or vertically if

399
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:06,730
like you have an application that has

400
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:08,620
stateful sessions it's gonna be hard to

401
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,710
scale that horizontally and have servers

402
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,810
pop in dot if you have it stateless and

403
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,640
you find another way to keep the state

404
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,409
somewhere else the moment the server

405
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,200
goes down it doesn't take all the

406
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,210
sessions running there on the web server

407
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,370
with it so you might have to make some

408
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,580
modifications to account for this new

409
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:30,639
architecture rebuilding is actually

410
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,889
doing it from scratch you've thought

411
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,280
about this architecture 10-15 years ago

412
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:38,920
it might not be cloud ready so you might

413
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,830
have to just do it from scratch that's a

414
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,070
solution in some cases or you might have

415
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:47,649
to just replace it just switch that

416
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,110
local exchange server for instance with

417
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,700
office 365 just to give an example it's

418
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,490
still exchanged but it's somebody else

419
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,310
managing it right so you just replace it

420
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,710
with a solution or in some other cases

421
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,460
you might just realize I don't need this

422
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,530
anymore

423
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,500
i I really don't there's better

424
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,780
alternatives out there I will just let

425
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,610
this app but this workload let the

426
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,300
solution drop and just move to whatever

427
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,770
I need now when you get to the cloud

428
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,409
people think oh I've moved to the cloud

429
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,090
so now the cloud provider manages some

430
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,600
stuff for me so I don't have to bother

431
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:25,240
anymore that's not true you still have

432
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,490
to bother about some things and you can

433
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,310
see that in some cases those things

434
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,050
based on where you are whether it's

435
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,990
infrastructure platform or software as a

436
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:37,389
service it may vary by service type what

437
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,580
you need to do what the cloud provider

438
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:43,210
needs to do what you need to work on

439
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,120
together and there's some some stuff

440
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,820
that you still have a hundred percent

441
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,260
control and responsibility over like how

442
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,510
you do your data classification and

443
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,240
governance and how do you manage your

444
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:57,490
endpoint protection for the clients for

445
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,410
the devices for the laptops or the

446
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,450
phones that connect the stuff in the

447
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,429
cloud that's still on you

448
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,950
you might use cloud solutions for that

449
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:08,639
but that's still on you and there's a

450
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,899
bunch of triggers that end up causing

451
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:13,360
customers and people to move to the

452
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:15,580
cloud I'm not going to go into all of

453
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,678
these but there's there's a lot of

454
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,389
different reasons on why you want to

455
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,409
move to the cloud and why you might want

456
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:24,219
to move to the cloud

457
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:26,649
now instead of next year once you and

458
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,840
figure out that hey I have to move to

459
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:31,779
the cloud you figure that hey what I

460
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:35,470
want to go deeper things start to get

461
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:38,500
more fun like things like applications

462
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,960
those are a lot more interesting than

463
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,139
just moving servers around because

464
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,149
changing the the like revising reaaargh

465
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:47,860
attacking an application usually means

466
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:51,549
you have to deal with some of the stuff

467
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:53,559
on the slide and you have to deal with

468
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:55,059
them because they show up in the cloud

469
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,889
and they might not have been relevant

470
00:20:55,059 --> 00:21:01,360
when that application was running on a

471
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:04,178
single server where you solve the the

472
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,908
performance issue by just throwing more

473
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:11,200
hardware at the server the app is slow

474
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:14,409
just add another stick of RAM just

475
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,990
change the CPU now it's fast again it's

476
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:19,149
not the developers problem know that the

477
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:22,230
code is perfect it's the hardware that's

478
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:25,360
at fault so just add more hardware

479
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:27,639
performance issues fixed when you go to

480
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,289
the cloud there's a whole bunch of stuff

481
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:33,850
that people just fail to to look at now

482
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:36,340
when it comes to the security and

483
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,129
compliance side of things by getting to

484
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,769
the cloud this is where things get a lot

485
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:44,019
more complicated and people in companies

486
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:45,850
usually shy away from that like now I

487
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:50,169
don't want to have this discussion today

488
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:51,760
like maybe tomorrow maybe if we find

489
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:53,260
time for it at some point in the future

490
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,169
and the budget for it

491
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,480
maybe but let's let's just discuss how

492
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:01,149
we get stuff there and then then maybe

493
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,480
we'll discuss security now when it comes

494
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:06,309
to security controls just like before

495
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,590
there's a lot of things that you still

496
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:11,049
need to account for that you will have

497
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,389
to handle anything dealing with your

498
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,429
security strategy your data governance

499
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:17,019
that's still on you

500
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:19,269
regardless of what sort of cloud

501
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:22,179
solutions you use you're still so you do

502
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:24,039
it you do everything on Prem but in the

503
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:27,009
cloud you still have to do a whole bunch

504
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:30,639
of these things anything involving

505
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:33,249
defending against loss of control that's

506
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:36,309
still on you anything protecting your

507
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:38,669
data because it's your data it's not the

508
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:41,080
cloud providers job to protect your data

509
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:43,690
how you do it it's still your job

510
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,789
whether it's under your desk or it's in

511
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,070
the cloud you still have to care about

512
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:50,469
that and figure things out how do you

513
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,769
use maybe you can use some of the stuff

514
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:55,599
that the cloud provider gives you to

515
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:57,759
make your life easier

516
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,168
user identity divided security just the

517
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,789
same and then when you go into the

518
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,259
platform and infrastructure as a service

519
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,690
you still have the application security

520
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:06,519
and the network side of things and in

521
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,779
the infrastructure as a service side

522
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:12,190
whether the VM is in your data center or

523
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:16,479
it's in the cloud you still have to do

524
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:20,739
the patching the monitoring for any any

525
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:25,330
security issues right how many of you

526
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:29,440
are familiar with GRC all right so

527
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:31,658
that's about 5% of the room that's

528
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,489
that's good I mean you're here to learn

529
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:36,639
about new stuff so hopefully you'll hear

530
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:40,210
about at least some new stuff GRC is

531
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:42,728
that combination of governance risk

532
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,950
management and compliance it's something

533
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:48,759
it's it's part of those things that you

534
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:51,149
should be doing but you rarely do or you

535
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:56,169
rarely do properly

536
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:59,168
the goals of GRC is to help ensure that

537
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:03,669
any organization meets its business

538
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:06,309
objectives and it more often than not it

539
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:10,029
has to do with technology there's very

540
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:13,119
few companies out there that don't need

541
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:15,339
technology at least even if it's just

542
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,289
the website and your email address you

543
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:19,479
still have to work with technology and

544
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:22,960
it might be an essential part of your

545
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:25,539
business how many of you would say that

546
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,080
my business would be affected if my

547
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:34,989
email was down for one day

548
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:36,428
okay one week one month oh wow there's a

549
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:39,100
lot of people not using email in the

550
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:42,249
room or a lot of people just too lazy to

551
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,559
raise their hands so there's some

552
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:46,570
components some technology out there

553
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,029
that's critical to you and running your

554
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:51,149
business the goals of GRC is to try and

555
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:53,230
keep the risk at an acceptable level

556
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:54,039
make sure that those things are

557
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,619
available

558
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:59,019
make sure you comply to any laws and

559
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:01,959
regulations especially with the way they

560
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:03,970
change and you have to make sure that

561
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,609
you protect both your data and the

562
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:09,850
customers data otherwise you'll get

563
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:12,189
fines right with GD P R now when you

564
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:15,428
look at the items that are in focus with

565
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,980
GRC usually it's stuff around regulatory

566
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:19,659
compliance whether you're doing payment

567
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,869
processing or you're working with the

568
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:24,940
healthcare industry in the US there's

569
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:26,859
something out there that requires you to

570
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,299
go through certain steps and validations

571
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:31,059
to ensure that hey you're doing a good

572
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:33,220
job here there's also data governance

573
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:34,989
anything dealing with data loss

574
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,700
prevention encrypting any personally

575
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:39,609
identifiable information and things like

576
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,799
that financial governance making sure

577
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:44,619
you don't overspend make sure you're

578
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:46,509
still in business next year change

579
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:49,779
management and that's where things like

580
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:52,149
DevOps come in and making efforts to

581
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:54,399
ensure organizational readiness doing

582
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:55,899
trainings like you don't just go in one

583
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:58,869
day and tell people hey you know what

584
00:25:55,899 --> 00:26:02,369
starting today we are not using solution

585
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:05,049
X we're using solution Y good luck and

586
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:07,119
if you're not productive the next week

587
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:09,460
it's your problem it's on you it's not

588
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,709
on us we just changed it to this new

589
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,840
shiny thing that's supposed to do things

590
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,869
a lot better but you're not training

591
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,988
your people to actually use that and

592
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:22,509
there's there's a lot of governance IT

593
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:26,470
framework that could help you like I to

594
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:29,230
land COBIT now the traditional approach

595
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:33,129
when it comes to the cloud usually

596
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:35,049
involves this sort of conflict like you

597
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:36,908
do development and that's not just

598
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,408
software development but just developing

599
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:40,359
your solutions or implementing your

600
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:42,450
solutions and you want these things to

601
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:45,250
be

602
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:48,640
able to be deployed as fast as possible

603
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:51,100
you want if possible instant production

604
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,470
access you want these to just flow

605
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,929
smoothly whenever there's a change you

606
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,820
want it on the website today or the

607
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:01,000
marketing team wants it on the website

608
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:03,250
today so you want those rapid releases

609
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,650
but then there's the IT guys that the

610
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:08,530
bad guys the guys that say no all right

611
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:11,830
whenever you ask for something then not

612
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:12,879
not a new server not not today maybe

613
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,610
next week

614
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,960
wait so they're they're usually the guys

615
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,459
that you go to when you need something

616
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,270
and they're the guys telling you no

617
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,130
right because they have some policies

618
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,320
and they have to deal with security and

619
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:29,350
you're not gonna deal with security it's

620
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,360
not your problem so and you don't care

621
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:35,199
about the cost you just want that thing

622
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,929
today so there's a conflict here and you

623
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,140
it's it's all about the speed and

624
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:42,490
controls kind of things and I I

625
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,240
mentioned I might be giving some

626
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,930
examples around a sure so the way a sure

627
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:52,390
solves this is they started implementing

628
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:55,780
things that can help you get both the

629
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:58,240
speed and control things like using

630
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,920
blueprints and templates and policies

631
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,430
that are predefined doing cost

632
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,410
management so that you can do all those

633
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:08,440
things as fast as possible but still

634
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:10,570
have that level of control and just to

635
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,110
give you an example here usually when

636
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,840
developers or the ops team comes they go

637
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,520
to the cloud custodian whoever that is

638
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,590
it may be a department it may be a

639
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,200
person but they need to ask for more

640
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,330
stuff in the cloud like and that's

641
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,220
usually something that will be visible

642
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,889
on the bill at the end of the month so

643
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:32,950
they have to ask for that and the cloud

644
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:36,100
custodian says hold on we need to assess

645
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:39,010
we need to evaluate we need to compute

646
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,709
the costs and when we say it's okay

647
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,379
we'll let you do it right and that's the

648
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:47,980
more traditional approach with something

649
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:50,200
that's implemented as a process you have

650
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:53,380
these controls these kinds of controls

651
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,450
built-in that you can tweak so that you

652
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,830
can say hey I I want to

653
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:01,870
my people deploy stuff but everyone will

654
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,480
have this sort of a quota they will only

655
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,860
be able to deploy in these regions they

656
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,679
will all be able to deploy these

657
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:11,428
workloads and this many work clothes and

658
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,950
anything that goes above that come to me

659
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:17,200
but just let them do some of it that I

660
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:20,440
might say yes eventually

661
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,289
or even better start planning ahead and

662
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,929
saying hey I I want to be able to allow

663
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:28,990
people to do these things they do today

664
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:31,029
and these extra things anytime they want

665
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,010
and they don't have to ask my permission

666
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:35,559
to do it because we've already budgeted

667
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,000
that and we'll make sure that they're

668
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,490
within the budget because we have the

669
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,820
controls in place to ensure that they

670
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,889
don't go over budget so it's these kinds

671
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,600
of things that you need to look at and

672
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:49,178
how do i implement that how does my

673
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,949
cloud provider allow me to implement

674
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:53,950
these kinds of things to make my life

675
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:56,500
easier then there's what's called third

676
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,480
and fourth third party risk right with

677
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,220
the cloud customers are usually

678
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,380
responsible for implementing security in

679
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,440
the actual application that they deploy

680
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,419
the SAS providers their responsibility

681
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,539
there is possible for security in the

682
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:13,019
cloud and the cloud providers they

683
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:15,879
handle the security of the cloud and

684
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:18,630
they themselves have third-party

685
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:23,110
auditors and maybe some outsource

686
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:26,260
support department in India answering to

687
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:28,330
your tickets and they get to handle your

688
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,370
data for the application that you're

689
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,500
building for a customer so there's a lot

690
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:35,080
of stuff involved here that you need to

691
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,340
account for when making that move it's

692
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,559
no longer under your desk you're

693
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,928
involving some third and fourth parties

694
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,408
into the mix and you have to make sure

695
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:46,990
that they can handle what you throw at

696
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:49,779
them and you can do it in a framework

697
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:51,700
that's clear from a cost standpoint from

698
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:54,940
a legal standpoint from a compliance

699
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,889
standpoint and all of that stuff so just

700
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,659
analyzing the costs and benefits of the

701
00:30:56,889 --> 00:31:01,178
cloud migration that's also a thing and

702
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:04,059
ensuring that once you're there you have

703
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:07,929
the insight that you need building that

704
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:09,040
strategy as sort of like a summary - -

705
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:12,670
this section

706
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,840
is really about understanding your

707
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,640
business challenges

708
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,280
now I've insisted on this a number of

709
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,990
times so far and if it's not clear now

710
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,500
now it's on the slide so you'll get the

711
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:26,340
slide it's it's thinking about whether

712
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:30,010
this thing actually solves my problem

713
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:32,080
does it help me it's not it helps

714
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,850
somebody else so it must help me that's

715
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,010
the wrong way to go that's the digital

716
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,679
transformation that we talked about in

717
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:42,090
the very beginning make sure that

718
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:45,940
whenever you think about this your

719
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:47,800
defense approach is data centric think

720
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,680
about your data that's the essential

721
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,450
stuff regardless of how it's stored how

722
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,670
it's handled how it's processed

723
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:57,670
it's still your data and your workload

724
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,410
so think about those things first and

725
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,060
how do you protect them how do you move

726
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:03,340
them from one place to another what's

727
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,409
the degree of lock-in that you have once

728
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,770
you move how easy can you come back

729
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:10,540
things like that you have to handle this

730
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,550
from a proactive standpoint especially

731
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:15,700
when it comes to risk management and

732
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:18,909
this is this is the stuff that yes I

733
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:21,430
know but it's expensive it takes time

734
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:24,340
and it doesn't provide any real

735
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:27,160
immediate tangible benefits most times

736
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:30,909
so companies end up avoiding this until

737
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:34,030
it's sometimes too late what's I know we

738
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:36,730
have to do backups but maybe tomorrow

739
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:39,580
maybe some other time maybe we don't

740
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,920
need it maybe we're not the beat we're

741
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,470
not gonna be the unlucky ones maybe

742
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,200
maybe maybe and then when that thing

743
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,510
happens that's when you realize oh yeah

744
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,510
well we should have done this from the

745
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:56,230
very beginning so this is just about

746
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:58,540
avoiding that all right and ensuring

747
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:00,010
that continuous approach when it comes

748
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,440
to security and compliance and once you

749
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:06,730
understand those needs once you

750
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:10,450
understand your RTO and RPO your desired

751
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:13,720
RTO and RPO then you can build your

752
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:16,150
strategy around that and you may have to

753
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,730
make sure that you resolve that business

754
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:22,310
challenge that you've just identified

755
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:24,830
because in some cases regardless of what

756
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:28,040
and Microsoft and Google tell you in

757
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:31,520
some cases the cloud is not the answer

758
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,379
in some cases it makes sense for it to

759
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,810
keep stuff on Prem

760
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,660
whether it's compliance whether it's

761
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:41,360
latency whether it's some other reason

762
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:46,070
in some cases the cloud is not the

763
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:48,169
answer so from from my perspective it's

764
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:52,460
not that the cloud is the future

765
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:54,470
the the future is hybrid right now the

766
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:56,570
future is a mix of stuff that you can

767
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,180
run and can move to the cloud and that

768
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:03,260
makes sense and some stuff that will

769
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:05,420
keep running on Prem you it could be

770
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,630
until you migrated or it could be

771
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,850
forever or it could be until you don't

772
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:13,490
need it anymore but it's gonna be

773
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,589
something hybrid and more often than not

774
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:18,169
moving to the cloud it's not something

775
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,390
that a lot of customers ask for so can

776
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:22,250
we do this next Saturday from 2:00 to

777
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:25,219
3:00 a.m. right

778
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:30,860
can we move a thousand VMs and 2,000

779
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:33,560
users next weekend you might be able to

780
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,840
tell that that's not usually the case so

781
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,170
there's gonna be some time interval when

782
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,330
you have stuff running in both sides

783
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,650
when you start resolving that business

784
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,509
challenge you have to secure the data

785
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,910
not the cloud that's somebody else's

786
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,640
problem and we'll talk in a bit about

787
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:51,679
how that problem is handled you have to

788
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,859
manage that risk proactively like I said

789
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,129
and you have to implement that

790
00:34:53,860 --> 00:35:00,380
foundational security and the the

791
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:02,840
starting point needs to be well thought

792
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,340
of you can still change that it's fine

793
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,740
it doesn't have to be the perfect

794
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:12,080
solution from the very beginning but

795
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:15,169
it's it has to be something there's

796
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:19,700
there's a saying that I I like using

797
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:21,950
better done than perfect because if

798
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,220
you'll just wait until you figure

799
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:28,129
everything out it might be too late or

800
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,580
it might be too costly or do I take too

801
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:34,130
long or it might be all of the above and

802
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:35,690
just to give you an example of how some

803
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,200
of these things that I've discussed

804
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,130
about our

805
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,200
handled like I mentioned we mostly deal

806
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,650
with customers doing stuff in the

807
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,680
Microsoft cloud in Azure and office 365

808
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:53,200
when it comes to Azure for one from a

809
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:58,848
compliance standpoint they are like

810
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:01,009
probably the most like compliant cloud

811
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:04,060
provider out there there were the first

812
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:07,010
to get a lot of these things up there as

813
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:08,150
audits external audits saying that hey

814
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,930
these guys are doing a good job

815
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:13,760
protecting your data a certain way and

816
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:17,529
it usually has to do with global or

817
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:22,400
industry vertical specific kind of

818
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:24,470
compliances and certifications you some

819
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,420
of you might be familiar or might

820
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:31,160
actually be working for a company that

821
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:35,240
has one or two or three of these right

822
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:37,970
if you if you need this you will need it

823
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,368
whether it's whether the data stays with

824
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:42,470
you or in the cloud so you need that

825
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,780
cloud provider to be able to provide at

826
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:47,810
least the same amount of trust and

827
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,790
confidence and stuff that's verified by

828
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,859
a third-party and audited that you can

829
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,050
track so any of these things if you move

830
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:56,240
to the Microsoft cloud any of these

831
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:59,240
things you can download the report for

832
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,419
it will tell you who did it when what

833
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:06,529
they found about any of their services

834
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:09,800
so these are these are available when it

835
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:13,310
comes to physical security how many of

836
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,839
you have data in a physical data center

837
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,750
somewhere whether it's privately owned

838
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:19,730
or it's co-located right so there's

839
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,800
there's a bunch of you now looking at

840
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:25,369
the things on the slide and I'm not sure

841
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,980
how much stuff you see in the back how

842
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:29,780
do you handle how is access handle to

843
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,910
that data have you ever been to the data

844
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:36,200
center that you have data in right so

845
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:39,710
most of them have write access approval

846
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:42,770
who gets in does anyone who gets in go

847
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,510
through a background check is there a

848
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:46,550
system check of any kind how do you

849
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,980
handle perimeter security like fencing

850
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,000
and gates and video and stuff like that

851
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,490
how do you handle

852
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,060
to the building do you use biometrics

853
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:57,580
like palm scans and retinal scans and

854
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:02,540
things like that

855
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:04,580
do you have guards like in some cases

856
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:09,770
and I've been to data centers that have

857
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:13,250
guards with guns around right I usually

858
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:16,570
have a customer in in Florida in Miami

859
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:20,720
and they had some servers co-located in

860
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:24,470
think it's nap of the Americas Terra

861
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,080
mark it's the data center that connects

862
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:29,330
South America to North America and about

863
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,049
80% of the traffic between the two goes

864
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:35,180
through that and I think back then it

865
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,580
was seven out of the eleven

866
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,890
backbone providers of the internet

867
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,630
connected there so if the internet

868
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,430
didn't work in that data center it mean

869
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,580
it meant the internet wasn't working

870
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:49,730
basically so besides all the physical

871
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,270
security and protection to tornadoes and

872
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,060
things like that

873
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:54,830
it took us about 15 minutes to get to

874
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,470
the data center from where we were

875
00:38:54,830 --> 00:39:00,830
staying and about 30 minutes to get to

876
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:02,899
our rack because of all the security

877
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,790
controls and all the processes that we

878
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:08,270
had to undergo and once we were there

879
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:10,580
that's where the US government Verisign

880
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:12,560
Google and others had their servers as

881
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:15,348
well so once you got into the room and

882
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,170
you got to your rack you could see at

883
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:20,180
like about this high there were

884
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,400
platforms all around with guys with

885
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,290
semi-automated guns patrolling and

886
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,730
looking at you whether you use your key

887
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:32,210
for the right rack right so if you have

888
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:34,910
that then yes your data is secure if you

889
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:37,849
have all of this stuff underneath your

890
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:40,399
desk then yes your email is more secure

891
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:43,099
there and you don't have to bother about

892
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:46,130
it yep I might want to move to the cloud

893
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:48,980
because you have that right and it costs

894
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,020
next to nothing when it comes to

895
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:54,640
infrastructure this is some of the stuff

896
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:57,440
that the cloud provider does for you and

897
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,170
it's not just a sure most of the others

898
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,170
do most of the same things they just

899
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,810
call them different names and in some

900
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:07,620
cases

901
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:09,120
call them different names that are so

902
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,650
different from anything that you've ever

903
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,080
worked on that if you don't know what

904
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:15,330
you search for you will not know where

905
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,460
where you can find the containers or the

906
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:20,330
VMS or the networking or the identity

907
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:23,670
because it's called some fancy name but

908
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:26,430
most of these things the cloud providers

909
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:29,130
end up doing for you if you do these

910
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:32,100
things yourself in your network in your

911
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:34,980
infrastructure again you can claim at

912
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:38,730
any time of day yes I am safe I am as

913
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:42,630
safe as the cloud right so I can still

914
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:44,910
keep my data here networking just the

915
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:48,150
same as long as you do some of these

916
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,740
things or all of these things then you

917
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,770
can sleep better at night knowing that

918
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,689
hey you know these guys the Microsoft

919
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:56,790
guys they're doing a shitty job with

920
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,860
security in their data center they

921
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:01,490
should come and all I'll teach them how

922
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:04,140
security is really done right and

923
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:07,799
there's also data security and these are

924
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:10,859
some of the most specific solutions that

925
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,100
Microsoft does provide like role based

926
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:16,020
access control and the transparent data

927
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,960
encryption or always encrypted settings

928
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,090
in sequel server or their key management

929
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,670
systems other cloud providers have their

930
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:26,670
own this one's called key vault so you

931
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:29,940
need to have something similar and in

932
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:35,190
most cases you do most cases but most

933
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:37,200
cases I mean Amazon right because when

934
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:39,300
it comes to the the range of offerings

935
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,089
if you look at the the big three

936
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,400
providers Google is still behind on a

937
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:46,890
lot of things they're ahead on some

938
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,330
others but they're the ones that don't

939
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:54,060
have a why does offer an offering as

940
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:56,759
Amazon and Microsoft do but where'd they

941
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,220
have them they're quite the same it's

942
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,890
like 10 years ago people were discussing

943
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,589
what hypervisor is the best the fastest

944
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,810
and that's no longer the case if you

945
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:11,190
compare performance on a hypervisor and

946
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:13,380
you see 50 percent differences then

947
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,090
that's a problem that's not being a

948
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,280
problem for for a number of years now

949
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,460
it's the same with the cloud you have

950
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,790
equivalence

951
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,500
Lucian's with other providers as well

952
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:28,770
I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on

953
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:33,750
this slide but this you can find there's

954
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:35,400
a link up there AKMs slash and CRA the

955
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,680
Microsoft cybersecurity reference

956
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,349
architecture this is something that they

957
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,290
put out every now and then showing how

958
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:46,230
all their products end up working

959
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:48,119
together from a security standpoint so

960
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,650
you just need that link up there and

961
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,230
you'll get the latest version from there

962
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:54,359
there it works is they give you this and

963
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:57,480
this might be overwhelming at first so

964
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:59,700
they have a version that goes like step

965
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,290
by step like you start with your on-prem

966
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,868
data center and you've got some servers

967
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:06,150
there some internet and extranet you've

968
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:08,790
got some clients that you need to manage

969
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,170
like the OSS and devices then maybe

970
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:12,270
you've got your security operating

971
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:15,619
center with your science solution and

972
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:18,570
some automation maybe you do some DLP

973
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:21,270
right and maybe you handle your

974
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:23,790
information your identity with Active

975
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:25,920
Directory and probably you're using

976
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:28,740
something like Dropbox or Google or

977
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,900
Salesforce or box or office 365 as a

978
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,560
third party software as-a-service thing

979
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,180
and probably you have some IOT so this

980
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,880
is where you start and this is where

981
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:42,450
they start showing you how their stuff

982
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,670
comes in hybrid right it's in the middle

983
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:47,279
of the slide I told you the stuff about

984
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,650
hybrid you think about hey let's do this

985
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,000
with Azure so how do you do it well you

986
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,310
look at things like Compliance Manager

987
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and des DL and the trust Center that's

988
00:43:53,310 --> 00:44:00,270
where you find all the reports for the

989
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,940
compliance that I told you about then

990
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:04,020
you start using some stuff around as

991
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,810
your firewall and some security

992
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,880
appliances and you build things into the

993
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:11,810
security center and there's more stuff

994
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,460
that can help you there then you look at

995
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:16,200
having stuff on prem like using the

996
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,880
latest version of windows server that

997
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,950
has some security features and using

998
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,550
Windows 10 that has some features as

999
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:26,580
well that can help then you build your

1000
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:28,740
privileged access workstation access to

1001
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:31,140
ensure that stuff goes there then you

1002
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:34,680
maybe extend your identity into

1003
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,598
as ER ad and you have a bunch of stuff

1004
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,118
there you handle that through

1005
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:42,539
conditional access to connect to stuff

1006
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,390
and then you keep adding and again you

1007
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:47,190
can study everything on the slide when

1008
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:49,739
you get this when you download this has

1009
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:52,039
a hover thing that takes you to a link

1010
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:55,019
somewhere so you can find out more about

1011
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:56,880
more about all of that then when it

1012
00:44:55,019 --> 00:45:00,930
comes to office 365 you've got a bunch

1013
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,749
of stuff going on there it's it's really

1014
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:07,649
well worth looking into so that's that's

1015
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:10,618
the link that you can find it at Amazon

1016
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,869
as far as I know they've tried to do

1017
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:16,440
something similar and I don't think they

1018
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:20,430
did a good of a job as this to just give

1019
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:24,779
you that one single pane of glass view

1020
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:27,149
for their entire offering now when it

1021
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:31,440
comes on I'm just gonna spend like two

1022
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:35,339
more minutes when it comes to how do we

1023
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,079
do it how do we handle this because it's

1024
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:39,900
a challenge that we see with a lot of

1025
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,569
our customers for us it was an iterative

1026
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:47,849
process for us it was it took us a

1027
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:51,900
number of years actually to reach what

1028
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:53,759
we now have as an internal process that

1029
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:57,329
goes through several stages in helping

1030
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:58,920
customers get to the cloud and out of

1031
00:45:57,329 --> 00:46:00,779
the stuff that I told you about this is

1032
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,029
where it fits like you have the cloud

1033
00:46:00,779 --> 00:46:05,489
strategy that you help the customer

1034
00:46:03,029 --> 00:46:07,710
build that cloud strategy from the very

1035
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:10,410
beginning we don't do anything without

1036
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:12,720
going through that first and then once

1037
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,308
we figure that thing out we figure what

1038
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,450
we need to move and how we need to move

1039
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:21,779
it this is usually more of a one-time

1040
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:24,299
project kind of thing the strategy part

1041
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:27,690
is ongoing but then everything else is

1042
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:30,960
you only move things once usually if you

1043
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:34,380
do it right and if you think about it

1044
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,059
right but once you're there there's that

1045
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,920
part that we call peace of mind of the

1046
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,470
service which is mostly about proactive

1047
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,710
support and optimizations and all the

1048
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,640
stuff that yes you know you have to do

1049
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,799
but you rarely

1050
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,279
do it because more often than not the

1051
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:52,799
business of our customers is not cloud

1052
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:55,049
it's something else and the cloud just

1053
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:58,288
helps them so since this is not your

1054
00:46:55,049 --> 00:47:00,329
main business and your main concern yes

1055
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:02,789
you don't have to bother about this

1056
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:05,630
yourself but you have to find someone

1057
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:08,220
who can bother about this for you

1058
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:11,430
so it's it's not okay to not bother

1059
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:13,919
about it at all and just let it go

1060
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:16,740
and then there's ways to find out about

1061
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,960
how do we build a new solutions new

1062
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:24,419
technologies new workloads and how do we

1063
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:28,380
build upon what you you've found there's

1064
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:30,359
a lot of similar things out there that

1065
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:33,559
can help you but the important thing is

1066
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:36,269
you have to have sort of this vision

1067
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:39,779
initially that tells you this is how I

1068
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:41,879
want to do things and you don't take the

1069
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:43,710
first step until you've at least cleared

1070
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,269
out some of the questions and some of

1071
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:48,059
the things that you know you might want

1072
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:50,538
to fix or address or implement or

1073
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:56,599
improve and then you start working now

1074
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:59,880
wrapping up we briefly discussed about

1075
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:03,539
why when and how to move to the cloud

1076
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:06,119
some of the concerns that companies and

1077
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:08,579
people face once they're there and we've

1078
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:11,190
gone through some examples of like how

1079
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:12,690
asher does it for instance when it comes

1080
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:15,599
to physical security and some of the

1081
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:17,099
solutions there if there's something

1082
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,740
that i want you to leave the room today

1083
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:22,200
with the first step ensure you have a

1084
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:24,000
clearer cloud strategy before you do

1085
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,649
anything and that includes security and

1086
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,039
governance but that's part of the bigger

1087
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:31,519
strategy right it's not just hey now I

1088
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,750
have to deal with security it's

1089
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,240
something separate from everything else

1090
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:38,279
it's not it's embedded in everything

1091
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,828
else and you need to address it and

1092
00:48:38,279 --> 00:48:42,839
treat it as such then you have to

1093
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:44,599
discover what you've got right now and

1094
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:47,730
where you're actually starting from

1095
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:50,279
right and don't forget most of the times

1096
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:52,259
you're just extending whatever it is you

1097
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:55,200
do now to the cloud so if you're doing a

1098
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:57,569
poor job right now you will be doing a

1099
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,129
poor job right now both on premon in the

1100
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:00,470
cloud

1101
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:03,380
that's not gonna change unless you

1102
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:05,359
change something about it and it's it's

1103
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,369
going to be in both places if you're if

1104
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:10,279
it's a mess right now the cloud is not

1105
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:12,410
gonna fix that for you the cloud is not

1106
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:14,119
gonna fix your mess you have to fix your

1107
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:16,220
mess and ideally before you move to the

1108
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,559
cloud and then you have to consider all

1109
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:21,890
the details all the fine prints about

1110
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:24,670
costs and geographies and financials and

1111
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:28,460
identity management and things like that

1112
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:36,109
so I still have I think two minutes for

1113
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:40,660
questions one two questions I will take

1114
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:40,660
my computer off so the next speaker can

1115
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,189
okay

1116
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:05,930
thank you very much well your

1117
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:08,660
presentation was almost all about the

1118
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:10,910
fact that solution in most cases are

1119
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,430
more secure than on prime solution yes

1120
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:15,890
and i perfectly agree with that the

1121
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:18,019
problem is I work as a consultant and my

1122
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:21,379
typical customer doesn't agree with that

1123
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:25,609
and that's because is the simply afraid

1124
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:29,299
of losing control on the data because my

1125
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:30,828
data center may be antsy for sure it's

1126
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:33,079
not secure eyes across at the data

1127
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:37,609
center but it's mine I have control on

1128
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:40,119
my stuff and what would you say to a

1129
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:43,009
customer or a partner or someone that

1130
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:45,499
want to be sure to have the same kind of

1131
00:50:43,009 --> 00:50:47,119
control on their data we're moving to

1132
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:48,979
the cloud so we propose instant

1133
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,009
technical solution or something yeah so

1134
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:53,779
I would start by actually trying to find

1135
00:50:52,009 --> 00:50:56,329
what it is that I'm trying to fix for

1136
00:50:53,779 --> 00:50:58,219
them if they don't have a problem right

1137
00:50:56,329 --> 00:50:59,900
now with security and they're okay with

1138
00:50:58,219 --> 00:51:02,269
that and it's gonna be hard for me to

1139
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,249
convince them otherwise it's it's like

1140
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:06,769
trying to force your lady to cross the

1141
00:51:04,249 --> 00:51:10,098
street right you you don't want that you

1142
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:11,930
want to help help them fix something and

1143
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:13,940
in most cases this can

1144
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:16,279
little thing let's just let's not move

1145
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,710
everything to the cloud let's just do

1146
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,650
this pilot let's just let me show you

1147
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:24,320
let me do a one day training to show you

1148
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:27,170
how the cloud works and then let's take

1149
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,660
the least critical of your workloads and

1150
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:32,240
have your people move it to the cloud

1151
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:35,210
just to see how easy it is and once it's

1152
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,490
there just let it run for two weeks and

1153
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:40,310
you'll see that you're still in control

1154
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:42,169
the data is still yours so it's it's all

1155
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:44,750
about baby steps and it's about

1156
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:46,670
identifying an actual problem that you

1157
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,710
can solve for the customer that's how

1158
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,690
you gain their trust and you can do it

1159
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:52,610
gradually if you want to do everything

1160
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:54,170
from the very beginning yeah you have to

1161
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,150
move everything to the cloud you're

1162
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,860
doing it wrong because of that very

1163
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,680
reason because they don't they still

1164
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,510
don't trust the cloud and security and I

1165
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,910
feel it's safer if it's under my desk

1166
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:07,130
but starting with those small steps

1167
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:09,140
they'll gain that trust and it's gonna

1168
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:11,780
be easier and easier to move more and

1169
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:15,650
more stuff and during that time it'll be

1170
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:16,810
hybrid right so I guess one more

1171
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:20,000
question

1172
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:22,690
thank you for your representation all

1173
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:27,320
right when you are dealing with clients

1174
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:28,820
with regard to security do you ever does

1175
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,230
it ever happen that you're in conflict

1176
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:35,600
with internal teams

1177
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:37,910
oh oh yes and not only that but more

1178
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:41,150
often than not we're the ones doing well

1179
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:44,930
it's I hate to say but it's sort of like

1180
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:47,390
herding cats I it's having to deal with

1181
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:49,730
multiple internal departments that don't

1182
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:51,950
usually talk to one another themselves

1183
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:53,690
and you have to make them talk to one

1184
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:55,549
another and you have to make them all

1185
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:57,800
talk to you and you have to make them

1186
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:01,150
understand why this will help them and

1187
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:04,370
this will help them usually its IT and

1188
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:06,590
development and they don't they hate

1189
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:09,470
each other more often than not and when

1190
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:12,050
you want to implement for instance see

1191
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:13,430
ICD solutions right continuous

1192
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,680
integration continuous delivery that's a

1193
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:18,049
lot of DevOps that's a lot of developers

1194
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,140
working with infrastructure guys to make

1195
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:24,320
something work together right so yes

1196
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,080
there's challenges around that it

1197
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,210
doesn't

1198
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,850
have to do is technology unfortunately

1199
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,830
it has to do with your people skills and

1200
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:33,810
your ability to talk to people and

1201
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:37,200
understand their problems and help them

1202
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:39,360
fix it and there's no magical solution

1203
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,879
or technology out there that will save

1204
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:44,040
you from this this is and rule forever

1205
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,560
be an in comfortable position to be in

1206
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,480
but you have to assume that you have to

1207
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,840
assume that this will happen and you

1208
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,140
have to just go with that because it

1209
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,580
will happen and in a lot of cases it's

1210
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,370
hard to make the customer understand

1211
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:02,310
that they need this you will be the one

1212
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:05,390
doing it for them or just doing that

1213
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:08,820
initial change so in a lot of cases a

1214
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:11,580
cloud migration project ends up being

1215
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:15,030
something that transforms their internal

1216
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:17,910
business processes just because they

1217
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:20,190
move something to the cloud means at the

1218
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:22,440
end of this they are doing things

1219
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,760
differently internally they communicate

1220
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,000
differently they handle things

1221
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,020
differently and it's part of that and as

1222
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,640
long as you understand that it's not

1223
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,060
just about technology that it's also

1224
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:35,430
about cultural transformation and

1225
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:39,420
governance and things like internal

1226
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:42,799
processes then that's when you can just

1227
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:45,120
go all in but it's it's more than just

1228
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,680
offering the right technology and making

1229
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,730
sure that they understand and they get

1230
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:54,230
it and they accept it thank you right

1231
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:54,230
thank you to the door for awesome talk
