thanks for being here I always do love

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,519
coming to deaf camp this is my legal

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,809
disclaimer I always I'm not a lawyer but

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,200
I've played one on the internet

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,268
successfully before so when I talk about

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,759
things that I go on this talk where I'm

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,529
like I did this or I Rob this or I lied

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,420
to this person you're gonna be like well

9
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,029
that's really horrible Jason remember

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,890
the kittens I'm adorable okay I will not

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,570
try to steal from you kill you or ruin

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,269
you financially unless you pay me first

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,130
there's always a contract so when I get

14
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,390
to those points at anytime during the

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,280
talk it's like you know please

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,230
understand that another disclaimer

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,140
because I've had people comment on it

18
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,569
they'll you'll see a lot of themes in my

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,600
talk this talks but a lot of examples

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm using are the failings of different

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,860
US government agencies and I'm not

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,110
trying to say that the government

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,430
agencies are bad I'm just saying that

24
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,329
they're really good at giving bad

25
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,649
examples of what to do it's like so

26
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:59,820
that's the reason why I'm doing that so

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,559
hopefully they don't think offense

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,850
because you know I like actually being

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,119
able to make it through the border and

30
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,070
get back home so and when you see the

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,689
talk here you're gonna be like oh yeah

32
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,229
he's right that's a little iffy on him

33
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:16,500
now so please bear with me on that as

34
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,830
well so the name of the talk is I pony i

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,439
pony not basically it's the top three

36
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,820
things I love for my victims I'm sorry

37
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,770
target clients to do it's like because

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,289
it makes it easier for me to rob them or

39
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,449
the top three things that I hate for

40
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,270
them to do because it makes it harder

41
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,560
for me to rob them and then after I tell

42
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,360
you these stories and tell you about

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,979
these examples then we're going to ask

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,960
some questions that you can take back to

45
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,899
your enterprise to help make you better

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,350
secure more security conscious in your

47
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,240
company so a little bit about me you may

48
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,970
have known me from the National

49
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,919
Geographic where you got to watch me rob

50
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,479
a bank in Beirut or you may see me in

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,770
the news actually that one right there

52
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,490
in the upper right hand is actually me

53
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,649
at deaf camp a couple years ago or you

54
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,719
may have seen me most importantly this

55
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:10,210
picture here is the best ones these are

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,450
actually me robbing people this is in

57
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,220
whoa as well got there this is a hotel

58
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,160
in the South of France I've been the

59
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,780
underground area I robbed this place

60
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,510
barefoot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

61
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,760
pajama bottoms and a t-shirt which was

62
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,280
really cool five-star hotel they

63
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,109
provided the hotel keys master keys and

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,180
an unlocked workstation in the back

65
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,660
office area so really recommend that

66
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,390
hotel but not with your data this is me

67
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,549
actually getting an employee to get out

68
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,260
of his desk so I could compromise his

69
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,990
machine while he was standing next to me

70
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,850
but my favorite is this is an actual

71
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:50,710
machine that I took off of a teller

72
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,390
behind the teller line I was rude I

73
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,760
didn't even say hello I just walked in

74
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,589
behind the telephone grab the machine to

75
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,209
unplugged it and then walked out with it

76
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,540
while there was a teller next to me

77
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,280
helping a client so that was fun so

78
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,019
those are what that's what I do but I

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,340
also tried to like would I do these

80
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,980
things it's like I'm trying to educate

81
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,360
not just you know break stuff because I

82
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,280
think it's one of our biggest problems

83
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,600
that we have a lot of people and the the

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,070
red teamers and there's like a lot of

85
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,960
people that come in and they think

86
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,130
they're I'm gonna be Red Team you know

87
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,380
it's like I'm gonna go with like break

88
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,720
stuff in hack stuff we most think of

89
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,859
ourselves like this right it's like you

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,690
know uh purlettes headquarters that's

91
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,760
what it's got to be all about so I got

92
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,410
all these high tech high level you know

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,090
sophisticated attacks it's like

94
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,190
everybody thinks they're like the next

95
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,630
ninja or James Bond going in punching

96
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,430
people in faces and see if they've got

97
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,160
plans it's like one of the stupidest

98
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,040
things I can come across because that

99
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,630
doesn't help your clients that doesn't

100
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,150
help your client at the end of the day

101
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,829
it's like if they don't understand what

102
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,750
the actual threats are real world

103
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,750
scenario then they're not going to take

104
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,820
it seriously you go in and say oh we did

105
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,500
this we did that and we use zero days

106
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,359
and we came in and we like crafted

107
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,540
especially website and they're gonna be

108
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,310
like oh good we're safe they're like how

109
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,320
do you think you're safe I just told you

110
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,000
all this stuff we did yeah but you guys

111
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,160
are like ninjas it's like you're like

112
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,410
sophisticated Jon we don't have to worry

113
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,380
about that it's like so we must be a

114
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,570
fine so I usually do the stuff that's on

115
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,668
the ride over here it's like I literally

116
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,519
just tell people it's like I walked in

117
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,120
and said hello and plug the device in

118
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,448
and

119
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,000
your pone now and that's what's the

120
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:30,160
defense to that there they have to take

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,290
that seriously it's like they have to

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,060
understand it's like I mean trust me

123
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,710
it's like this stuff is so easy even I

124
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,960
can do it and it's like I'll make sure

125
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,120
they understand that it's like there's

126
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,289
no sophistication to my attacks it's

127
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,080
like I've never been accused of being

128
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,270
sophisticated ever so it's like so

129
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,830
that's not a problem so it's like you

130
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,419
have to look at that and you have to see

131
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,000
that that you have to let your clients

132
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:54,130
know that is not just advanced

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,139
techniques they have to protect against

134
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,419
everything people talk about here about

135
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:02,020
zero days all the time you hear zero day

136
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:04,200
this is zero day this 86% of companies

137
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,039
they're compromised was because of a

138
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:11,770
vulnerability that was over a decade old

139
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,930
people who cares about your zero day

140
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:18,039
it's like there's I'm popping boxes with

141
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,139
the 5430 all day it's like that's the

142
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,550
ones you need to be worried about it's

143
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:25,320
like how many people have gotten popped

144
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:30,760
or pop the box or seven with MSO 867

145
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:32,800
that's over ten years old people exactly

146
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,450
it's going to get even older it's like

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,940
so I mean come on it's like we got to

148
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,130
work on those things but we always have

149
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:43,570
a problem in our industry right because

150
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:45,639
our executives they want this it's like

151
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,880
we need this we need all this protection

152
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,320
all these apts we need a bigger firewall

153
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,210
we need to make it bigger we've got to

154
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,950
make cabling T's pay for it or something

155
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,359
like that I think this out goes right

156
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,150
it's like definitely we're always

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,690
talking about and you're like yeah

158
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,549
that's awesome let's build that here's

159
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,550
the budget we're gonna need and they're

160
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,340
like whoa hold on hold on we've got the

161
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,900
budget for what's on the right it's like

162
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,929
you know we're gonna give you this much

163
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,120
money to expect this but we want this so

164
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,950
and I'm like can I get an extra money

165
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,960
just to put a guy on top with a hard hat

166
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,969
or something it's like I mean give me

167
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,400
some safety cones to put around maybe

168
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,020
there I mean what are you gonna do it's

169
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,090
like so we're at that's like so why do

170
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,010
we start actually dedicating some of

171
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,090
that resources and some of that economy

172
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,640
instead of just building better

173
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,979
technology and we start educating our

174
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,840
employees why don't we just start

175
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,270
diverting some that money for all the

176
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,830
big shiny bling I mean I know there's

177
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,390
some blue key box offenders here too and

178
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,979
it's like and blinky boxes are very

179
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,450
important it's like some come with blue

180
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,230
lights now instead of red light so

181
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,880
that's awesome

182
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,140
it's like it I'm sure that it's very

183
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,510
particular but instead of just getting

184
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,950
technology to protect your people we

185
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,849
need to get our people to protect our

186
00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:01,719
technology so one of the first things

187
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,940
that I love I love so much is employees

188
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,100
not empowered or educated to question

189
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,950
the unusual that's amazing

190
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,190
I was literally on a job last week in

191
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,780
Boston and I did this engagement and it

192
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,680
was a secured facility it's like there

193
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,450
was like a security at the lobby in the

194
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,840
ground floor but then there was another

195
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:25,210
receptionist up and this up on the floor

196
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,710
that I supposed to go to and so I start

197
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,750
going there and it's like the one thing

198
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,729
worse than no security is a false sense

199
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,380
of security because people think it's

200
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,200
like they're now the okay to go through

201
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,590
levels to get in here so I'm literally

202
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,719
on this job and my job at this point I'd

203
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,820
already successfully compromised them

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,290
the day before when I do a security

205
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,430
awareness engagement I don't do red

206
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,410
teaming I do security awareness

207
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,780
engagements in other words i pone you

208
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,670
like the first day or second day it's

209
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,710
like I do though I'm the worst thing to

210
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,720
happen to you at the worst possible time

211
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,289
it's like I'm great at parties okay it's

212
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:03,130
like so so but what I do after that is

213
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:05,530
then I get caught then I make sure I do

214
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,840
something so the employees can catch me

215
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,340
because trust me there's never been a

216
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,810
domain controller that's got its

217
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,679
feelings hurt because you popped it with

218
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:17,110
Emma so egg 67 okay but you're humans do

219
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,940
get upset when you they fall for a

220
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,650
phishing email or when you show that

221
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,360
they failed it's like so you've got to

222
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,919
give them a win give your employees

223
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,380
something to look up to not just

224
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,990
everything to look down on so that's how

225
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,150
I try to do these so I was like so I

226
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,039
told my client I was like okay what I'm

227
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,478
gonna do is I'm gonna I got this USB

228
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,429
ninja looks like a lightning charger

229
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,260
cable it's like I'm not gonna attach a

230
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,419
phone to it I'm gonna plug this cable in

231
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,679
and then I'm gonna use my detonator if

232
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,909
it's not really a detonator but it

233
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,910
sounds cool when I call it a detonator

234
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:48,040
it's like and I push the button you know

235
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,810
it's like notepad pops up and it

236
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,579
automatically writes

237
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,029
test completed successfully thank you

238
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:57,399
for your cooperation smiley emoji

239
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:59,800
let's get you yes right it's like that's

240
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,939
like something's I'm good so I was like

241
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,829
I'm gonna do that

242
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:04,748
and I'll probably be successful a little

243
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:06,939
bit but then I'm gonna get caught and

244
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:09,749
then that's the win it's like my boom

245
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:14,439
it's like we're done with the engagement

246
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:17,290
six times I did that six times I'm

247
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:18,699
successful but I'm like this is not

248
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,699
working out the way I thought it would

249
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:23,349
be so I go back to where the client is

250
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:25,240
it's like my point of contact and we

251
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,720
huddle up in my okay that didn't seem to

252
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,600
work

253
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,829
I was way too successful so what I'm

254
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,829
gonna do is I'm gonna take out this

255
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:34,569
device and it's a bash bunny and it's

256
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,819
like a square it's blocky it's way more

257
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:38,889
obvious as you as we drive and I'm not

258
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:40,748
gonna be so persuasive when I talk to

259
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,730
him because I was saying that was like

260
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:43,689
an asset manager from Aldi or something

261
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,550
like that and I was auditing their

262
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:47,498
machines I'm just gonna tell my want to

263
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,559
do stuff with their machines and we'll

264
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:51,970
see how that works so I go in and I

265
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:57,389
start going through these other this

266
00:09:51,970 --> 00:10:00,100
other department six times successful

267
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,480
it's like I'm like in their defense I

268
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,269
will tell you this I was using a

269
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,100
PowerShell script this PowerShell script

270
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:09,220
is really awesome because all it does is

271
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:13,540
it runs PowerShell and it runs asking

272
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,649
asking Rick Ashley and it does the mp3

273
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,180
so you've got your speakers on you can

274
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,389
actually hear them sing I'm never going

275
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,489
to give you up which is amazing script

276
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:23,769
the problem is they had powershell

277
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,420
blocked so there's fox lit up like a

278
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,040
Christmas tree which was good on them

279
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,719
it's like they would have been able to

280
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,689
detect me if they were allowed to

281
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,179
actually result on it but I just let the

282
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:35,949
PowerShell error message be the proof

283
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:37,059
that everything is working right okay

284
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:40,689
that's what you're supposed to get very

285
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:44,279
good good job six out of six they let me

286
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:46,480
do it and so now I'm telling them okay

287
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:49,089
this is definitely not working out the

288
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,399
way I was expecting I'm just gonna go to

289
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:52,179
your IT department your programmers

290
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,399
they're gonna be a little more

291
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:56,050
suspicious it's like and I'm just gonna

292
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,269
go and say hey hey I need to plug it in

293
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,878
and see what happens it's like so I'll

294
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:03,300
go over there actually the two complete

295
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:06,300
ones both of them let me

296
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,849
I'm like I give up and so I go back to

297
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,550
the class and look I noticed that your

298
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,490
laptops don't have laptop lock cables

299
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,979
that's a finding but the size just being

300
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,750
a finding I'm just gonna start jacking

301
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,720
your laptops it's like I'm just gonna go

302
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,340
walk around I'm just gonna grab laptops

303
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,260
so literally I started walking through

304
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:29,310
their facility and stuff you know and I

305
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:34,520
would go co-op stuff like you like you

306
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:38,010
like I had by this time five laptops

307
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,240
under my arm three under one arm two on

308
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,400
the other and gone through two

309
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,430
departments it was awesome

310
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,459
it's like I've literally said out loud

311
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:49,170
to one group of people I walked by and

312
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,420
there was a MacBook and it was like a

313
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,370
thicker MacBook it was one of the

314
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,439
heavier ones and it literally there was

315
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,500
another lighter laptop next to it and I

316
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,940
said out loud oh that one looks too

317
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,760
heavy I'm just gonna take this one and I

318
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,130
just took it just based on weight which

319
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,090
I thought was sort of suspicious so I'm

320
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:12,090
now walking down this row of cubes and

321
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:16,920
there's two guys at the end of the row

322
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:18,090
and they're giving me that look and they

323
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,740
were talking to each other in each other

324
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,480
and I think I think they're talking

325
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,980
about I'm not like a great social

326
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,410
engineer but I can pick up on some vibes

327
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,060
I think they're talking about me so

328
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,689
they're just waiting for me to get over

329
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,689

330
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,970

332
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:39,930
halfway between him and me

333
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,440

334
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:46,170
station so I'm like walking and I look

335

339
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,860

340
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,730
them but I'm going hey how's it going

341
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,720

342
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,190
and the guy's like I know sir I'm with

343
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,470
the service department I knows that you

344
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,900
were you're taking some of our employees

345
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,440
Bob top yeah yeah I'm taking laptops to

346
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,649
learn

347
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,510
it's like and they're looking like okay

348
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:24,130
this is not what we expected since like

349
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,209
well these are the they're gonna be

350
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,220
coming back they're gonna need your

351
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:29,170
laptop so oh yeah of course they are

352
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,180
it's like like those I'm sure we'll get

353
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,680
them back it's like I gotta go now

354
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,300
I'll talk to you later and I walked off

355
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,689
I've literally made it to the elevator

356
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:44,079
lobby it's like I will tell you a lady

357
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:46,209
in HR she frickin 20 seconds later ran

358
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,640
me down like mother she was coming in

359
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:49,510
hot guns blazing it's like I mean if she

360
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,670
would have made it through the glass

361
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,200
door I would have dropped the laptop so

362
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,050
I was like don't hurt me please it's

363
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,380
like it's like but what was the biggest

364
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,540
problem even those two guys they did a

365
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,790
good job they try to question but they

366
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,910
weren't empowered or educated on how to

367
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:09,010
handle a situation like that it doesn't

368
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,779
matter how attentive your employees are

369
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,450
if they're not aware of what should be

370
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,100
done if your employees didn't know that

371
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,260
they should not let someone on their

372
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,260
computer unless it's been authorized and

373
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,240
they verified then that's how you're

374
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,579
gonna keep getting malware that they're

375
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,190
not empowered to call security or to

376
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:28,510
talk to someone about some weird sketchy

377
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,390
person aside you know running around

378
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:34,390
plugging USB drives in that's a problem

379
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,850
so you have to educate and empower your

380
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,100
users because that's what's important

381
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,829
it's like I should not have gotten past

382
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,360
phase one in that but it was because of

383
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:46,390
the fact that people didn't know how the

384
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,860
question and once they did question they

385
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,990
didn't know how to confront or they

386
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,279
didn't know how to respond it's like you

387
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,649
have to make sure your employees are

388
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,020
aware of that as well

389
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:57,760
now one of the things I hate it's like

390
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,130
not the CIA because you guys are

391
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,510
probably in the audience yeah but but

392
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,550
our public spaces that are well

393
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,740
monitored and highly visible I don't

394
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,229
know if this is the what the lobby of

395
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,060
the CIA looks like can anybody help me

396
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,060
is this what the lobby looks like okay

397
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,399
now we know where the feds are so so the

398
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,649
key thing is is like what I tell people

399
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,510
the only way I'm gonna see the CIA is

400
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,640
gonna be with a black bag over my head

401
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,370
going through the back door so I'm never

402
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,600
seeing this Lobby so but one of the

403
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,139
things that I do

404
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,940
hey is public spaces your lobbies you're

405
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,399
building lobbies that are well monitored

406
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,649
that are like you know hard for traffic

407
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,670
just a loiter cuz I love the loiter it's

408
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,779
like who doesn't love the loiter

409
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,219
it's like that's even a cool word

410
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:41,800
loitering it's like you know it's like

411
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,350
yeah I'm loitering it's like so that's

412
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,439
awesome except for in the places where

413
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,300
you can't do that so I was in Moscow

414
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,009
last year which is probably the reason

415
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,859
why I'm on some other list it's like I'm

416
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:55,449
going back again right after death camp

417
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,519
which is awesome it's like and I was in

418
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:59,979
Moscow and I was I have some friends

419
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,899
there and I had a friend of mine says

420
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,360
hey you're gonna be in Moscow why don't

421
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:06,459
you go hang out and do a tour the

422
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,100
kaspersky headquarters I'm like sure

423
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:10,388
it's like Eugene's a friend of mine it's

424
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,589
like I met him in German he's a really

425
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:14,740
great guy good hugger

426
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:20,110
it's like I said I'll do that so so I go

427
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:22,420
to the the headquarters and I got a if

428
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,970
you know me any but you think I can't

429
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,920

430
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,110
that I try to rob every person that I

431
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,579
need or every place that I go but I

432
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,490
always got to think about it you know

433
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:36,250
it's like how would I rob this building

434
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,480
so so I can't help is just one of those

435
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,829
things so it's like I get into the

436
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,600
headquarters and the first thing that I

437
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:42,370

441
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,269

442
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,769

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,809
it's like let's make sure you get

458
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:28,178
registered I mean this guy I don't know

459
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,590
I'm just saying it's like this guy had a

460
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,200
shirt that was either two times too

461
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,750
small or mussels four times too big it's

462
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,820
like and when you're that size you can

463
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,530
be as flat as you effin walk right it's

464
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,230
like but he was he was very

465
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,760
fashion of very polite but he firmly let

466
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,490
me know mother

467
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,430
you got a register okay it's like I

468
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,530
don't know who you are you're untrusted

469
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,500
get them over there to the registration

470
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:56,470
desk so that's what I did because I'm

471
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,270
not arguing with that guy right so I go

472
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,870
over there and I do that and that's what

473
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:05,080
you're supposed to do it's like your

474
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,560
people in your lobby should not be

475
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,659
unverified for more than five minutes

476
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,210
that may be too long it's like that your

477
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,490
Lobby is not there to be comfortable

478
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,620
it's like so many people have these

479
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,360
lobbies and I they've got a Starbucks

480
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,850
it's like they got these little cafes

481
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,510
and it's like all these productive areas

482
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,520
I love those my Wi-Fi pineapple loves

483
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,310
those it's like I mean that those are

484
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,320
great places to just hang out watch the

485
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:34,690
foot traffic see when the shifts change

486
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,050
see what kind of badges people are using

487
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:42,070
is clone badges those are amazing places

488
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:45,669
I love those lobbies it's like your

489
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,840
Lobby is to get people verified and back

490
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,690
it to where they're supposed to go

491
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,250
that's it it's like we have to get back

492
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,750
and making sure that that's one of what

493
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:57,730
your lobbies are supposed to be like oh

494
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,890
my gosh it's like you can't talk is

495
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,300
there any TSA agents in the room I'm

496
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,170
joking this is a security conference

497
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,639
there's no TSA here but but one of the

498
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,650
things is like I mean you can't talk

499
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,240
about really bad failing security or

500
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,890
security theater without mentioning the

501
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,870
TSA at some point which is another

502
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,220
reason why I have problems and get

503
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:19,600
nervous when I go back into the country

504
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,490
but but one of the things that I love is

505
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,399
no egress filtering or internal

506
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:28,720
monitoring I love that is like I

507
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:33,970
literally was in a I was bringing a

508
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:36,100
friend and I pad on this trip and TSA in

509
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,780
the u.s. they were like they were really

510
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,760
good they noticed it was in the box it

511
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,129
was still in the box I put it my main

512
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,110
carry-on and it's like it couldn't fit

513
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,050
in my little bag so it's like so I put

514
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,520
it in there and they stopped me oh my

515
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,250
gosh they stopping I'm glad they didn't

516
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,139
drop draw guns or anything

517
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,210
it's like I had that and I didn't take

518
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,520
it out and I'm like mother it's an iPad

519
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,110
it's like it's obvious it's an iPad

520
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,270
what's the deal since you have to take

521
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,919
it out okay check it out it's in the box

522
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,540
it's like we'll do I had to think it out

523
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,980
of the box no no no just you just keep

524
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,909
it there and just and you stick it out

525
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,920
yeah that helps right so I do that but

526
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,380
now I've got a connection and I got to

527
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,440
connect you Charles DeGaulle

528
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:18,030
okay sorry but they take great pride in

529
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,410
being the worst airport in the world I

530
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,440
think it's like because I mean the

531
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,970
quality shows so it's like so I go

532
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,050
through I've got like an hour connection

533
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,270
to get through there and I'm like mother

534
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,180
I am NOT this is not going to work so I

535
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:34,590
take the the gamble I realize it's like

536
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:36,930
well they're supposed to stop me it's

537
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,899
like when they knows to the iPad in

538
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,670
there but the lines are horrible the

539
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,050
crowd is already gone I mean come on

540
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,960
it's Charles DeGaulle it's like so it's

541
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:48,419
all just a cluster right there it's like

542
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,890
I'm gonna just leave it in there it's

543
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,600
like and I don't think they're gonna say

544
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,900
nothing because that guy is overworked

545
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,060
that guy knows he can use basic sense

546
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,280
when he when he's allowed to or when

547
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,330
he's too lazy to do his job it's like

548
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:08,250
I'm gonna count on that sure enough

549
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:11,429
right through he failed he did a bad job

550
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,290
it allowed me I mean I appreciated it

551
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:17,010
don't get me wrong I thought it was

552
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:18,600
awesome but he did not do his job he

553
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,760
detected something that was not in the

554
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,459
record and trust me they're stupid rules

555
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,290
anyway okay their policies suck it's

556
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,780
like it's not about security it's about

557
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:31,560
security theater so it's like but he

558
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,450
still did not do his job he still did

559
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,340
not because it was just easier to let it

560
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,650
go because there was too much crowd he

561
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,659
didn't want to worry that that's where

562
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:42,180
our problem is sometimes we have people

563
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,340
monitoring it's like but they're not

564
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,780
really using any critical thinking

565
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,169
they're not really thinking it through

566
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:53,670
there I mean remember Sony they lost one

567
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:56,010
point eight terabytes of data how do you

568
00:21:53,670 --> 00:22:01,380
let 1.8 terabytes a day to leave your

569
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:03,060
network without going you at least have

570
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,840
networking go and check to see if they

571
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,789
need to increase the

572
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,760
and with her something come on people

573
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:10,740
somebody should have said something it's

574
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,370
like Oh 1 point 8 terabytes going to

575
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:17,190
Paraguay hmm okay it's like no there's

576
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:20,250
an issue it's like saying you have to

577
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,200
have it's like so many people have all

578
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,970
these real nice fancy rules an IP

579
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,130
essence and firewalls with a you know

580
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,260
it's like layer application layer

581
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,900
firewalls that are doing all this really

582
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,350
cool stuff about keeping stuff going

583
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,039
into your network and then you ask them

584
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,870
like will

585
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,309
what are you monitoring what do you

586
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:43,889
block going outbound and you're like hmm

587
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:47,700
that's important one of the payloads

588
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:51,179
that I use is a script that called out

589
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,960
to telnet to Towell dot blinking lights

590
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:57,620
dot NL and all it does is it runs in the

591
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,289
command prompt it runs ASCII Star Wars

592
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:03,570
which is awesome except for your Bob and

593
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:07,230
accounting shouldn't have telnet to the

594
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:11,520
Netherlands why does he have telnet

595
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:13,200
access to the Netherlands so you need to

596
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,389
have that kind of monitoring you can't

597
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,770
just say I'm blocking everything cuz you

598
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,080
got to make sure you know what's going

599
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:22,379
out what's going outbound because most

600
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,049
malware they're not coming in they're

601
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,149
getting the the user to go out to their

602
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,490
command-and-control to download the rest

603
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:32,459
of the payload it's like and now it's

604
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,630
going outbound not inbound so you need

605
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,990
to understand that's what you have to

606
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:40,380
start doing more one of the things I do

607
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:42,090
hate greatly is dual factor

608
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,360
authorization enterprise-wide

609
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,559
that's a pain in the butt it's like

610
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,090
because I mean I'm not talking about

611
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,559
just on the network I love

612
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,990
computer-based dual factor

613
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,110
authentication if you go I've robbed a

614
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:58,110
lot of banks in my life and it's mostly

615
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,789
legal not ok all legal all 100 cent with

616
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,129
contracts it's like I don't any rumor

617
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:05,059
started here in Romania it's like but

618
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:09,059
whenever I go to the executives office

619
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:11,520
they are allowed to do trims transfers

620
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:13,620
and wire transfers for like millions of

621
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,960
dollars so that stuff you gotta take

622
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,669
seriously so you gotta have a dual

623
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,340
factor authentication you as

624
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,930
B Drive it's like you got to make sure

625
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,189
you keep that at all times it's like

626
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,420
this you're gonna authorize that you

627
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,880
don't want no one else you'll do it I'm

628
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,250
joking it's in the laptop usually nine

629
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,590
times out of ten nine times out of ten

630
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:34,620
they still plugged it in to the laptop

631
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,720
yeah trust me the other the other time

632
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,030
the one other time it's in their top

633
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,230
drawer it's like when I do this job I'd

634
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,730
go to a lot of people's drawers it's

635
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,980
like it's it was in the top drawer it's

636
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,980
usually worth it where the USB key fob

637
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,690
is so you gotta have the policy where

638
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,320
it's actually being used I also like

639
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:55,860
physical dual factor I mean it's great

640
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,629
having an RFID badge that's awesome it's

641
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,320
like I mean that takes like a whole you

642
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,000
know millisecond to copy now it's like

643
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,040
oh it's like and I don't I'm gonna talk

644
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,270
about the proxmark you know like I love

645
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,639
the proc smart you got but you gotta

646
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,170
touch people you think you got a you

647
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,310
gotta like do that little bump it's like

648
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,320
and that's a little awkward especially

649
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,750
more people are using lanyards so it's

650
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,460
like bumping it in the line to get food

651
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,250
is a little bit less obvious than going

652
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,590
hi how's it going this looks like you

653
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,180
got mustard on your shirt can I fix that

654
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,129
for you it's like so that's a little bit

655
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,780
more obvious now you got the boss

656
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:31,500
cornered that does it from three feet

657
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,330
away and it Auto clones it it's like so

658
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,370
I mean the attacks are going worse so

659
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,909
you have to start switching to not just

660
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:41,520
having the RFID badge but having a

661
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,020
keypad it's like you have to have that

662
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,360
dual factor it's like something that you

663
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,500
have and something that you know it's

664
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,179
like that's one of the things that we

665
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,490
need to switch up and I don't see enough

666
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,920
of them because trust me if upsets me a

667
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,270
lot when I'm trying to rob you and I

668
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,340
find out that I can't go any further

669
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,950
inside the building because I don't have

670
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,780
the pin code it's like sometimes I get

671
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,400
the pin code because it doesn't matter

672
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,980
how great your sophisticated your their

673
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:10,020
thing is if your PIN pad is worn out and

674
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:14,130
I see the keys rubbed off it is 2 & 4 &

675
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:16,170
1 & 3 I'm like hmm let me get my

676
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,120
calculus out and see what that code is

677
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,530
you know it's like it's not really hard

678
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,110
if you're like letting them wear down

679
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,420
and use the same pin code it's like

680
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:28,260
because four-digit pin code you know

681
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:30,900
that's 21 times takes 21 times to guess

682
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,309
that it's like and I'm good

683
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,480
it's like I play a lot of Angry Birds

684
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:36,180
I'm good like punching that button

685
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,650
really quick it's like I can find it so

686
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,700
you need to make sure that they

687
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:44,370
understand that now one of the things

688
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,410
that I love for coming to do is to not

689
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,809
follow established procedures it doesn't

690
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,059
matter how great and how nice your

691
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:53,160
policies and procedures are if people

692
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:55,590
aren't following the rules this was a

693
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,290
great story not okay this sorry this was

694
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:02,370
a horrible story from December of last

695
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:04,170
year where two civilians I love how they

696
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,059
say civilians to civilians somehow

697
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,100
breached an Air Force Base and we're

698
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:11,340
found only one of them told the airman

699
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,709
she'd been kidnapped everybody made this

700
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,600
big deal about you know bum-rushed in

701
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,370
area 51 like oh we're gonna do nerado

702
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,480
right like did you just drive into the

703
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,399
Civic and he doesn't seem to be a

704
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,750
problem it's I don't know why the big

705
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,340
problem is you know trying to guard for

706
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:28,260
everything you want to this guy

707
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:32,340
kidnapped a woman was on his way to do

708
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:36,179
whatever took a wrong turn drove onto

709
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,100
the Air Force Base then not realizing

710
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,250
where to go or how to get back out of

711
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,350
the Air Force Base made a stop I guess

712
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,300
he was checking Google Maps I don't know

713
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:47,070
but she was able to get out of the car

714
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,780
and run over to some servicemen gonna

715
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,460
like help me help me it's like I need

716
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:55,020
your help and their immediate response

717
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:57,990
is who are you it's like so we can all

718
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,480
agree that Air Force bases have certain

719
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,750
policies and procedures about people

720
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,440
being able to drive on but somehow that

721
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,640
guard

722
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,190
I don't think followed all the

723
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,870
procedures it's like and there reminds

724
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,150
me of another story this one's even more

725
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,889
epic okay this is actually takes place

726
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:20,280
back in the during the Cold War in the

727
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:24,720
60s a Russian spy drives on to a Air

728
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:27,560
Force Base in Germany he walks up to a

729
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:32,240
fighter jet

730
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:35,429
he takes a missile off the fighter jet

731
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,750
he puts it in a wheelbarrow and I really

732
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,490
hope that he stole the wheelbarrow while

733
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,110
he was there it's like it doesn't it

734
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,340
doesn't add to the story but it makes it

735
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,780
funnier if he stole the wheelbarrow

736
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,439
instead of having brought one with him

737
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:49,920
it's like so he puts the missile into

738
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:53,160
the wheelbarrow drives it wills it

739
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:55,470
whatever to his vehicle puts the missile

740
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,050
in the back seat was a Mercedes because

741
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:01,680
Germany it's like a puts the missile in

742
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:04,409
the back seat puts a red flag cuz it's

743
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,700
sticking out the the window and German

744
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,790
walls of German walls you don't have

745
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,680
with those okay it's like puts it and

746
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:16,649
drives it back to his home he then

747
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:19,350
disassembles the missile and evens you

748
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:22,590
gotta say email it's like mails East

749
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:24,629
peace back to Russia and the best part

750
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,220
about that it was that German mail

751
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:30,900
system is very efficient every single

752
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:33,570
piece made it it's like so we can all

753
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:36,090
agree maybe some policies and procedures

754
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,070
weren't followed there either so it's

755
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,419
not like a one-off thing we have to make

756
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,669
sure you're following a proper

757
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,740
procedures it's like you want to say

758
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:45,210
that your server room is secured and I'm

759
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,640
like isn't secured as good as an

760
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,830
airforce based in Germany oh yeah then

761
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,510
you're in trouble dude it's like you're

762
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,629
in some serious trouble you got to make

763
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:58,379
it better than that okay so you have to

764
00:29:54,630 --> 00:30:00,510
worry about that stuff so now what is

765
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,240
the main point that I'm trying to do

766
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:05,910
it's like I call this my desert desert

767
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,100
not desert desert and vegetables talk

768
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,900
because I wanted to start off by giving

769
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,159
you some funny stories maybe getting a

770
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,420
couple laughed it's like trying to

771
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,590
entertain you on some of the things that

772
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,780
we have to watch out for

773
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,070
it's like pros and cons things that we

774
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,110
have to watch out for we're doing our

775
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:21,060
job but now let's get to the

776
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,740
nitty-gritty let's ask some questions

777
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,419
it's like let's ask some questions that

778
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,650
we can talk because I want you to be

779
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,450
able to bring stuff back to your

780
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,010
enterprise and your company saying hey

781
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,290
here are some questions I think we

782
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,430
should look at so let's go into that

783
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,629
it's like I'm one of those guys it's

784
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,910
like I don't like to just go onto the

785
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:38,760
onto the stage and say hey this is how

786
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:40,490
it's all broken okay I'm done and you're

787
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,259
like well how do you fix that

788
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,669
our brief stuff it's like do you not see

789
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:45,950
my resume it's like that's just what I

790
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:48,200
do it's like I don't fix the stuff you

791
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,730
wasted my time it's like if I'm not

792
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,230
coming up with the solution if I'm not

793
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,029
trying to help you with stuff to make it

794
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,830
better then I just came up and just

795
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:56,029
Graham standard for an hour so it's like

796
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,590
let's go and make sure that we're

797
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:59,299
actually adding some of the other stuff

798
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,519
from the security side from the

799
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:03,590
defensive side so here's one of the

800
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,210
first questions that you want to take

801
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,509
back who do you ask for identification

802
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:12,259
and this was a trick question

803
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:13,850
everybody right you asked everybody no I

804
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:15,619
did throw in a trick one because that

805
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:19,998
guy actually has a company ID but you

806
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:23,019
still you asked everyone it's like my

807
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:26,419
friend Ben Tenn from trusted sack he

808
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:30,080
told me this great story of one of his

809
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:32,690
clients that what they do is they played

810
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,439
the Where's Waldo games and like that's

811
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,450
amazing

812
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,899
tell me more it's like and what they do

813
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:42,220
is every quarter one of the employees in

814
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:45,439
the company has their badge replaced

815
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,629
they're given a new badge same access

816
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,679
same everything else but the picture has

817
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:54,918
been changed to Waldo and you get money

818
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,769
if you spot that person during that

819
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:01,190
quarter so do you know what people are

820
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:04,490
doing employees are doing the badges

821
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,440
you're like that's my badge are you

822
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,749
supposed to be here it's like looking

823
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,539
for Waldo you know they don't care about

824
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:14,330
your security but now there's something

825
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:16,549
in it for them - what you do in

826
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,990
gamification it's like you can't make

827
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:20,779
people more secure but you can

828
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:23,179
incentivize them being more secure it's

829
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:24,470
like and that's what they did so it's

830
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:27,080
like people started looking for badges

831
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,119
I've literally worked out a bank for 14

832
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,779
years my badge

833
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,730
I had one badge in the middle it's like

834
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:37,460
that I had two badges on either side

835
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:40,070
from Sky Dog it's like one said Stark

836
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,649
Industries and it had my picture on it

837
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:45,740
it's like and the other one was from

838
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:48,350
income so if you like Iron Man or Tron

839
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:52,369
there's like you get those it's like no

840
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:54,490
one questioned me about that badge the

841
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:56,139
baby sad you know it's

842
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:58,929
I mean cuz come on let's face it I look

843
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,250
sketchy a YES on the regular right it's

844
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:02,710
like for them not the question they just

845
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,240
fix it even works it's like so you have

846
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,130
to make sure you're questioning people

847
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,540
for their identification make sure that

848
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,460
person is supposed to be there knows

849
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:13,540
they're I mean on that job that I did

850
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:16,600
last week they'll be you also tell your

851
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:19,928
employees you don't Instagram your

852
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,879
employee badges Thank You Microsoft

853
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:23,410
though you keep going cuz it's like I've

854
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,760
got so many different Microsoft badges

855
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,800
that I use some with my name someone

856
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,030
else's name it's like and someone's

857
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,100
always nice enough to give me the

858
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:33,160
updated one so that's awesome

859
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:35,350
usually on Twitter so that's perfect

860
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:39,280
it's like what that's really bad

861
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:42,340
I had an employee badge last week

862
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:45,550
because someone instagrammed it and the

863
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:50,169
logo they used on the badge was the same

864
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:52,210
logo as their website logo so it

865
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:54,940
literally took less than 20 minutes for

866
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,650
my friend April to actually create me a

867
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,420
new employee badge that mimic the one

868
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:01,240
from Instagram it's a pretty good copy

869
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,770
because it got me everywhere so you have

870
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,330
to make sure your employees know to be

871
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,950
careful about those badges that can

872
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,820
actually mean something to someone it's

873
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,460
like some of that's trying to do

874
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,409
something bad

875
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,540
now we're talking about the social media

876
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:15,070
that segues into it it's like what does

877
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,379
your social media profile really say

878
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:19,720
about you people go and talk about like

879
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:24,250
well you can't do this like we're not

880
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:25,899
talking about the company saying this is

881
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,210
what you can post this is what you can't

882
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:30,368
post okay because then you start getting

883
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:33,220
in a lot of different gray areas what

884
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:36,490
I'm saying is employers need to start

885
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:39,668
explaining to employees not dictating to

886
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:42,310
them what they should do but actually

887
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:44,469
educating them on by the way did you

888
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:46,299
know if you post this information I can

889
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:47,949
calculate all that and all that

890
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,710
information and I can then try to assume

891
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:52,449
your identity to send a fish email to

892
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,369
your coworker so they'll believe that

893
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:56,379
it's you because I can gather that

894
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:58,359
information show them how it could be

895
00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:00,220
dangerous I literally had what I was

896
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:02,609
doing one talk in a second I decide to

897
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:06,759
rob a bank do a demo for robbing a bank

898
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:09,340
and I found a employee

899
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:14,050
managers from the bank's Facebook

900
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:15,910
profile I was not offended this person

901
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,250
and trust me after this talk I was never

902
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:21,060
going to be a friend to this person but

903
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:25,510
she had listed her actual phone number

904
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:28,450
and street address on her public

905
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:31,300
Facebook profile I did not have to be a

906
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:34,060
friend to see those so I put that in the

907
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,180
slide the very next slide was the

908
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:39,130
picture of her house come on remember

909
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,629
the kittens I'm not that creepy Google

910
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,800
Streetview okay I didn't go there and

911
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,810
take a picture of her house to prove a

912
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,610
point it's like I'm too lazy for that

913
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,830
it's like I just I just went and got it

914
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,030
off a Google Streetview

915
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,650
imagine what people reacted when they

916
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:53,380
realize it's like that's what could

917
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:57,280
happen show them how that impact works

918
00:35:53,380 --> 00:36:00,760
show them how what you can do online can

919
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,250
be detrimental to your job at work it's

920
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,100
like I mean I've had other issues too as

921
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:09,700
well with other situations where I've

922
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:14,740
posted some questionable content it's

923
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:16,509
like before am i my CIO one time one the

924
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:19,629
only time that I got caught on it it's

925
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:21,340
like someone try to catch me on it was

926
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:24,910
the CIO of the bank I used to work for

927
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:27,190
it's like Jason blood you had a good

928
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,890
time at Def Con it's like I follow you

929
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:32,260
on twitter can you explain to me this

930
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:35,020
what appears to be a naked hug that

931
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,820
you're doing with pause' Dorian behind

932
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:39,970
the HEC naked banner at Def Con and I'm

933
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:42,190
like we i had underwear on okay and he

934
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,779
had shorts on it's like but we had this

935
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,450
banner that made it look like it was an

936
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,250
awkward hug gone horribly wrong and I

937
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,890
still blame Paul and Dave Kennedy for

938
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,780
that and I just explained jobs like dude

939
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:57,129
let me let me break it down to you it's

940
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:59,380
like what I tweet is my stuff it's like

941
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:04,420
not your stuff I've never referenced you

942
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:06,520
publicly so I don't care and also I have

943
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:10,350
more followers in this Bank does so I

944
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,350
don't care about that either so

945
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:16,720
and he's like valid points exactly he

946
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,240
hated me anyway don't worry it's like it

947
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,009
was way before this so so that was just

948
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,629
one of those issues so you have to make

949
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,660
sure that you're not trying to dictate

950
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,040
what your people are posting you're not

951
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,750
trying to police their post you're

952
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,650
trying to let them understand why it

953
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:33,370
could be dangerous to them insider

954
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,440
threats

955
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:37,690
what's one of the biggest insider

956
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,180
threats when we think insider threats we

957
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:40,990
think the malicious insider right the

958
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:46,710
bad guy

959
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:50,410
the evil dude I'm doing bad stuff but no

960
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:53,080
you're limiting your scope you don't

961
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:56,410
understand it's like the insider threat

962
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:59,110
may not be malicious it could just be

963
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:01,509
stupid and once again I said something

964
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,970
about bad security and stupidity you

965
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,730
know I'm bringing up the TSA again so

966
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,560
here it is about 14 million check bags

967
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,790
pass through TSA hands during the things

968
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,660
giving you the holiday weekend that's an

969
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,170
awesome story

970
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,940
why did you print the keys out why did

971
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,860
you show everybody exactly what the keys

972
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,620
look like so people can make blanks and

973
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:24,090
trust me you can 3d print all these keys

974
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:26,859
now they're available online to print

975
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,570
when the government was reached for

976
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,190
comment Homeland Security was asked

977
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,110
thanks dude why'd you do this you this

978
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,750
is a secure bridge Homeland Security

979
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:36,580
remember the same government who wants

980
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,190
all your encryption keys on your mobile

981
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:43,060
devices it's like doing stuff with these

982
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:45,580
keys they're like it's not really a

983
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,470
security thing it's for convenience and

984
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,670
the travelers it's like so we don't

985
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,709
really consider this an issue where

986
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,140
we're gonna have to resolve it and I'm

987
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,910
like yeah I really want you back during

988
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,500
my Apple thank you it's like you know

989
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,750
that's a problem we have to ask

990
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,580
ourselves that it's like that's one of

991
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:04,360
the things you have to worry about they

992
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:08,140
could care less they screwed up but it's

993
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,210
like yeah you know it's like that's an

994
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,230
insider threat

995
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:13,270
sometimes the threats coming from inside

996
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:16,330
the house it's like I had an executive

997
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:19,720
one time at a company who decided to be

998
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:23,049
a good worker he decided to go above and

999
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,598
beyond his job because he noticed that

1000
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,519
he was bending

1001
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,460
a lot of time in the conference room and

1002
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:31,008
he was not able to get emails he wasn't

1003
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,690
able to respond to situations fast

1004
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:34,999
enough because he had like an hour or

1005
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:37,130
two hours of conference room so he did

1006
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:39,379
the best thing that he could do it's

1007
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,549
like he got a Linksys router and trust

1008
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,170
me cuz when I got to the parking lot it

1009
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:44,779
literally just said links is still it's

1010
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:47,210
like kind of Linksys router plugged in

1011
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:50,390
the internal network into the internet

1012
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:52,970
jack of the the Linksys and now he had

1013
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,499
Wi-Fi in the conference room so he could

1014
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:57,618
still do work and still answer his

1015
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:59,359
emails and be very productive guess who

1016
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:02,269
else was very productive that day

1017
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,999
looks like that'd be me it's like that's

1018
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:07,640
an issue he was not a malicious insider

1019
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:08,538
it doesn't matter when you're reporting

1020
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,910
the breach

1021
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:14,029
he had that going for six months before

1022
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:16,519
I got there I'm glad I wasn't I was the

1023
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:18,109
only one there so I think the whole role

1024
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:19,488
of a nodes you know just being rolled up

1025
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:22,249
right to it and said you know it's like

1026
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:24,109
the saturation is just horrible so

1027
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:26,359
you've got to make sure that look for

1028
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:28,430
the insiders that are not being

1029
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:31,239
malicious but they could just be making

1030
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:33,399
mistakes they're not educated properly

1031
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:35,390
and phishing is one of the leading

1032
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,440
causes of compromise but do your

1033
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,920
employees really take it seriously

1034
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,089
absolutely download I put this in today

1035
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,229
it's like phishing attacks to reach

1036
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:47,328
highest levels in three years it's like

1037
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:49,819
we keep talking about all these dangers

1038
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:51,019
online all these different

1039
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:53,210
vulnerabilities all these different

1040
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:57,308
holes and os is in software mobile

1041
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:57,309
people are still clicking lengths people

1042
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:02,328
it's like hey it's like hey Allison give

1043
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:03,558

I'll send you something you'll love it

1045
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:07,789
it's like so I mean I'm telling you

1046
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:11,058
educating your employees about the

1047
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:14,900
dangers remember target lost over 300

1048
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:18,440
million dollars and it wasn't their

1049
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,769
company that got breached first it was

1050
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:25,900
an HVAC company their air con company

1051
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:30,169
one employee clicked one link

1052
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:33,319
target just had a relationship with them

1053
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:35,359
a service agreement lost 300 million

1054
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:38,450
dollars because of that one link and

1055
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,279
that one email you know you know when

1056
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,149
you ever hear these you know feds or

1057
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,730
security people they're talking like

1058
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:46,460
what was apt well you gotta be careful

1059
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:49,359
about anything I hate that let's be

1060
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:51,770
honest who advanced persistent threats

1061
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,750
really that's what you tell your

1062
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:55,009
stockholders and shareholders and stuff

1063
00:41:53,750 --> 00:42:00,700
you know there's time people when you

1064
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:06,530
got popped right apt stands for adequate

1065
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:08,689
fishing technique that's it ninety-nine

1066
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:11,990
percent of the time that's your apt

1067
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,520
right there it's like so we need to stop

1068
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,649
trying to make it look like we got no

1069
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,390
you got popped by a link it's like

1070
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,220
someone said click here for your UPS

1071
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,339
package that that's not sophisticated

1072
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,839
okay that's not advanced it's like it is

1073
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,680
slightly threatening you know cuz it's

1074
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,200
like you know you want to get that

1075
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,299
package but still it doesn't matter so

1076
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,629
you need to train your employees not to

1077
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:35,509
just to be aware of suspicious of emails

1078
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,670
emails are dangerous things you know

1079
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,230
it's dangerous to go alone take this you

1080
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:42,220
know your antivirus all your other stuff

1081
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:46,130
but educate them as well on how to do it

1082
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,839
and do you vet your security system to

1083
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,700
make sure they're operating is attended

1084
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,770
I think this is a perfect example

1085
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,899
because I love this like the NSA

1086
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,520
improperly over collected call detail

1087
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,109
records for a second time last year

1088
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,309
documents show renewing private to

1089
00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:00,799
concerns about the surveillance program

1090
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:02,510
due to expire in December and have you

1091
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:04,280
ever noticed and this is from this year

1092
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,099
that's from June have you ever noticed

1093
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,109
the NSA just like Facebook coincidence I

1094
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:12,230
have always when they made a mistake

1095
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:13,609
it's always to suck down more data have

1096
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,130
you ever gotten to notice from Facebook

1097
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:18,200
saying oh we accidentally locked your

1098
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,119
account down more so it was more private

1099
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,529
so if you need to share stuff more

1100
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:22,609
publicly it's like you need to change

1101
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,460
your settings nope

1102
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:27,710
it's always hey we left it wide open our

1103
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,119
bad Facebook just had another one where

1104
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,280
they said that it's like where they just

1105
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,540
had their groups privacy day that was

1106
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,250
like whoops somehow that was being

1107
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:38,080
collected by everybody hate it when that

1108
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:41,970
happens it's like so why do we let

1109
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:44,020
Sales Engineers come in buy us dinner

1110
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:46,089
it's like tell us about all the

1111
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,950
wonderful gizmos and big bobs and things

1112
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:52,660
that this our device can do plug it in

1113
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,490
set the defaults and though our job is

1114
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:57,370
done and then you're like okay we're

1115
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:59,109
protected snorts installed with the

1116
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:04,359
default rule base we should be fine

1117
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:07,840
right no there's a problem with that you

1118
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:10,720
need to bet every quarter you should be

1119
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,580
sending malware to one of your systems

1120
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,950
I'm going on Twitter saying Jason sands

1121
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,870
in the malware to know have a system

1122
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:19,270
that is dedicated that mirrors your work

1123
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:21,339
environment that the network mirrors

1124
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:24,580
your work environment but is segmented

1125
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:27,010
from your company it's like and send it

1126
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,170
malware see if your email controls

1127
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:31,540
actually work see if it doesn't call

1128
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:34,270
back at the firewall report see what

1129
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:36,640
goes on on the network what alerts see

1130
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:41,770
it because sometimes you're gonna be

1131
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:44,109
surprised nothing did that's an issue so

1132
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:46,030
you need to bet it you can't just say oh

1133
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:49,570
he bought me dinner everything should

1134
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:50,830
work out fine no you need to test that

1135
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:53,080
trust but verify

1136
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:54,759
it's like make sure that that equipment

1137
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,040
is actually doing what you paid that

1138
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,630
billions of dollars for it's like I mean

1139
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,550
we all know that the lights blue now so

1140
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:03,940
it's like it's definitely working but

1141
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:07,300
what else is it doing so you've got to

1142
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:09,940
test those things and also this is an

1143
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,320
important thing okay I'm sorry I'm not

1144

trying to just keep pig valium come on

1145
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,770

1146
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,720
instant response created another

1147
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:18,160
incident this was a response from

1148
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,299
Homeland Security I'm still not getting

so they're saying it's like they get

1158
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:42,100

hacked CBP contractor that was leaked on

1179
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,140
the dark web you can see the person's

1180
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,790
face and vehicle license plate clearly

1181
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,859
we're bored there are thousands of these

1182
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:42,910
images free for anyone to download on

1183
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:46,450
the dark web website he's literally

1184
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:49,870
found it in under three hours that's a

1185
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:52,689
problem so now not only do you have an

1186
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:55,150
incident breach from Homeland Security

1187
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:57,130
it's like there but now how can you

1188
00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:00,280
trust him like you did before but still

1189
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:02,860
how can you trust them now it's like

1190
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:06,370
with this issue it's like because they

1191
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:10,120
lie they did not adequately inform you

1192
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:13,569
if your company gets popped let it own

1193
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:15,549
up to it do full disclosure let your

1194
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:18,580
people you're responsible for let them

1195
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,080
know hey we got breached that's no one's

1196
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:22,990
going to be surprised at that

1197
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:26,620
this is 2019 people it's just a matter

1198
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:30,129
of time but how you respond to it

1199
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,839
matters how you communicate to your

1200
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,760
shareholders you communicate to your

1201
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:37,360
customers how you communicate to your

1202
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,240
peers that's what matters now it's like

1203
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,950
how quickly do you respond to it how

1204
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,200
quickly did you notice it what

1205
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,509
ramifications were there what is it is

1206
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:49,899
took place what was what was done what

1207
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:53,140
was the response how fast how effective

1208
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,510
share that information cuz I still

1209
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,310
understand that you got popped but now I

1210
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,710
feel better about it because you've

1211
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,360
responded properly you've let me know so

1212
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:04,089
now I feel like you're more confident to

1213
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:06,069
handle something it's like not like this

1214
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:09,999
so it's like you want to be able to try

1215
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:12,249
to do that and anything on a somewhat

1216
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:15,549
positive note this happened a couple

1217
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:18,488
days ago Trend Micro got popped

1218
00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:19,769
once again surprise face it's like by an

1219
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:23,589
insider threat

1220
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:26,288
so then insider employee malicious that

1221
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:28,900
mother malicious okay because he

1222
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:30,910
downloaded the database the customer

1223
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,309
database with information and then try

1224
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,049
to insult it to some scam call center

1225
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:36,819
people which you know has a certain

1226
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:39,189
level of hell waiting for them but still

1227
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:42,880
went after them and that was resented

1228
00:48:39,189 --> 00:48:45,459
Trend Micro found it and responded to it

1229
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,009
but not only did they do that they did

1230
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:51,759
it a full disclosure explaining to them

1231
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:54,489
on their website what occurred what took

1232
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:57,099
place that they informed their their

1233
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:58,509
people that were affected it's like and

1234
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:00,400
they handled the situation and they

1235
00:48:58,509 --> 00:49:03,160
contacted law enforcement they told us

1236
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,069
what we needed to know and they owned up

1237
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,390
to the fact of it it's like so that's

1238
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:10,089
what you need to do it's like you're

1239
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:12,699
good if you get breached it happens but

1240
00:49:10,089 --> 00:49:17,038
how you respond matters so make sure

1241
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:21,339
you're doing that now this is a

1242
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:23,799
confession time that I usually do on

1243
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:26,349
this talk this year is how many people

1244
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:30,160
have noticed that my talk usually has

1245
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:32,949
the same theme for 10 years people I've

1246
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,868
been saying the same thing over and over

1247
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:38,349
over again just finding different ways

1248
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:39,789
and kittens to get the point across I'm

1249
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:40,989
tired of being so subtle because

1250
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:43,529
everybody looks at me like Jason you're

1251
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:46,599
so subtle I know it's a problem it's

1252
00:49:43,529 --> 00:49:49,660
like we have a problem here people it's

1253
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:52,779
not the technology we're not investing

1254
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:54,779
time and our users we're not explaining

1255
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:58,329
them and holding them to accountability

1256
00:49:54,779 --> 00:49:59,920
to protect our enterprise it's like if

1257
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:02,319
you look at your employees as a

1258
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,019
liability guess what that's exactly what

1259
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:07,599
they'll be if you start looking at your

1260
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:10,149
employees like assets like part of your

1261
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,519
security department guess what that's

1262
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:16,299
what they'll be the choice is up to you

1263
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:17,859
stop blaming them that's on you how you

1264
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:21,100
treat your employees how you

1265
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:23,410
employees that's on you so if you want

1266
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,120
assets instead of liabilities take the

1267
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:27,129
time to start actually properly

1268
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,970
educating your users on how to be more

1269
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,970
security aware

1270
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:45,200
[Applause]

1271
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:47,390
thank you so much Jason that's I think

1272
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,270
we're gonna need a minute to take that

1273
00:50:47,390 --> 00:51:02,569
and so we have time for two very quick

1274
00:50:50,270 --> 00:51:04,100
questions yes if you have a low security

1275
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:07,640
budget for your company it's like how do

1276
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:09,110
you secure it you do that by how much

1277
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,720
did the poster board cost

1278
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:13,340
it's like putting security awareness

1279
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,890
posters printing them out putting them

1280
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:18,710
in the break rooms it's like getting a

1281
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:20,990
gift card it's like and then saying

1282
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:23,330
there's a raffle every quarter for

1283
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:26,689
people who respond to a phishing email

1284
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:28,670
or they respond to a visitor they get

1285
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:31,220
entered into a drawing the prize doesn't

1286
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:34,010
change quarter-to-quarter but the people

1287
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:35,899
that participate do so find low-budget

1288
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,360
ways to do that to make it a competition

1289
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,640
make it sort of gamification for your

1290
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,680
users that doesn't take technology and

1291
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,390
also do lunch and learns where they can

1292
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,330
bring their own lunch in it's like and

1293
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:49,759
you can teach them how to do security at

1294
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:52,130
their Wi-Fi at their house how to check

1295
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,590
their their social media profiles for

1296
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,150
security leaks none of that has to do

1297
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,380
with company security but then again

1298
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,030
they don't care about your company's

1299
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,160
security you choose to them how to be

1300
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:03,440
security conscious at home they bring

1301
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,359
that to work it's like so educate them

1302
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,340
that way it's like in that doesn't cost

1303
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,920
hardly any money it's like so that

1304
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:12,170
that's better for the low budget yes so

1305
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,570
one more question all right your hand

1306
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:18,560
please stand up so we can see you take

1307
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:21,620
that yeah thank you my question is kind

1308
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:23,960
of weird did you marry weird

1309
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:25,310
did you manage to steal a surveillance

1310
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:30,770
camera ever

1311
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:34,100

1312
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:37,100
stolen surveillance cameras but I have

1313
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:39,740
stolen DVRs before it's like it's way

1314
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,660
easier it's like because the cameras are

1315
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,399
a little more obvious it's like but if

1316
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,990
you take the DVRs they all record to

1317
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,410
you're just as good it's like you know

1318
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:49,819
