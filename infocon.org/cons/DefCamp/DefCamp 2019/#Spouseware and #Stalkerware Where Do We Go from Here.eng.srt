1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:07,500
hi there this seems a little loud my

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,010
name is Eva galperin and I'm here to

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,690
radicalize you so I work for the

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,040
Electronic Frontier Foundation we're a

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,859
digital civil liberties organization

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,869
based out of San Francisco how many of

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,170
you here are already familiar with EF F

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,269
a few people one or two then you know

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,330
that we're a sticker tan sticker and

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,669
t-shirt company with a law firm attached

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,380
and some engineers but mostly t-shirts

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,110
and stickers were very successful when

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,079
it comes to t-shirts and stickers so I

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,239
am here to talk to you about a project

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:44,640
that I launched against my will and

16
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,899
against my better judgment I'm going to

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,350
talk a little bit about what I found

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,809
when when I made this this project

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,000
happen what conclusions I came to and

20
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:58,078
most importantly I'm going to talk about

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,760
how you can both do something about this

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,859
particular problem that I decided to

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,530
look at but also about how you can apply

24
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,580
this framework to deal with other large

25
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,920
scary intractable problems in InfoSec

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,929
and in your community so we're going to

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,840
talk a little bit about spouse wearing

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,820
stalker wear I in order to talk about

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,150
spouse word stalker we're first we must

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,658
go back in time we're going to go all

31
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,400
the way back in time to 2017 you may not

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,290
remember that far back there were

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,670
dinosaurs roaming the earth it was very

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:36,450
strange and between about 2012 and 2017

35
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:42,740
I did most of my security research on a

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:46,020
PT's I cared about state actors Vietnam

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,908
Lebanon Kazakhstan so like you know not

38
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,850
you're particularly high-end

39
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,540
nation-states but if there was a sort of

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,100
lazy state actor that was sloppily

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,020
targeting journalists or activists I was

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,880
interested in exposing them because it

43
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,289
wasn't that hard

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,170
and also because journalists and

45
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,920
activists were very easy targets at the

46
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,700
end of 2017 I discovered something

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,410
terrible which was that one of the

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,730
security researchers with whom I

49
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,490
been doing my work for all of these

50
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:23,760
years was outed as a serial rapist

51
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:26,690
so I read an article which was an

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,790
interview with one of his victims and

53
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,460
she was at the at the time I think she

54
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,010
was a she was a teenager and the

55
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,690
journalist asked her well what why did

56
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,970
you take so long to come forward why

57
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,800
didn't you tell anybody what happened to

58
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:46,680
you and she said well I was a you know

59
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,400
teenage punk kid and he was this big

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,680
important hacker and I was scared that

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,420
he was going to hack my computer and he

62
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,890
was going to hack my phone and this was

63
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,589
something they had threatened to do and

64
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:05,100
I just didn't feel safe and I got mad I

65
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,950
got really really mad because I felt

66
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,140
complicit in this I had I had brought I

67
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,929
had sort of built up my career with this

68
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,809
guy and now here he was making this

69
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,780
woman feel like she was this big and

70
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,760
like her devices were not safe and I

71
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,370
didn't ever want anybody to feel that

72
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,709
way again so I did what most people do

73
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,640
when they're very very angry I tweeted I

74
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,290
don't know how many of you here are

75
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,010
familiar with my Twitter account it has

76
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:38,250
some followers so at the at the time I

77
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,540
had just read this this interview and so

78
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,310
I tweeted if you are a woman who has

79
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,480
been sexually abused by a hacker who

80
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,550
then threatened to compromise your

81
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,350
devices contact me and I will make sure

82
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,970
that they are properly examined now I

83
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:54,180
thought that maybe one or two people

84
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,830
would call me maybe a journalist might

85
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,330
might call me maybe

86
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,709
like I would have a little bit of work

87
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:04,230
to do so nine thousand four hundred and

88
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:08,430
sixty three retweets and sixteen

89
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:11,510
thousand three hundred 99 likes later my

90
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,510
inbox was full

91
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:21,989
I spent a lot of time at one point I was

92
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:24,620
looking at somewhere between Oh 12 and

93
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:27,690
15 contacts a day reaching out to me

94
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,449
telling you the story of the worst thing

95
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,070
that had ever happened to them over and

96
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:35,070
over and over again which let me tell

97
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:39,120
you was not great for my mental health I

98
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:41,130
was not planning to start a project my

99
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,220
plan was just to maybe help one or two

100
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,990
people but instead hundreds of people

101
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:51,080
reached out to me and they were really

102
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:55,790
sort of piling up day after day and I

103
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:58,229
was able to help many of them but I

104
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:01,500
learned some very interesting things

105
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:03,840
along the way the most the most

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,190
interesting thing that I learned was

107
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,039
that most people don't actually

108
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,350
understand what kind of help they need

109
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,729
when you offer them help with forensic

110
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,320
analysis if you tell people I will you

111
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:21,120
know look to see whether or not your

112
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,130
device has been compromised

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,160
they will tell you yes of course my

114
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,130
device has been compromised more often

115
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,300
than not what I saw was a lot of account

116
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,840
compromised

117
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:39,020
I saw email accounts being compromised I

118
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,020
saw Google accounts Apple like iCloud

119
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:46,889
Facebook snapchat Instagram if it had a

120
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,840
login it was compromised and I saw this

121
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,090
over and over and over again it was

122
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,979
incredibly common for people to come to

123
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,320
me unable to tell the difference between

124
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:58,889
somebody compromising one or more of

125
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:02,280
their accounts or having completely

126
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:04,500
compromised their their device and in

127
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,119
fact it was much more common for people

128
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,800
to believe that their devices had been

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,539
compromised than people to believe that

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,740
their accounts had been compromised

131
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:17,610
because in the sort of popular

132
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:20,260
imagination hacking is getting rude on a

133
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,180
device and

134
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,099
so they assume that that's the easiest

135
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,200
thing to do that that's the simplest and

136
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,580
most default way of doing things and

137
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,010
then I had to spend a lot of time

138
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,820
explaining to them no it's probably your

139
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:37,210
account and in some ways that's good

140
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,490
news because we have advice for people

141
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,979
who are worried about account compromise

142
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,810
we have a game plan for account

143
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,820
compromise if somebody comes to you with

144
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,850
an account compromise you tell them well

145
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,260
first off change all your passwords make

146
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,820
sure that they are unique make sure

147
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,530
they're strong make sure you're using a

148
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,170
password manager make sure you're using

149
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,820
the highest level of two-factor

150
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:02,470
authentication that you're comfortable

151
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:05,980
with now that last bit is is a little

152
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,570
bit controversial but generally yes I

153
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,850
would like everybody out there to be

154
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,450
using to be using Ubik use for

155
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:15,940
everything all the time but often I am

156
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,520
contacted by people who cannot spend $50

157
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:22,540
on a Yubikey who will not use they you

158
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,969
lucky if you give it to them or who find

159
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,730
that entire process very stressful and

160
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:31,270
if all I can get them to do is use

161
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:33,250
Google Authenticator or of--they or even

162
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:38,549
a text message that's better than

163
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:41,770
nothing so we have advice for the four

164
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,250
account compromise and usually what I

165
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,659
tell people is after you have secured

166
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,410
your accounts after you have done all of

167
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:54,100
these things if you are still seeing

168
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:58,810
problems then then we go looking for

169
00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:00,160
device compromise and we also have you

170
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,350
know things that we can point people to

171
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,350
so there the security page that you have

172
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,750
on your on your Facebook account which

173
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,580
shows you the various things that have

174
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:14,680
been logging into Facebook pretending to

175
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:17,440
be you there's a similar page for for

176
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,970
Apple products and I will slowly but

177
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,410
surely walk people through all of this

178
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,450
stuff but sometimes it really is a wrap

179
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,250
every once in a while somebody changes

180
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,820
all of their passwords use as a password

181
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,039
manager has to FA set up and they are

182
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,010
still having their accounts compromised

183
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,809
again

184
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:40,100
and again and again they called me up

185
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:44,630
extremely worried in the cases that came

186
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:48,830
to me I it was a rat probably like one

187
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:51,010
time out of 50 the vast majority of the

188
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:55,910
cases that I was looking at which were

189
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:59,060
usually men spying on women but also

190
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:03,650
occasionally women spying on women women

191
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,599
spying on men been spying on men every

192
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:10,310
combination of people that you can that

193
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,350
you can imagine the whole handshake but

194
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,839
sometimes it really was a rat and in the

195
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,000
cases where it was a rat those were the

196
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,270
most intrusive and frightening cases

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,510
those were the cases where people came

198
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:26,180
to me and felt the most out of control

199
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:29,750
they felt that they didn't know what

200
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:33,229
they could trust sometimes these cases

201
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,060
involved involved stalking they involved

202
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,730
physical harassment they involved

203
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,430
physical abuse they involved kidnapping

204
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:43,430
sometimes kidnapping of the of the

205
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:47,120
victims children I and so these were the

206
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:50,030
most intense cases and the problem with

207
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,940
with these cases which involve a rat on

208
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,130
somebody's on somebody's device turned

209
00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:00,290
out to be that we don't have good advice

210
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:02,420
for them at all and so I ended up

211
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,120
working on it alone I just had this you

212
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,900
know enormous queue and I became the you

213
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,170
know it's sort of frontline IT for all

214
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:15,380
of the world's abused women we like to

215
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:18,319
think of this in human rights as the

216
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,380
hero model and that means that one

217
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,540
person heroically shows up does all the

218
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,790
work everybody comes to them they become

219
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,030
the single point of failure but they

220
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,860
also get you know glowing profiles and

221
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,870
wired and

222
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,420
really nice articles written about them

223
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,370
in magazines in which they have dramatic

224
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,240
photos taken of them and they get to

225
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:44,300
look very heroic I'm here to tell you

226
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,130
that this is it's actually

227
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,750
extremely bad for your mental health

228
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,000
this is not the way that we should be

229
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:55,880
doing things kill your heroes kill them

230
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,730
right now in the words of Tina Turner my

231
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,600
personal favorite warrior poet we don't

232
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,779
need another hero

233
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,790
something something Thunderdome but

234
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:08,570
instead what we need to do is we need to

235
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:11,390
think about ways in which to maximize

236
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,490
our efforts so that when you are looking

237
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,980
at a problem you're not just helping one

238
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,080
person but you're looking at a way that

239
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,440
you can change the system in order to

240
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:25,520
help many people and I'm very lucky in

241
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,959
that I have a model for this EF F in

242
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,000
addition to having all of these

243
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,469
engineers and all of these activists is

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,680
a is a law firm and what we do is called

245
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,680
impact litigation impact litigation is

246
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,089
made up of a sort of a series of

247
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,209
lawsuits and the idea is that when you

248
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:50,930
file these lawsuits these lawsuits are

249
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:55,040
designed to create good precedent in the

250
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:58,899
law or to sort of strike down bad

251
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:02,300
precedent in the law in sort of novel

252
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:04,880
novel ways and when people come to EF F

253
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,399
with cases one of the very first things

254
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,529
that we ask ourselves is is this going

255
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,810
to help people beyond the people who are

256
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:14,480
directly involved in the case is this

257
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:17,209
going to have far-reaching applications

258
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,140
because helping one person at a time is

259
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:22,630
not what impact litigators do so I tried

260
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:27,079
to think of a way to be sort of an

261
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:30,070
impact engineer and try to figure out

262
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:35,779
where I could sort of push things so

263
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:39,310
that I would not have to be helpdesk to

264
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:41,660
begin with you may ask yourself what is

265
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,670
stalker where or spouse where what are

266
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,520
these rats

267
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:49,890
that I was finding on on people's

268
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:54,640
computers and on their mobile phones

269
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:57,569
spouse where and stocker where is a sort

270
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,560
of commercial application which is sold

271
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:05,520
for the purpose of covertly spying on

272
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,810
someone's computer or mobile device

273
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,000
specifically without their knowledge and

274
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,739
sending you all of the information back

275
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,080
from that device mobile rats are

276
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,510
extremely popular for the same reason

277
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,480
that spying on phones is very popular

278
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:24,310
with with governments governments love

279
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,740
to spy on phones because you keep all of

280
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,810
your information inside your phone you

281
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,140
have you're carrying a tracking device

282
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:34,030
around in your pocket at all times

283
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,260
that's super useful for the government

284
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,959
if they'd like to know where you are

285
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,780
it's also super useful for a stalker or

286
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,330
a harasser or a former partner or an

287
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,589
abusive current partner if they want to

288
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,950
know where you are and they want to

289
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:51,670
control you you keep all of your

290
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:54,270
passwords in your phone you keep your

291
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,680
emails in your phone your text messages

292
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,569
obviously all of your voice phone calls

293
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,760
the thing which we still occasionally do

294
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,760
on a phone like if my mother calls me

295
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:09,939
phones are incredible sources of

296
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:13,060
information and you can use that

297
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,740
information to control people and just

298
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,869
as government's find this extremely

299
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,150
useful abusers find this useful as well

300
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,470
so how do we know that it is stalker

301
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,680
where and not some other kind of

302
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:26,860
application well we do a Google search

303
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,989

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:50,589
right up so you can see that like I've

310
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,180
already got a bunch of results here the

311
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,160

312

00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:05,738
you it's right there in the market copy

317
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:08,439

318
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,999
how to spy on your wife with ease you do

319
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:11,559
not have to worry about where she goes

320
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:14,319
who she talks to her the websites that

321
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:16,350
she visits mind you you really didn't

322
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:19,269
have to worry about these things before

323
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,639
probably shouldn't start now maybe have

324
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:26,769
a conversation with your wife spy on her

325
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:30,220
that's gross and as you can see the

326
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:33,789
marketing doesn't stop there this is a

327
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:38,019
screenshot from a mobile spy application

328
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:41,319
and the screenshot spends a bunch of

329
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:43,720
time describing how common cheating is

330
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:48,248
cheating extremely common in

331
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:51,639
relationships and it is accompanied by a

332
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:52,629
photograph of a man grabbing a woman in

333
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,220
a threatening manner

334
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:59,439
the woman is bruised and bleeding and

335
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,109
make no mistake this app is on the side

336
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:03,730
of the abuser this app is saying if you

337
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:05,079
want to be that abusive guy what you

338
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,759
should do is you should buy our app so

339
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:08,349
that you know whether or not that woman

340
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,339
is cheating on you and you can give her

341
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,739
a black eye

342
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:17,609
there is no question what this thing is

343
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:21,819
for now one of the big problems with

344
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:24,100
this use of spyware and stalker wear and

345
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:27,789
other types of rats is that for a very

346
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:33,279
long time hacker culture considered this

347
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:35,019
to be borderline acceptable there were a

348
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,439
lot of arguments that these apps

349
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:41,649
actually have legitimate uses some of

350
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:45,368
the very early work that I did on rats

351
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:49,569
being used to target activists and and

352
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:53,259
journalists in Syria who opposed the

353
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:57,549
Assad government involved a rack called

354
00:16:53,259 --> 00:17:01,329
dark comet so dark comet was a you know

355
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:03,970
free rat written by this guy jean-pierre

356
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:06,970
lesser whose name I will make sure no

357
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,519
one ever forgets and he went by the name

358
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,730
I think dark comet hacker just in case

359
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,339
you

360
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:17,169
wondering what it was that he developed

361
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:20,769
and in July of I think it was July of

362
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:27,309
2012 he shot down the dark comet project

363
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:31,149
and he said when I first built this rat

364
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:32,440
and made it available for free I thought

365
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,959
guys were just gonna use it to spy on

366
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,029
their girlfriends I didn't think it was

367
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,340
going to be used by governments to spy

368
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:40,600
on and you know I'm journalists and

369
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,908
activists I didn't think it was gonna

370
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,590
get anybody killed and he thought that

371
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:48,610
this was a really important distinction

372
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:53,590
I don't I think that if you are making

373
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:56,500
an app that allows abusive people to to

374
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:59,529
spy on their partners you are enabling

375
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,289
abuse you're enabling beatings you are

376
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:04,690
on the side of that guy holding the

377
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:07,860
woman who who is bruised and bleeding

378
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,899
and let there be no question of that

379
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,090
so for a very long time hacker cultures

380
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:14,590
seem to think that this was okay because

381
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,090
you know if your partner is cheating on

382
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,279
you then that's that's not like the

383
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:23,799
government spying on you the government

384
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:25,779
is bad so how can you tell the

385
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:28,418
difference between one of these stalker

386
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:33,399
where or spouse where apps and an app

387
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:36,220
like Find My iPhone or life 360 which is

388
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:37,779
geared towards families who want to keep

389
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,480
track of like where their children are

390
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:44,649
and that kind of thing and although the

391
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:47,230
apps that are designed to help you know

392
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:48,820
what your employees are doing if you are

393
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:54,850
running a business and you have given

394
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:56,860
them company issued device and I think

395
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,439
that the really the most important thing

396
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,350
the key to understanding the difference

397
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,130
between stalker where slash spouse where

398
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:10,240
and and these other kinds of kind of

399
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:13,029
dual use products is deception the point

400
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,690
of stalker where its spouse where is to

401
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:19,809
work covertly even if you need to have

402
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,299
the password and the username in order

403
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:26,049
to install the app

404
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:28,479
in the first place if afterwards it does

405
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:31,479
not remind the user that it is there and

406
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:34,299
it does not make it clear persistently

407
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:38,229
that this is an app this is what it's

408
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:41,589
called this is what it does then it is

409
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:43,779
deceptive and that is what makes it

410
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:48,969
stalker where or spouse where and that

411
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:50,979
is what makes it not okay so the next

412
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:54,579
thing that I did was I downloaded a

413
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:55,239
bunch of these apps and I went through

414
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:59,229
virustotal

415
00:19:55,239 --> 00:20:04,809
and I checked to see how many of the

416
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:08,259
sort of mobile antivirus companies were

417
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:10,059
actually picking these these apps up how

418
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:13,950
many of them were detecting them and I

419
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:16,418
got miserable results these are

420
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,950
screenshots from a test that I ran this

421
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:23,919
spring and as you can see we've got

422
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:28,539
result of seven out of sixty I think for

423
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:34,089
the truth spy and here is a slightly

424
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:38,019
better result which is 10 out of 61 but

425
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:41,739
still as a general rule if you have one

426
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:44,379
of these apps on your device and you

427
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:46,959
have antivirus and you run your

428
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:49,320
antivirus program and you say is there

429
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:53,259
something malicious on my on my device

430
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:56,559
the chances that that it will not be

431
00:20:53,259 --> 00:21:00,129
found as of this spring are extremely

432
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,440
high and I think that is a case of the

433
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:07,119
entire antivirus industry falling down

434
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:09,099
on the job so one of the first things

435
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:13,299
that happened after I after I published

436
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:17,529
this research was Kaspersky took one

437
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:20,320
look at it and felt bad so they made a

438
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:25,599
solemn vow the they were going to do a

439
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:27,570
better job of finding spouse ware and

440
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,249
stalker wear on people's devices and

441
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:33,249
they even came up with this new privacy

442
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:36,070
alert that goes up when you see this

443
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:38,530
potentially unwanted software

444
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,669
on your device so I thought that was

445
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,960
pretty great

446
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:46,270
they were followed shortly afterwards by

447
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,910
lookout which also has mobile products

448
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,290
so I care a lot about mobile TV I and

449
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,290
they basically said oh we have always

450
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,639
done this which you know I'll take it as

451
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,480
a win

452
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,840
and then finally malwarebytes published

453
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,060
both a a guide to you know how to find

454
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,300
spouse where on your devices that also

455
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,679
talked about account compromise and

456
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,810
talked about the ways in which they were

457
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,890
increasing their detection of

458
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:17,080
potentially unwanted programs on on

459
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:20,410
people's devices so this was a great

460
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,740
leap forward now I have something that I

461
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:26,170
can tell that I could tell survivors

462
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,790
when they come to me looking for

463
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,470
information I can tell them that this is

464
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,230
these are things that you can download

465
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:35,470
you can go looking for for these rats

466
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:39,040
and the chances that that they will be

467
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,530
found by these three AV services are

468
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,300
much much higher than they were this

469
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:48,190
spring that makes a big difference so

470
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,870
what can antivirus companies do assuming

471
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,680
that every single one of you is a

472
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:56,139
professional antivirus vendor again

473
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:58,750
detect detect spouse we're in stalker

474
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,330
where that's not particularly hard label

475
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,280
it as malicious let people know hey baby

476
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,659
you don't want this thing on your on

477
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,389
your phone maybe you don't want this

478
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,760
thing on your computer stay on top of it

479
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:14,050
so one of the biggest problems that I

480
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,970
saw was that if the sample was four to

481
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,790
six months old detection rates were

482
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:22,000
pretty high but for samples that were a

483
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:25,420
day old or two days old detection rates

484
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,090
were incredibly low and finally I'm

485
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:31,840
calling on the antivirus industry to

486
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:35,800
share samples because a rising tide

487
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,439
lifts all boats we will all do better if

488
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,620
we are protected from this kind of

489
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,170
software and not every AV company has to

490
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,729
reinvent the wheel every time so if you

491
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:48,220
find this stuff you should share it with

492
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,250
other AV companies and this kind of

493
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,170
protection should be

494
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:55,550
a cheap and easy and free Google by the

495
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,770
way I can do a better job of policing

496
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:01,389
the Google Playstore I have seen

497
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:05,360
multiple reports including I think from

498
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:08,390
most recently from Cornell showing that

499
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,399
these that both spouse we're on stalker

500
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,350
where in spite of the fact that it is in

501
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,020
violation of the Google Play stores

502
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,820
policies sometimes still sneaks in there

503
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,700
so Google does not do a particularly

504
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:23,210
good job of policing it it should not be

505
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:26,330
my job to go and find these apps in the

506
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,520
Play Store I am not paid by Google I

507
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:32,510
would be paid much better if I was paid

508
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:37,340
by Google I and I think that they should

509
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:40,820
put a person on this who is not what

510
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,070
could developers do so I assume I am in

511
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:46,490
a room full of people who occasionally

512
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:48,470
have a hand in making products once or

513
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,420
twice so some things that you can do is

514
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,950
you could have one page or tab where the

515
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,110
user can see all of the accounts that

516
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,300
have access to their data and what data

517
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,159
they have access to you can have one

518
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,990
pager tab that allows users to see what

519
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,420
devices and IP addresses have recently

520
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,100
logged into their account and most

521
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,500
importantly you can serve you can

522
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,469
support two-factor authentication for

523
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,360
logins and I would be especially happy

524
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:14,900
if it was something stronger than SMS

525
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,709
this is all I asked for I am simple to

526
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,810
please and next let's talk a little bit

527
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,190
about what governments can do first I

528
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:26,179
want to apologize for the fact that this

529
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:28,010
is mostly a US legal analysis i FF is a

530
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,590
law firm but we are a law firm based in

531
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,470
the United States I have an entire floor

532
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:37,280
of angry American attack lawyers who are

533
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,780
experts in US law so I will sort of skim

534
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,460
through this fairly quickly to give you

535
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,490
a general idea of what can be done and

536
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,260
then we can talk a little bit about how

537
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:49,040
this this framework could also be

538
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:50,750
applied to Romania or to the rest of

539
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,050
Europe or indeed for the rest of the

540
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:56,720
world so whenever somebody says there

541
00:25:54,050 --> 00:26:00,610
ought to be a law I am very suspicious

542
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,110
I've seen a lot of bad law written and

543
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,360
so when somebody tells me they're out of

544
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:10,510
like oh well let's look at the laws that

545
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:12,790
already exist so some federal laws that

546
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:15,379
stalker wear and spouse wear apps are

547
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:19,610
likely to be breaking at any given

548
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:22,880
moment just the federal addition the

549
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:25,010
United States has a has a sort of

550
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,230
government set up where there are laws

551
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,420
that apply to every state those are

552
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,840
federal laws and then there are state by

553
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:38,090
state laws so that's 50 more sets of

554
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:40,490
laws all of which apply so under federal

555
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,260
laws we have the federal wiretap Act we

556
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,600
also have the stored Communications Act

557
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:49,879
and of course the infamous Computer

558
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:52,780
Fraud and Abuse Act or the CFAA the e FF

559
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,610
frequently finds itself at odds with

560
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,668
with the US government prosecuting

561
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,860
hackers under the CFAA because

562
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:04,160
frequently this is a law that the US

563
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,639
government uses to allege that all kinds

564
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,650
of security research is actually hacking

565
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,929
but in this particular case if you are

566
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,760
covertly installing a rat on somebody

567
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:18,710
else's device in order to spy on them

568
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,770
yeah maybe you're violating the CFAA as

569
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:24,140
you can see here the US government has

570
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,760
in fact taken action against against

571
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,850
companies every once in a while

572
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,000
this was the webpage belonging to a

573
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:34,610
company called stealthGenie which was a

574
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,590
cell phone spy and monitoring app and as

575
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,949
you can see stealthGenie is no longer

576
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:45,620
available and the people who wrote it

577
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:48,530
went to jail so that was nice we also

578
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:52,549
have the FTC the Federal Trade

579
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:56,870
Commission the FTC has a authority under

580
00:27:52,549 --> 00:28:00,440
Section 5 which allows it to go after

581
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:05,570
companies who are engaged in fraudulent

582
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:08,900
or misleading trade practices now the

583
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:12,409
FTC has gone after I think two different

584
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:15,169
stop aware companies in the last since

585
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,770
about 2012 so in the last seven years

586
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:19,200
math is hard

587
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:22,070
I'm not an actually I'm an engineer I'm

588
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,390
an engineer who's as a calculator so

589
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,550
they've gone after two different

590
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:27,510
companies in the last in the last seven

591
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,960
years

592
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:32,520
one was a company that was covertly

593
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,570
installing key loggers

594
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:39,330
on on people's computers and the other

595
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:42,800
one was a company that was selling

596
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,300
spouse wear that included the ability to

597
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:49,110
[Music]

598
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:51,210
hide the application in in an image that

599
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,790
would then that would then covertly

600
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,820
download so this is very very clearly

601
00:28:53,790 --> 00:29:00,960
for malicious use and for the purpose of

602
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:02,370
fooling somebody into downloading than

603
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,160
to downloading the product onto their

604
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:09,419
device so most recently like two weeks

605
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,429
ago

606
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:15,540
the FTC took action against a company

607
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:17,790
called retina retina X retina X is a

608
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:21,559
stalker where and spouse we're a company

609
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:23,820
that mostly makes mobile products I and

610
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:27,030
what's particularly interesting about

611
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:31,770
the action that the FTC took was that

612
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:34,290
the FTC banned retina X from from making

613
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:37,920
or selling software until it could write

614
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:41,309
better and more secure software their

615
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,679
problem with retina X was not that they

616
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:46,500
were selling spouse wear it was that

617
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,400
they were selling bad spouse where they

618
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,750
had suffered a series of data breaches

619
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,910
over over the last several years

620
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:58,230
including breach of something like a

621
00:29:53,910 --> 00:30:01,020
petabyte of data made up of the of the

622
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:04,320
stuff that you know although all the

623
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:07,160
spying and so the FTC said if you cannot

624
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,629
secure this data which is being spied on

625
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,720
you you don't get to make a spouse were

626
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:15,090
or stalker where anymore so that is the

627
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:20,550
most recent action which the FTC has

628
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:22,559
taken now I'll take what I can get I am

629
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:25,500
happy that the US government has finally

630
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,330
decided that these are bad people I am

631
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,610
very excited that the FTC is taking

632
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,509
action but I would really like to see

633
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,820
them go a step further

634
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:34,859
I don't think there's any legitimate use

635
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,869
for these products and so I think going

636
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:39,089
after these companies just because

637
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:44,369
they're not doing a good job of being

638
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:45,539
bad is simply not enough and finally in

639
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:48,178
the United States we have a number of

640
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:50,940
state laws which apply there are state

641
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:55,859
wiretapping statutes there are two-party

642
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:57,839
consent laws I in in the United States

643
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:00,869
when you have when you have two people

644
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:04,139
who are engaged in a digital

645
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:07,019
communication there are some states in

646
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:09,539
which you cannot record it unless you

647
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:14,699
have the consent of all parties

648
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:16,679
so a an app which allows you to covertly

649
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:21,329
record somebody else's conversation is

650
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:25,049
de facto going to be violating the

651
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:27,389
two-party consent law and in the great

652
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:29,279
state of California we also have the

653
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:31,769
consumer protection against consumers

654
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,399
spyware Act so one of the things that

655
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:36,719
I've been calling on States to do in the

656
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,518
United States is to look at the

657
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:42,629
legislation that already exists and to

658
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:48,929
model their state legislation after the

659
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:52,799
after the CPA CSA just a terrible

660
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:55,019
terrible way of shortening it so yeah

661
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,519
those are those are the things that that

662
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:59,639
states can do and I would really like to

663
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,709
see other governments sort of model

664
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:05,339
their statutes on these existing the

665
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:09,359
statutes and then use them that would be

666
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:10,918
nice and finally we get to the most

667
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:16,678
important question which is what can you

668
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:18,479
do every single one of you has as Liam

669
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:25,589
Neeson once put it a very particular set

670
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:27,959
of skills and every one of you has a has

671
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:29,698
people that you care about you have

672
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:30,779
groups that you care about you have

673
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:33,989
groups that you feel that you're

674
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:39,959
affiliated with you may have a school or

675
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:43,260
an office or a church or you know loved

676
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:46,530
ones you may identify as

677
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:49,080
q you may have unpopular political or

678
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:52,920
religious beliefs there are always

679
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:56,879
people who need protection and it is my

680
00:32:52,920 --> 00:33:00,510
advice that you go out into the

681
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,390
communities that you care about and see

682
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:05,340
what they need the most important

683
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,960
takeaway like if you remember nothing

684
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,659
else about this talk and I assure you

685
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:16,020
you won't I want you to remember that

686
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:19,970
every assumption that I made about what

687
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:22,830
women needed in order to feel safe

688
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,440
initially after I read that after I read

689
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:28,620
the article with the interview was wrong

690
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,620
I thought I knew what people needed and

691
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:34,080
it took me a year and a half of working

692
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,959
with people one at a time to really look

693
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,949
at the bigger picture and understand

694
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:42,840
that what they needed was a big change

695
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,330
in the way that the antivirus industry

696
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:48,840
works and a big change in the way that

697
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:52,409
government enforces already existing

698
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:55,490
laws I instead of just somebody who will

699
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:58,200
show up and do forensic analysis because

700
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:02,040
most of us can do forensic analysis but

701
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,570
it takes a really long time and I would

702
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,649
really like for us to find more

703
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:10,110
efficient ways to do our work so now

704
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,399
let's talk a little bit about the about

705
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:15,600
the framework that I brought to this

706
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:18,659
problem again you do not personally have

707
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:22,440
to save every every woman who is a

708
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,929
victim of spousal abuse you don't have

709
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,450
to save everybody who is worried about

710
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:28,980
about domestic spying but you may have

711
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:30,928
some other sort of problem in us so I

712
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,719
recommend starting by formulating the

713
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,700
problem talking to and working with the

714
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,859
affected population if you do not get

715
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,870
down on the ground and work with the

716
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,730
people who are facing these problems you

717
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,830
are always going to be wrong about what

718
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,929
real problems they have then go back and

719
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:49,080
reformulate the problem because I've I

720
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:51,750
repeat you were wrong and then look for

721
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,730
ways that you can have an impact beyond

722
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,679
just helping one person at a time

723
00:34:53,730 --> 00:35:00,790
look for the engineer equivalent

724
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,380
of impact litigation the thing that I

725
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,359
really love about the hacking community

726
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,460
and about the infra sec community is

727
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:09,700
that we are such great systems thinkers

728
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:12,430
that often when we look at a problem we

729
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,529
are not looking at the about the tiny

730
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:17,319
details but we look at the whole thing

731
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:20,260
and when you look at the whole thing it

732
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:22,240
gives you the ability to see just where

733
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:26,460
you can push in order to make real

734
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,709
change I in architecture if you look at

735
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,829
if you look at an arch an arch is made

736
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:35,170
up of stones and the thing that keeps

737
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:37,480
the arch in place is called the Keystone

738
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,450
which is sort of a wedge-shaped stone in

739
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,609
the top and if you look at an arch you

740
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,680
know that if you take that stone out

741
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:47,440
right there the entire thing will

742
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,230
crumble the same thing is true of other

743
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,849
systems and I challenge every one of you

744
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,550
to look at the systems that you want to

745
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:59,470
change find that Keystone pull it right

746
00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:02,319
out finally the very last thing that I

747
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:03,419
want to say is that I don't do this by

748
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:07,150
myself

749
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:11,290
at EF F we have more than a hundred

750
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:15,130
employees I have I have a team of my own

751
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:18,250
which we call threat lab so shout out to

752
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:21,099
Dave Moss and Cooper Quintin who work

753
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:22,599
for me and more importantly there are

754
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:24,190
other people out in the community who

755
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:27,069
have been doing work on spouse war and

756
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:29,799
stalker where for years I specifically

757
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:33,579
would like to point to the work of

758
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:35,650
Harlow homes in New York who works for

759
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:38,520
the freedom of press foundation she's

760
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:42,640
been doing the sort of very difficult

761
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,369
one-on-one work for years there are also

762
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,319
the journalists at vices motherboard who

763
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,960
wrote a series of articles called when

764
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:52,900
spies come home which is specifically

765
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,760
about stalker wear and spouse where they

766
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,670
covered all of the data breaches that

767
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,710
retina acts is being held responsible

768
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,079
for right now and if it wasn't for their

769
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:04,170
coverage chances are that the FTC would

770
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,390
not have done anything about it at all

771
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:10,600
and those are the people that are really

772
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:13,150
doing the work and it is my hope

773
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,640
the next time that I give this talk that

774
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,410
I will add you to this list of people

775
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,319
who are doing the work or who are at

776
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:23,170
least working on something else because

777
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,690
every single one of you is capable I am

778
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:29,680
NOT a superhero I do not have any super

779
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:31,750
powers but you guys do and I want you to

780
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,060
go out now that I have radicalized you

781
00:37:31,750 --> 00:38:01,390
find that population that you want to

782
00:37:34,060 --> 00:38:03,400
help and go do it questions thank you

783
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:06,609
for the talk my question is whether

784
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:10,630
you've seen this product also marketed

785
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:12,610
as parental controls because I know from

786
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:15,070
journalists so from my coverage in the

787
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:18,400
past over the years of this type of

788
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:20,430
software I've seen cases where they are

789
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,620
using this parental control

790
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:25,509
functionality as justification for their

791
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:28,390
other functionality I mean you can use

792
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:31,390
it you can use it on on so they are

793
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:33,490
trying to make the user responsible for

794
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,319
how they use it right we created it it

795
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,819
has legitimate purposes like parental

796
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,350
control but if you choose to use it

797
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,380
against your wife or your girlfriend

798
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:45,069
that's on you that's basically some of

799
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:47,920
the yes I absolutely see this stuff

800
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:50,560
marketed as a is a tool of parental

801
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,180
control and at least in the United

802
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,630
States where I have my angry attack

803
00:38:52,180 --> 00:39:00,149
lawyers the right of parents to spy on

804
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:03,190
their children is not unlimited it's not

805
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,260
100% so even in those cases there are

806
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:11,260
not there there are cases which are not

807
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:13,060
legitimate furthermore just saying that

808
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,920
you're not responsible for how people

809
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,900
use your product because they clicked on

810
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,590
a EULA and promised they wouldn't misuse

811
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:22,970
it is some and there is a lot

812
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,040
of product liability law

813
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,410
and in the United States which covers

814
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,430
this and you can see sort of parallel

815
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:35,720
law that has developed in Europe so

816
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:39,410
we're we're not out of ways in which to

817
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,850
fight this and last of all the most

818
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,160
important thing don't spy on your

819
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:46,160
children just don't spy on your children

820
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:52,220
don't spy on your children using secret

821
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,690
you know hidden applications have a

822
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:58,490
conversation with them

823
00:39:53,690 --> 00:40:00,590
try try parenting parenting is good the

824
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,359
problem is that there are even security

825
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,100
companies who have parental control

826
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,750
software and they sell it as a

827
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,450
functionality of as part of their

828
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:12,260
endpoint security yes absolutely

829
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:14,600
and if if that software functions

830
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:18,350
covertly it is malicious and it should

831
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:36,560
be labeled malicious this is not an area

832
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:39,350
in which I compromise so I noticed

833
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,270
mostly was Android research yes if you

834
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:43,790
have any statistics on like iPhone or is

835
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,990
it because that jelly Apple's products

836
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,580
will like warn you that this house is

837
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,169
trying to use something something have

838
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:54,049
you seen less of a coverage on that one

839
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:59,420
or was it that I have in fact seen not

840
00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:02,680
just Android but also iOS malware which

841
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:06,800
is spouse wear and stalker wear I it is

842
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:10,759
increasingly difficult to to covertly

843
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,650
install this sort of thing on on iOS

844
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,440
devices and it's particularly difficult

845
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:17,180
to get it persistence so often when

846
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,710
people come to me with iOS devices that

847
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,750
they think are compromised the first

848
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:23,110
thing that I do is I tell them just like

849
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:25,550
turn it off and turn it on again and

850
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:27,140
often they they find it very difficult

851
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:31,340
to believe that this is an effective

852
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:34,009
solution and but the very last thing

853
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,210
that you should note is that the most

854
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,670
common way of

855
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:42,890
spying on iOS devices now is either

856
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:46,170
through find my friends or through

857
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:48,660
scraping iCloud backups scraping iCloud

858
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,760
backups is incredibly common especially

859
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:54,330
because in relationships people share

860
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:58,050
their Apple IDs and passwords not

861
00:41:54,330 --> 00:42:00,779
uncommon ly and also because if you have

862
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:02,460
been living with an abuser the chances

863
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:04,080
that they can guess your password that

864
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,750
they have shoulder surfed your password

865
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:11,670
that they know your the answers to your

866
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:14,430
security questions are you know not not

867
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:16,800
small and out of the products that

868
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:19,379
you've listed have any because because

869
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,990
of the way that it was modeled where did

870
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,570
any products that ever detected a rap

871
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:27,720
for instance on iOS pardon was there

872
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:30,619
ever a product that would attacked rat

873
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,629
on iOS in that generally they don't

874
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:36,089
initially most most AV companies that in

875
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:37,770
target iOS so that's what I'm asking if

876
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:39,029
there are out of the ones that you

877
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,800
identify for instance you don't have the

878
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,770
name or such but have some of them

879
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,820
proved to be efficient and detecting it

880
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:49,230
look at how the husband iOS product but

881
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:53,609
AV and iOS is very limited in what it

882
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:56,280
can do as you're well aware and so most

883
00:42:53,609 --> 00:43:17,040
of my arguing now happens directly with

884
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:20,990
Apple mental pressure of the entire

885
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:23,520
issue and the magnitude of it poorly

886
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,979
yeah now it's not the time to pretend

887
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,180
that I am a creature of tremendous grace

888
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,210
under pressure

889
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:32,339
who is incredibly heroic and can handle

890
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:38,300
this the whole reason I looked for ways

891
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:41,460
to to punch above my weight and to

892
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:43,200
change the entire system rather than

893
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,060
dealing with the problem one person at a

894
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,649
time is because dealing with the problem

895
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,400
one person at a time was slowly driving

896
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,050
me crazy

897
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:54,940
it is really hard to get up in the

898
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:59,410
and go through six or seven or nine or

899
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:01,780
twelve different stories from victims of

900
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:03,009
abuse telling you about the worst thing

901
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,920
that has ever happened to them

902
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:07,720
it is really rough and I have a lot of

903
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,780
admiration for the people who actually

904
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,609
do this for a living there is an

905
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:16,140
organization based out of Washington DC

906
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:18,880
called Operation safe escape that

907
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,580
specifically deals with women who are

908
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,400
trying to get out of out of abusive

909
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,930
relationships and they have a set of

910
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,210
people on staff who do nothing but help

911
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:32,830
people lock down their their devices and

912
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:34,720
that is a very very stressful job thank

913
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:38,529
you so much for this work and thank you

914
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,209
for empowering us to think to do more

915
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,710
systems thinking and to tackle this

916
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,810
issue and to hopefully contribute

917
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,500
whichever way we can thank you for being

918
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:49,900
here

919
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,900
