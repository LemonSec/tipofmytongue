1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,290
hello everybody let me start with a

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:12,870
question how many of you have Android

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:18,449
device cool and how many of you have at

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:22,049
least one Android device at home less

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,840
hands interesting in X 20 or so minutes

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,050
I will be talking about a new Android

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,990
banking Trojan called servers I divided

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,050
my talk into three main parts firstly I

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,839
would like to start with a story with a

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,169
background of servers then we move to

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,239
code analysis and finally I would like

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,879
to share some insight about the actual

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,809
campaign we have identified in the wild

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:53,250
in any set so if it is okay with you let

15
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,620
me start in June this year I have found

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,460
on one underground Russian forum new

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,209
post promoting new algid lee new banking

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:07,460
Trojan for Android called servers they

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,990
claimed they claimed it's a new

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,210
sophisticated a lot of features is not

21
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,298
detected by any AV company they can

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,460
create custom payloads for each client

23
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,470
written from the scratch and they have

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,509
been working on this malware for two

25
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,720
years and now they're coming public

26
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,090
which was some really weird also they

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,119
don't sell the source code only rent it

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,479
as a service and it's not cheap when we

29
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,790
compare price of servers with one of the

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,250
most recently popular Android banking

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,920
malware family called enemies an abyss

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,619
is for free since it was leaked and it's

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,540
open source it's open source now and

34
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,479
code is available on dozens of

35
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,720
underground forums and as I've seen in

36
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,299
the past many times bad guys scammers

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,850
will take the leaked or open source code

38
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,670
they rebrand it and then they try to

39
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,679
scam other scammers on such forums

40
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,930
claiming it's a new sophisticated you

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,880
should buy it from us actually the same

42
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,090
thing happened a couple days ago where

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,280
there is a new version of been amis and

44
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,440
I thought this is the same case scenario

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,860
because there was no proof Cerberus is

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,190
just

47
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,710
another animus so I went on Twitter and

48
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,350
I asked in for second community have you

49
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:26,730
heard about the servers do you have any

50
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:29,310
ash an example any CNC something that

51
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,040
would help us identify if this malware

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,500
is new or not

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,269
unfortunately no one heard about that

54
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:43,410
but because of this tweet actually

55
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:45,390
developers or PR team of servers reached

56
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,940
me and by the way for me it's the first

57
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,579
time I've seen promoting malware I

58
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,859
enjoyed malware outside of underground

59
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:58,410
forum guys actually have a Twitter

60
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,810
profile and they promoting it so it's

61
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,340
come back here because of this tweet

62
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,890
they actually reached me and they were

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,110
they were like okay Lucas if you want a

64
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:11,519
sample of our malware there is a way how

65
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:15,300
you can get it simply by it well I'm not

66
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,269
going to buy your malware they even

67
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,790
created me or posted a screenshot how my

68
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,190
admin panel would look like if I would

69
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,790
purchase so here's example how the admin

70
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,530
panel looks for first servers I took

71
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,298
advantage of that and I start to

72
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,190
communicate with them to get as many

73
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,440
information as possible what it is how

74
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,079
it works and maybe where the guys are

75
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,959
from because at that time we had no

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,450
information about the servers I found

77
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,950
out hard to tell it is true or not that

78
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,030
the guys developers are from Ukraine and

79
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,488
they even offer me a job

80
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,450
Lucas come to Ukraine and you can help

81
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,510
us build this malware they pay well they

82
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,399
offered me around five thousand years

83
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,170
but I'm not going to Ukraine to build a

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:07,410
malware I don't trust the scammers of

85
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:09,798
course well then I was simply asked if

86
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,079
it is possible to share a sample with me

87
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,570
they actually did they shared a sample

88
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,820
with me however this sample was

89
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,430
corrupted it was not working because

90
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,070
they exchanged the CNC channel that

91
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,640
points to two payload for my Twitter

92
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,610
handle but two days after they share a

93
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,469
sample

94
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,259
we need to identify the actual campaign

95
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:34,689
with a fully working servers about the

96
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,060
campaign I will be talking about in the

97
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:39,520
last part of my talk now let's move to

98
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:44,349
code analysis of this of this campaign

99
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:47,109
the workflow of servers is kind of

100
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:49,688
typical for Android banking Trojan there

101
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,840
is a dropper that contains envelope that

102
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,849
contains the encrypted code once

103
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,210
launched it would that decrypt the

104
00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:00,669
first-stage payload launch it then the

105
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,758
first-stage payload would come starts to

106
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:06,878
communicate with cnc and downloads the

107
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,219
custom-made module that's kind of

108
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:13,569
typical for all android banking Trojans

109
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:15,669
let's call it that way what happens from

110
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:19,389
the user perspective once user launches

111
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:22,750
such infiltration on device firstly

112
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:26,349
there are three checks the first one is

113
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,509
if it is running in a CIS countries

114
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:30,969
Commonwealth of Independence it would

115
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:33,039
simply quit it would not continue so if

116
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:35,979
the infected device is one from one of

117
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,990
these countries motor stops the second

118
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:41,199
check is if it is running if it is

119
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:45,639
running in emulation or not and the last

120
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:48,449
one is a check for a motion sensor it

121
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,250
means if the device actually makes steps

122
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:53,050
it belongs to actual user because we

123
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,990
carry our smart phone in pocket and bags

124
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,629
whatever and it will trigger the motion

125
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,150
sensor for malware researcher guys like

126
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:03,039
me or maybe many of you your testing

127
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,429
device just sits on the table all day

128
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,610
long once these three checks are

129
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,949
fulfilled malware then requests from a

130
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,919
user to activate accessibility services

131
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:18,610
on behalf of in this case Flash Player

132
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:20,469
for a user is some almost impossible to

133
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,810
tell if this request is really from

134
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:25,479
Flash Player or not because it could be

135
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,520
impersonating an Android system your

136
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:31,050
browser your a Google Play Store

137
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,549
whatever it's hard to tell for user

138
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,279
quickly what are accessibility services

139
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,949
they are on every Android device they

140
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:41,080
help visually impaired users disabled

141
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,240
users to reach text

142
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,830
was going on a reader notification which

143
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,819
application is running and many many

144
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:51,729
others and this is misused by servers

145
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:55,090
where it can perform clicks on behalf of

146
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:58,419
user it can hijack clicks to activate to

147
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,909
allow necessary permissions like send

148
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:04,479
text messages receive text messages make

149
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:06,639
phone calls then it can identify which

150
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,560
application is running is the banking

151
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:15,389
app or not and also key lock user input

152
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:19,389
to expand its reach servers used or uses

153
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:21,340
33 different languages so based on the

154
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:24,240
default language of your smartphone it

155
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,679
would pick the language and request to

156
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,930
activate accessibility services to look

157
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,909
more trustworthy like it's coming from

158
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:36,159
system once the accessibility services

159
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:38,110
are activated malware actually takes

160
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:41,590
control over the infected device and

161
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,020
then downloads the custom-made module

162
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,289
custom made module is the Dex file that

163
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,719
is stored in a private directory

164
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:52,360
containing the malicious functionality

165
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:56,169
then it would download injections for

166
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,139
targeted applications difference between

167
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:01,240
a servers and let's say an abyss one of

168
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,490
the most popular these days or Bank both

169
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,969
enemies download all the injections and

170
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,099
runs them locally where an abyss

171
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:11,379
actually displays them from a--from cnc

172
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:15,159
the benefit of that for servers is that

173
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:18,719
it works faster and also works much

174
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:21,669
better if you have slow laggy internet

175
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:23,469
servers can target a financial banking

176
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,349
applications crypto currency wallet

177
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:30,219
exchanges social media apps email

178
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:34,539
clients and that dozens others these

179
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:38,620
these days servers can target 90 banking

180
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:41,439
apps from these countries besides

181
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,909
banking apps it also targets or can the

182
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,970
requests or the goal of that is to

183
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:48,720
request them credentials for particular

184
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:52,480
banking applications servers can also

185
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,100
lure victim credit card details on

186
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,280
behalf of

187
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,620
social media applications it means once

188
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,079
you once your device is infected you

189
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,300
launch one of these apps first there is

190
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,640
a request looks like it's coming from

191
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,500
the particular app so let's say you open

192
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,020
the telegram first there is a request

193
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,820
insert your credit card details because

194
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:18,579
we in telegram need that it's a new

195
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:21,130
policy and also lures credentials for

196
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,020
email clients that's the core

197
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,230
functionality of any Android banking

198
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,800
Trojan including the servers quickly how

199
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,510
it works

200
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,699
user launches let's say one of the

201
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,400
targeted apps I just mentioned like the

202
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,070
Gmail once user launches the Gmail

203
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,260
malware identifies that Gmail was

204
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,600
launched by misusing accessibility

205
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,360
services this plays the injection and

206
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,270
the injection overlays legitimate

207
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,430
application requesting credentials

208
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:51,610
servers can also bypass SMS two-factor

209
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,650
authentication and one-time codes as I

210
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,000
said is the core functionality

211
00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,510
besides that servers can trigger 13

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,240
different commands on infected device

213
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:06,640
the most interesting ones are send

214
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,790
receive text messages make phone calls

215
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,040
forward phone calls Lock device key lock

216
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:16,380
user input now I go through a couple of

217
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:20,319
features or functionalities servers has

218
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:22,560
like locking the device this is not a

219
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,650
ransom one feature in banking Trojan

220
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,380
this feature is launched by the attacker

221
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:31,390
it's kind of cashing out zone it means

222
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,760
where when if they if the attacker

223
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,010
already obtained credentials for their

224
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,040
banking app you can intercept one time

225
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,430
codes coming in a text message you can

226
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,930
remotely lock the device victims device

227
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,000
by muting down all the notifications

228
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,060
like receive text messages or phone

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,880
calls coming from your bank about weird

230
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,430
transactions and then it will lock the

231
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,400
device every 10 milliseconds for user

232
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,290
for victim is impossible to get back to

233
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,829
your smartphone on the other side the

234
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,290
attacker is making transactions to stay

235
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,020
on infected device as long as possible

236
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,540
servers uses a persistence technique

237
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,240
again by misusing accessibility services

238
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,900
right after start it would activate to

239
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,029
itself device administrator rights it

240
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,220
means for the user for the victim that

241
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:23,170
there are a couple extra steps he needs

242
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,260
to go through to uninstall do the

243
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:30,839
infiltration disables google play

244
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:33,610
protect disables manual uninstallation

245
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,100
it means when user wants to go to

246
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,050
settings apps or app manager and

247
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,640
manually search for let's say the Flash

248
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,010
Player it's impossible because such

249
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,500
activity is killed and controlled by the

250
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:49,420
servers blocks launch of security apps

251
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,390
at the first version I've analyzed there

252
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,130
was a default the Xiaomi UI security

253
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,380
solution that was it wasn't it wasn't

254
00:11:54,130 --> 00:12:03,370
possible to launch it if Cerberus was

255
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:06,100
already installed even though there is a

256
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,770
persistence on affected device by used

257
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,740
by servers servers can also sell

258
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,480
destruct itself by receiving command to

259
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,830
remove the device administrator and

260
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,390
uninstall uninstall itself in the first

261
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,089
sample I analyzed there actually wasn't

262
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:25,350
the code for uninstalling it itself but

263
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:28,800
there is no problem to implement that

264
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:32,140
now the question is how to remove that

265
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,689
is it possible yes it is there are

266
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,339
actually two ways how to remove servers

267
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,580
from infected device or any other

268
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:43,000
Android banking Trojan the easiest one

269
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,980
is through Safe Mode you go through safe

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,580
mode of your smartphone go to settings

271
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:51,190
apps search for the app remove that why

272
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,770
because in safe mode third-party apps

273
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,450
installed by the user are not launched

274
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,380
or not triggered and because of that

275
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:01,600
persistence cannot be applied the second

276
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,459
one is through Android debug bridge

277
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,890
commands where you connect your

278
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:08,109
smartphone to your PC and from your PC

279
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,779
you dance and adb commands to identify

280
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:14,380
which application is running to force

281
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:16,630
stop the application and uninstall it so

282
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,590
these are two two ways

283
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,930
now let's go through a couple of

284
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:24,290
highlights of servers could use this

285
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,800
tour as a CNC but many recent banking

286
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:30,819
Trojans on Android platform does that

287
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,459
they also offer apk builder

288
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,140
it means that potential client don't

289
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,330
need to know how to develop how to

290
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,100
create how to compile Android apps

291
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,380
simply put it all together using

292
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,720
drag-and-drop and you have your output

293
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,110
just just spread it out the same applies

294
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,450
to injections you can you don't need to

295
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,400
know how HTML Javascript ale works you

296
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,920
simply drag-and-drop create custom

297
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,250
injection and make it make it work in

298
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:02,300
your apk also in September they shared

299
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,640
they have as I said 90 targeted banking

300
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,709
apps with this particular injections if

301
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:12,380
you want more injections you have to pay

302
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:15,140
extra we have a good support they are

303
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,450
willing to create a new features for

304
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,610
their customers new injections and they

305
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,800
are looking for for athletes they have

306
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,530
social media as I mentioned the Twitter

307
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,800
and recently I found out they also have

308
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:31,810
a telegram bot so looks like these guys

309
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,810
are not afraid of getting caught and

310
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:40,070
here's example of the actual cnc for for

311
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:43,219
the servers that's it for coat analysis

312
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,950
of servers now let's move to actual

313
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,290
campaign we identified in any set it's

314
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:53,570
one of the first first campaign of

315
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:55,670
Cerberus being used in the wild servers

316
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,070
was published in the end of the June and

317
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,569
in July we identify the campaign the

318
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:04,460
campaign was spread by malicious link

319
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,440
that claimed there is some media content

320
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,690
but if you want to watch the content

321
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,050
first you need to download and install

322
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:15,650
Adobe Flash Player once installed device

323
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,420
is is affected because of the URL

324
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,880
because of the link where servers was

325
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:23,870
spread I've seen such frameworks are

326
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,810
such back-end in the past and this is

327
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,690
framework is actually leaking statistics

328
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,300
about the website visits it

329
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:35,570
that's for website visits unique website

330
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,979
visits and countries were from this

331
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,410
clicks we're coming

332
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,470
based on that we could identify that the

333
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:45,860
campaign started in Japan in Japan with

334
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:48,380
over 9000 website clicks within 24 hours

335
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:53,180
and then it moved from Japan to the

336
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:57,950
United States within a 14 days there

337
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:01,699
were over 13,000 website clicks now I

338
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:04,640
have prepared a video demonstration from

339
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:07,760
this actual campaign in the video you'll

340
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,680
see how it how it looks what user has to

341
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,250
go through what has to download activate

342
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:17,420
and the actual fishing of using actual

343
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:20,360
injection so potential victim receives

344
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,459
the link either from social media from

345
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,050
telegram viber whatever there's some

346
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:27,910
video content but first you need to

347
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,910
download and install Adobe Flash Player

348
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,349
once you install the Flash Player open

349
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,190
that there is no request for any

350
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,540
activation of permissions or whatsoever

351
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,930
but there is a request to activate

352
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:45,819
accessibility services for Adobe Flash

353
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:48,760
Player once this is done

354
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,380
malware starts to communicate with cnc

355
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:55,910
downloads the payload downloads the

356
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:57,470
injections and enables all the necessary

357
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,060
permissions like send receive text

358
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,640
messages phone calls make phone calls

359
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,739
and and others and now waits for user to

360
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,889
launch one of the targeted banking apps

361
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,620
i will demonstrate that by launching one

362
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,390
of the financial application open the

363
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:13,698
app and this is the fake screen the

364
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,010
injection that belongs to flash player

365
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,199
and the injection actually overlaid the

366
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,609
original application launched lodged by

367
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,310
the user now we check the permissions

368
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,530
and all the necessary permissions were

369
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,810
activated even though user haven't

370
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:30,459
activated them this was done by malware

371
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,458
is using accessibility services

372
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,560
so that was one of the first campaigns

373
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:39,540
of enemies definitely not the last

374
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,210
because last week a Polish search

375
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:45,240
actually published a blog that same

376
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,060
thing is spreading in Poland same

377
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,150
malware servers so it's still ongoing

378
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,129
they have clients off of their malware

379
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:59,060
even though it's a really really

380
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:59,060
expensive now we're coming to conclusion

381
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,290
its new published in the end of the June

382
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,760
expensive as I said but they have

383
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,310
already clients the distribution the

384
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,410
campaigns are actually out there not

385
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:14,669
only in the Japan stays in Poland but

386
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:17,610
also in other countries based on the

387
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,590
code analysis it's looks like it's

388
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,409
written from the scratch it knots it is

389
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,669
not based on enemies only some part were

390
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:28,620
picked or got inspired by by enemies

391
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:32,010
you cannot have the source code on

392
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,750
malware as a throat as a service they

393
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,560
have good support they're willing to

394
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,330
create new features new injections they

395
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,800
have social media they are not afraid of

396
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:46,620
being caught as I pointed servers

397
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,740
downloads all the injections to to have

398
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,629
them locally compare that to an abyss

399
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,580
that downloads them from CNC it works

400
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:58,020
much faster much better without lag

401
00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:00,659
internet not easy to remove as you saw

402
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,830
there are only two ways either going to

403
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:07,830
safe mode or using adb commands by the

404
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:10,889
way this research was not published by

405
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:13,169
by ESET or by me they were too slow why

406
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,020
we were researching and the guys from a

407
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,700
flat fabric kudos to them they actually

408
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,770
published the blog post and I advise you

409
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,540
to check it out it's really great here

410
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,240
is a link where you can find more

411
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:28,220
details more tech details about the

412
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,220
malware so feel free to check it out

413
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,610
that's a term from from my part thank

414
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,990
you very much and if you have any

415
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,990
questions feel feel free to ask

416
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:45,110
all right let's take a few questions and

417
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,670
let's start from the back this time

418
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,939
because we've started from the front up

419
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,940
to now

420
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:07,179
hello I know that was app servers who

421
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,550
used to find the kids or family was

422
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:16,270
something like this is this related to

423
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:18,010
that app it will it's very used I'm

424
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:22,080
sorry I haven't catched the question

425
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:27,570
from a circus circus app no the same app

426
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:32,320
servers is well-known in my opinion

427
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:37,000
happy used to find the kids family

428
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:42,370
remote locator and is used by many many

429
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,950
years in my knowledge is any connection

430
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:51,070
between that servers and this servers

431
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:53,860
the name is the identical there

432
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,659
shouldn't be any connection because the

433
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,309
one here you mentioned it's some kind of

434
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:02,320
for tracking let's go that way

435
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:05,649
yes it's totally different thing saying

436
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:11,020
so maybe they are using his name

437
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:12,760
connection to buy two key interest yeah

438
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,639
only the name is the connection video

439
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,470
with that and yes so many many people

440
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,290
actually thinking that they have the

441
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,929
servers and does it mean that I have the

442
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:26,520
banking Trojan well no it's not it's

443
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:26,520
it's a totally clean thing thank you

444
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:38,420
another question I just a short question

445
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,970
does the server smuggler

446
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:45,440
make use of extended functionality that

447
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:48,910
comes with the rooted device not for now

448
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,290
or at least I haven't seen miss using

449
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,150
let's say functionality or even routing

450
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,040
the device these days but they claim

451
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,680
hard to tell if it is sure now today

452
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,320
that that they can create custom

453
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,510
payloads and I believe if you pay they

454
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,810
are willing to implement maybe even

455
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,129
exploiting or using by using a routing

456
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,649
functionalities like stealing or

457
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:13,760
Facebook communication or something okay

458
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:15,620
just one follow-up question as far as I

459
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,860
know there is an Android malware that

460
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,219
can survive a complete wipe is it the

461
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:26,929
case with Cerberus

462
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:30,260
Mulder also know it's not the case with

463
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,910
the server's okay thank you let's keep

464
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:39,170
the trend of the short questions and

465
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:41,540
take two from up front hello thank you

466
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,420
for the interesting presentation I have

467
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:49,870
one question about custom roms or new

468
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:53,630
Android versions are they more secure or

469
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:56,600
has there have to be a compatibility in

470
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:59,330
the sense of an older Android version is

471
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:04,540
more unsecure in these cases for an

472
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:06,770
attack custom roms have their benefits

473
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:11,899
hard to tell if they're more secure or

474
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:16,340
not I see one benefit that many people

475
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:18,770
they are into privacy they don't want to

476
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,500
have Google services on their smartphone

477
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:24,530
they use f-droid market to download apps

478
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,510
so they don't want to send no data to

479
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,940
Google whatsoever that's like the one

480
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:32,930
really interesting goal why to download

481
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:34,130
there are the custom roms if it's hard

482
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,110
to tell if they're more secure or not

483
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,810
because you have to go through that you

484
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:41,810
have to analyze that because I know

485
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:44,810
banking app and the

486
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:47,929
it the launch on it on a custom rom

487
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:55,580
device but they permit on a rooted

488
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:58,520
device for example so it's like yes but

489
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,919
from their perspective if they would at

490
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,830
least at once included some bad

491
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,750
malicious app tracking app they would be

492
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,179
done in my opinion because someone was

493
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,400
found out and their business let's call

494
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,680
it that way would be done for them

495
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,230
that's I don't build a call maybe

496
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:19,210
someone can misuse that like if they

497
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:21,500
import or use from third-party apps or

498
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,940
something else that they include in in

499
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,290
their rooms but I don't believe this is

500
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:29,360
the direct thing to you know think about

501
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,510
that it's well there could be a malware

502
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:38,899
or not all right

503
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:40,970
last question before the break thank you

504
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,280
for your presentation if I may ask

505
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,830
you've mentioned that they are not

506
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:49,010
afraid to be caught do you perceive an

507
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:51,850
expiration date and how is it involved

508
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:56,360
in this case do you take any next steps

509
00:24:51,850 --> 00:25:01,340
thank you well our main goal is to

510
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:03,620
protect our clients we are not working

511
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:08,870
or in this case whenever the police or

512
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:10,909
for law enforcement agencies it's it's

513
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,520
not so easy to to point a finger and

514
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,650
well this one is actually responsible

515
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,740
for creating for spreading distributing

516
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,360
malware but yeah we are willing to to

517
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:26,630
share information or knowledge and

518
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:31,270
cooperate all right thank you very much

519
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:31,270

520
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,889
