1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,958
he's an experienced cybersecurity

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,609
manager with more than 10 years of

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,820
practice and he's gathered this

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:11,129
experience by working in EU level

agencies as well as in the academic and

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,779
private sector in the last eight years

8
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,080
dan has had different cybersecurity

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:26,359
roles such as technical director at cert

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,948
row and major incident response

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:32,369
reporting responsible sorry it's been a

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,649
long two days within Anisa currently he

13
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,219
is a security program manager for secure

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,710
works and hopefully he'll help us answer

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,680
one of the more challenging questions in

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,350
cybersecurity which is why haven't we

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:56,579
solved security yet so please welcome

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:01:04,460
Dan tough on kaspersky and some names

19
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:04,460
and some dates okay

20
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,530
so hi hi everybody you are all heroes

21
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,380
this is the last presentation you know

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,630
so I mean you could have gone a long

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,940
time ago you really like this No so you

24
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:23,990
enjoyed it huh okay

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:28,039
so I'm done and we're going to talk

26
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:32,929
about we're going to do a bit of how to

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,270
call it but deep dive into cybersecurity

28
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,789
is something that is not technical so I

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,470
think I believe I will take you to areas

30
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:42,500
where you haven't been before looking at

31
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,929
the bigger picture as you said looking

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,850
into the short history of the of the of

33
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,170
cybersecurity the business analysis and

34
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,149
the drop of technical assessment I think

35
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,190
you had enough of technical assessments

36
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:53,690
today enough technical presentation so

37
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,590
we're not going to touch too much

38
00:01:53,690 --> 00:02:00,380
technical stuff here so you already did

39
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,000
my intro so I worked in cert Romania for

40
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,830
a couple of years then Anisa the US

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,470
Cyber Security Agency and then now I'm

42
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:10,910
security security program manager here

43
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:15,019
in SEO II that's the Romanian Bucharest

44
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:17,120
branch of of secure works so about

45
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:19,130
secure works you have seen probably some

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,970
of these tats from my previous colleague

47
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,680
that was yesterday Chris you so we are a

48
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,980
global cyber security company offering

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,130
all kinds of services to all kinds of

50
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:35,030
customers around 4,000 customers

51
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:38,470
worldwide 310 billions of security

52
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,880
events that we process daily 600 plus

53
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:45,440
security analysts only in Bucharest and

54
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:47,480
around 2000 worldwide 20 plus of history

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:53,630
behind 20 years plus of history behind

56
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:59,929
so we have a lot of telemetry ok a bit

57
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:02,290
of security in the news that we had this

58
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,290
year

59
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:10,319
and let's go down to business now so

60
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:13,049
short history how it all started so you

61
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,879
know you all guys like me because I do

62
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:20,730
consider now that I'm an old guy I'm not

63
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,858
gonna fall price history a bit because

64
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,260
it's important it's important to know

65
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:28,290
where you started and it's a way to

66
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,569
maybe determine well you will reach so

67
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,129
we started in 1953 with the first

68
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:37,730
commercial computer IBM 701 and then 20

69
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,260
around 20 years after we realized

70
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,629
humanity when I say we it's not me or

71
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,730
security necessarily so we realized that

72
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,649
we can connect computers into networks

73
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,439
and then we had our phonetic lattice and

74
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,739
Telenet and then in 71 the first virus

75
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:56,430
appeared one year after so not too long

76
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:58,680
away creeper was not actually a virus so

77
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,590
it was you know the guys there they just

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,750
wanted to see if you can program a

79
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:09,000
software to to run from a computer to

80
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,949
another one I'll have to call it to go

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,199
from one to another so they just tried

82
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,180
it try that and they succeeded and it

83
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,099
went out of control of course and then

84
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,900
they had to make another virus which was

85
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:22,289
called creeper just to eliminate the

86
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:24,060
first one in 1982 tcp/ip became a

87
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:25,889
standard so everybody was talking the

88
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,440
same language and then we had more

89
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:32,130
viruses and then we had morris worm

90
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,099
which basically started the first it was

91
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,949
the the start of the first let's say

92
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:39,870
bigger action against cyber security

93
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,729
cyber crime let's say it was not crime

94
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,159
at that point it not even Morris it was

95
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:46,710
not necessarily they didn't have

96
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,599
malicious intentions so it was search

97
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,758
CC's of the cert Coordination Center the

98
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:54,120
Carnegie Mellon one was established and

99
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,639
then Internet in 1995 Internet was about

100
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,770
5.8 million hosts so it was not too

101
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,330
large 1999 security appeals of the

102
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,340
business industry the security business

103
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,880
industry starting started to appear and

104
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,008
to grow and then we have 2000 we started

105
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,479
we have started seeing several companies

106
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:16,919
being attacked and then in 2001 it's a

107
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,150
milestone because the

108
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:24,240
realized the potential the potential

109
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,409
damage the cybercrime can do and they we

110
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,830
had the Budapest Convention of

111
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:30,240
cybercrime which is now translated in

112
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,568
laws and national laws in many countries

113
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,349
above 100 140 and something and then we

114
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,020
have botnets

115
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:39,150
appeared 2003 and then we have the first

116
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,370
country getting attacked 2007 Estonia

117
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,590
and then we have configure so more

118
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,569
victims more botnets more malware and

119
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,388
then we have Stuxnet the first cyber

120
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:54,300
weapon in 2010 so everything grows grows

121
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:55,949
grows in it grows and then we had Sony

122
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,930
Playstation attack that was mentioned

123
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,879
before in the plantation before what

124
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,560
Sony Playstation attack what this attack

125
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,810
managed to bring to our attention is

126
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,400
that you know it brought cyber security

127
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,439
to the main agenda to the business

128
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,529
agenda because because people realized

129
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:13,229
man they can really take us down with a

130
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:16,349
cyber attack and Sony was a big company

131
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:18,810
I mean they still are they still are so

132
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:21,509
and then we had the Snowden effect so

133
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:26,539
you know the whistleblowers people

134
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:31,139
starting to you know revolt against in

135
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:34,440
justice done by some in some areas and

136
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:37,080
then we had heartbleed bug so what you

137
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,129
can do with a small bug like this and

138
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:44,000
then we have a big move from NATO which

139
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,620
declares in 2016 which declares the

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,839
cyber as the new battlefield so now we

141
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:55,289
have four or five of them so it's air

142
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:59,759
land water and cyber and then we have

143
00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:02,099
eternal blue so the one below 2017 the

144
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,710
leaked exploit from from NSA and then we

145
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:08,400
have would want to cry and then in 2018

146
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:10,020
EU first made it's also a first move not

147
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,698
necessarily the first but a big move in

148
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:17,698
this area with the N eyes directive and

149
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:20,339
the the GDP are so if you take it from

150
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,719
the beginning until the end a graphical

151
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,490
representation of what happened we

152
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:28,099
looked like this so we started small

153
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,689
with insignificant malware not targeting

154
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:32,029
financial aspects

155
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:33,739
mainly then we go to identity theft

156
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:37,069
Beijing 2004

157
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:39,529
Oh 2007 and then we attacks becoming

158
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:41,860
more complex and then even more complex

159
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:45,499
and present-day when you have keylogger

160
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,599
Bitcoin wallet ransomware cyber warfare

161
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:50,059
so we thought we are talking about cyber

162
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:54,649
warfare now so things are becoming more

163
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:56,509
and more complicated this is a chart

164
00:07:54,649 --> 00:08:02,989
showing you the threat actors evolution

165
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:04,579
so it dates back from 2010 before 2010

166
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:08,568
it was not organized crime in the first

167
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:11,239
place it was mainly not even activists

168
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:13,759
it was kiddies I mean it was different

169
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:15,409
but now we have organized crime so

170
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,289
organized crime realized the potential

171
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:22,159
of the of this let's call it business

172
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:23,779
and they started taking advantage of of

173
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,149
it and then we have state-affiliated

174
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:32,500
means meaning that they also realize

175
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:34,669
this is they didn't know so this is a

176
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,360
then a picture showing you the data

177
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:39,860
breach evolution and I'm you can find me

178
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,500
in all the slides you will find in the

179
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,600
notes the the sources so we can find

180
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,189
this online and basically you will see

181
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,439
you'll have here you know if you have

182
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:50,839
laser it's not very visible so we have

183
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:53,870
the ear another year another year and

184
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,750
many bubbles meaning a breach and the

185
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:59,209
bigger the bubble the bigger the bridge

186
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:04,100
so it's all getting worse you have more

187
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:06,378
and bigger bubbles so as conclusions on

188
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,269
the history part on the historical part

189
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,459
so fast growth led by the expansion of

190
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:13,250
the internet increase in sophistication

191
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:15,319
and volume so more and more and more

192
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,300
sophisticated so they become complex

193
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:20,180
they become real experts in what they do

194
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,279
hackers and also the defenders and the

195
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,170
switching business motives so we we go

196
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:29,089
to script kiddies to to nation-states we

197
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:31,219
go to the second part now which is the

198
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:35,360
business analysis and we're going to

199
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,179
look into five metrics like the incident

200
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,329
costs the spending that we do on cyber

201
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:42,270
the investments the budget and the

202
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,430
workforce

203
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,810
you'll have some stats here again you

204
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,199
have the sources you can check them out

205
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:52,670
later so incident cost there are

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,750
different you know there are different

207
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,550
statistics or figures out there

208
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:01,380
regarding the incident cost and they

209
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:03,779
they vary a lot from experience I can

210
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,430
tell you that I mean I've done stuff

211
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,589
like that working for Aneesa

212
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,839
so incident costs whenever you find it

213
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,910
it's not very reliable indicator or a

214
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,570
metric because you can never measure the

215
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,300
incident cost very accurate but there

216
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:21,390
are people saying that by 2021 we will

217
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,260
have a six trillion damage cost per year

218
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:29,040
then they say that it's a 3.85 86

219
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:31,410
million average cost per data breach and

220
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:40,469
a 30 million average cost per company

221
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:44,640
per year this is the slide related to

222
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,650
the incident cost so 145 number of

223
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,000
security breaches per company this is

224
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:54,750
the average that they say and 13 million

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:03,089
the average cost so it varies from 2018

226
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:06,870
is this one so from 8 to 18 point 0.5 it

227
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:10,170
depends on the industry okay we go back

228
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:15,900
to spending so spending we have another

229
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:19,560
estimate of 120 billion dollars per year

230
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:21,959
total spending in cyber security is this

231
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,779
big small how do you think what do you

232
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:30,920
think about this do you know what's the

233
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:30,920
GDP of Romania or is the GDP of Romania

234
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:42,040
160 billion dollars so they are almost

235
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:44,800
there and one trillion estimate until

236
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,949
2021 so basically they say it will it

237
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,319
will grow it will grow it will grow the

238
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:56,230
spending slide I have no I don't have a

239
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:58,660
spending slide sorry okay we go to

240
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:04,420
investment investment I have this slide

241
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:06,280
for investments in 2018 we had

242
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,689
investments the ones that were recorded

243
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,770
and the ones that were big enough to

244
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:13,800
matter of five billion dollars but 350

245
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,689
companies globally

246
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,430
and you can see it's growing they have

247
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:26,580
we have statistics since 2004 2014 and

248
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:26,579
it's growing a steady growing as we say

249
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,170
sorry and then we go to budget so how

250
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:37,209
much do we spend on cybersecurity and

251
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,490
you're not gonna find an accurate figure

252
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,840
because of course it depends on from

253
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,580
company to company there are small

254
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,860
companies big companies but you will

255
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:52,120
find percentages out of total IT budget

256
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:55,630
and on this area we have this slide

257
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,520
showing you that it's up to three thirty

258
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,160
eight percent of the total IT budget

259
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,260
that goes into cyber security you will

260
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,300
find newer sources that mention that

261
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,560
it's even higher than the total IT

262
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:11,890
budget the cyber security it depends

263
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,130
again from company to company but what

264
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,689
we have a secure works is this it

265
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,420
depends it depends again on the branch

266
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,850
of the on the industry retail being the

267
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:28,060
first one then telecom technology

268
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:29,830
manufacturing on the third place and

269
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,250
then we go to the skill gap I mean

270
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,200
basically you can see to the skill gap I

271
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,510
mean even if you go here around the

272
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,250
corner to the other room where you have

273
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,530
the stands you'll see everybody trying

274
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,990
to hire people so there is a skill gap

275
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:47,470
we don't know how big it is

276
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:50,350
some say it's 3.5 million unfilled jobs

277
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,360
by 2021

278
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,270
there are other articles there that

279
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,460
don't give exact figures based on our

280
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:03,939
secure work statistics is about around

281
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:08,440
1.8 million jobs that are unfilled at

282
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:10,180
this point and then there is the

283
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,590
cybersecurity landscape the vendor

284
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,849
landscape I'm pretty sure you're

285
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,230
familiar with this is pretty popular

286
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:20,530
this this cyber scape or how they call

287
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,180
it the vendor landscape what is showing

288
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,800
you and basically what is the conclusion

289
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,829
drawn by the industry on this slide is

290
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,959
that we are pretty much fragmented so we

291
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,400
there are a lot of categories I mean we

292
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,320
do have categories as an industry

293
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,030
because we have become an industry cyber

294
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,560
security we have categories like

295
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:40,140
endpoint firewalls you know services

296
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,910
[Music]

297
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,890
pretty fragmented you don't really have

298
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,530
a leader none of the categories there

299
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,630
are leaders in some of them but as

300
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,600
security for example is recognized by

301
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:54,780
Gartner as one in in many service

302
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,910
providers but you know the struggle is

303
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,310
is still there so there are a lot of

304
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:03,360
others that can come on top

305
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:05,760
and by the way from the 120 billion

306
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,180
dollars that are spending in

307
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,420
cybersecurity half of them so 60 they go

308
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:18,599
only on services and the other half is

309
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:21,150
let's call it solutions and now just a

310
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,950
picture to show you the magnitude of the

311
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:29,480
cyber security industry compared to

312
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:33,650
others can you find cyber security there

313
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,180
is it it's not because we're too small

314
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,069
so on the global scale cyber security is

315
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,589
still very small

316
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:44,460
it's inexistent compared to this of

317
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:46,830
course and you find that you are

318
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,650
pre-baby you might be familiar with

319
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:59,160
cryptocurrencies which is they say 0.5

320
00:15:49,650 --> 00:16:01,890
Billy trillions so they are above us ok

321
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,510
conclusions on the business analysis so

322
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,970
colossal values when talking about the

323
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:08,819
costs and not necessarily trustworthy I

324
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,490
can tell you that around 140 billion

325
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:15,840
spending per year and increasing in

326
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:18,090
cyber security so global spending 50% of

327
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,870
this is on security operations so

328
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:23,700
services done global investments about 5

329
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,820
billion in 2019

330
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,430
skill in the workforce gap is on the

331
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,070
rise so we have won a big one a pretty

332
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,270
big one and it's on the rise security

333
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,430
market highly fragmented

334
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,590
and the worries about the cyber security

335
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,180
bubble I'm not going to go into that

336
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,440
because it's a very long discussion and

337
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,430
we don't have the the proof let's say to

338
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,060
demonstrate that we have a bubble or you

339
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,060
don't have a bubble

340
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:56,449
now on the technical assessment you know

341
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:56,449
what this is maybe among the old guys

342
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,490
this is the creeper the first virus this

343
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,640
is what it was doing I mean just blank

344
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:09,599
screen with some text and this is the

345
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:14,990
source code pretty simple at that point

346
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:17,760
at that time now when we talk about

347
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,789
antivirus or how we call it anti-malware

348
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,559
it's a much it's a bit more complicated

349
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:25,650
and I'm not going to go into those

350
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,959
details I just have some some graphical

351
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,750
representation here from our partners

352
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,039
carbon black but it's much more

353
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,350
complicated than that

354
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,480
it goes into behavioral analysis we are

355
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,850
way beyond the detection based on

356
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,309
signatures so it's much more complicated

357
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:44,158
so what I wanted to emphasize is that

358
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:46,200
industry is evolving so if you look into

359
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:47,850
other the time is limited and I couldn't

360
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,830
go into other solutions but if you go in

361
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,830
far all the evolutions also we started

362
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,360
from basic packet filtering to next

363
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,960
generation fibers that we have at this

364
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,500
point so there are evolutions let's say

365
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,460
on each of the the tools or the

366
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:08,100
verticals that we have in cybersecurity

367
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:10,770
as regards solutions so these are facts

368
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,959
from today so how does security

369
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,299
cybersecurity looks today so we have

370
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,990
three point eight this is secure of

371
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:19,110
statistics

372
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,840
so three point eight events per day 3.8

373
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:26,580
million events per day per se per

374
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:30,090
company which is a lot 50 or more

375
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,039
security layers and not all of them are

376
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,600
on top of each other you might have 10

377
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:41,940
there five there another ten there so

378
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:43,559
one point eight a skill gap million 85%

379
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,710
of the breaches could have a void if you

380
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:50,428
had patching in place sixty-six percent

381
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:54,270
of the respondents say that don't have

382
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:55,710
enough employees and fifty-four percent

383
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,500
of them they don't have an incident

384
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,470
response

385
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:09,460
process in place which again is not very

386
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:14,760
good okay again cyber fax from today so

387
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:19,480
from access to detection it takes around

388
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,310
111 so 1 1 1 111 days if it's

389
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,920
opportunistic malware so mother that you

390
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:26,760
can find you know that's for everybody

391
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,270
let's say it's 73 days so it's faster

392
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:35,260
but if it is targeted one its 221 days

393
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:36,820
so slower that's a lot of days I mean

394
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,750
the attacker can do whatever they like

395
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:45,669
in those days they probably finish the

396
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:47,680
job in less fishing so intrusion access

397
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:52,140
vectors fishing being the most on the

398
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,140
first place 33rd 33%

399
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:04,450
who's paying the ransom

400
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:08,320
apparently 32% of the Vixen victims pay

401
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,540
the ransom which is huge and then we

402
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,149
have 13% the brave ones that don't pay

403
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:16,060
and they lost the data and the smart

404
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,980
ones that refused to pay but recovered

405
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,740
the data so statistically speaking not

406
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:24,250
paying the ransom pays better because

407
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:27,280
you are you might be in the 54% one but

408
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:33,880
what what is amazing is that 32% of the

409
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:35,920
victims they pay the ransom and then we

410
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,740
have so we we are at the chapter where

411
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,450
we discuss about the the technical

412
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,580
assessment so there are voices

413
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,650
mentioning that we have kind of stopped

414
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,659
evolving in cybersecurity for some years

415
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,300
now because the technologies have

416
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,760
reached maturity and there's nowhere

417
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,500
else to go so then we have to borrow

418
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,690
technology from outside and then we go

419
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,810
to artificial intelligence machine

420
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,490
learning and quantum computing and what

421
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,389
is surprising in that it works in

422
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:06,430
artificial intelligence so there is a

423
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,720
there is a study here done on the they

424
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,520
used the use cases for artificial

425
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:15,850
intelligence and amazingly cybersecurity

426
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:18,360
was in the third place so what do you

427
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:21,780
think we use artificial intelligence for

428
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,780
any ideas

429
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:36,119
yeah to work it straight not necessarily

430
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:40,259
but yeah it could be there also but

431
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:42,629
mainly to to to shorten the response

432
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:44,969
time so for detection for improving

433
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:47,069
detection and in terms of response time

434
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:49,079
so the time reduce the time so something

435
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:51,089
that people can do in I don't know hours

436
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,529
days or such they do it the artificial

437
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:57,599
the machine learning algorithms they do

438
00:21:52,529 --> 00:22:00,779
it faster and there are other voices

439
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:03,559
that say that in the near future we will

440
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:08,489
basically solve with machine learning

441
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:10,469
more than 95 95 to 98 of the issues that

442
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:12,749
we have so the incidents and alerts that

443
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:15,089
we have remaining a three percent which

444
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:18,049
will be also huge so you'll still need

445
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:18,049
people to solve it

446
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,439
ok takeaways so cyber security is

447
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,939
inevitable in my opinion so when I say

448
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:28,739
cyber security inevitable I mean

449
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:30,659
everything so incidents you cannot avoid

450
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:32,099
them investments you have to spend money

451
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:34,649
on cyber security you have to hire

452
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:37,849
people because otherwise otherwise you

453
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:40,948
can get out of business pretty fast

454
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:43,198
we had an exponential increase led by

455
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:44,909
the digital growth so we grew along with

456
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:46,679
the internet along with the digital

457
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:49,859
growth along with the digital expansion

458
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,019
so it's like we were like you know how

459
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:54,079
to call it in English but we were like a

460
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:59,729
Capuchin you know on the Internet

461
00:22:54,079 --> 00:23:01,559
yeah like a tick so so we have voices

462
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:03,269
saying not necessarily everybody

463
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,969
agreeing that we have reached technical

464
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:07,789
maturity and we have to borrow from the

465
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:11,939
outside so technology is from outside

466
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:14,039
but we still have some um bridge gaps

467
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:16,079
like the legacy protocols so we still

468
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,429
run on tcp/ip which was not improved

469
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,979
since 1982

470
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,899
too many dependencies modules and every

471
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:24,269
guy everything is more or less to

472
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:27,779
complex when you develop an application

473
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,799
today or any kind of systems and you

474
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,079
never starts from scratch

475
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,539
you always take what was done before so

476
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,489
I mean you need that I recall it's

477
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,469
putting it on the market as soon as

478
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:38,789
possible so then you need to borrow what

479
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:42,789
was done from the past and basically

480
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:45,759
this what was what what what was done

481
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:47,289
until now this is also the source the

482
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,139
major source of the issues that we have

483
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:54,339
at this point so too much complexity and

484
00:23:50,139 --> 00:24:03,158
that we are lazy enough to not to

485
00:23:54,339 --> 00:24:06,339
rewrite the code so in this we almost

486
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:08,709
have think about it almost have 50 years

487
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:10,809
of history in cybersecurity it's 48 so I

488
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:12,519
mean next year or something like that

489
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:15,059
we'll have 50 years of security of

490
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,139
history of Samba from cybersecurity

491
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:21,009
tremendous numbers so we have grown a

492
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:22,329
lot we have grown a lot a lot more more

493
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:28,659
than the other industries IT related

494
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:30,729
industries maybe as a forecast what I

495
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:33,190
can say is that I think it will become

496
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:34,779
over regulated so we already started

497
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,959
with the GDP are a nice directive now

498
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:41,440
the u.s. is trying to copy some of the

499
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:44,739
the new regulations on there on the

500
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,509
market products and services will have

501
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:48,879
to become more affordable for the masses

502
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:50,949
because cyber security I mean having

503
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:52,889
some incidents having issues is

504
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:55,149
disturbing so you need to eliminate that

505
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:56,619
it's disturbing for the business is

506
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:57,998
disturbing for your personal life is

507
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:59,349
disturbing for everybody so you need to

508
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:01,779
remove so then you have to give to the

509
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:05,739
masses tools to protect themselves and

510
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:07,239
they have to become cheaper very

511
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:10,059
unlikely that new revolutionary

512
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:11,949
technologies will be developed strictly

513
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,869
related to cybersecurity but we could

514
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:16,959
have a big impact from quantum computing

515
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:18,549
and from machine learning but this will

516
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:21,249
affect not only cybersecurity will

517
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:27,999
affect all branches so we will more or

518
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:30,519
less go along with the flow so the title

519
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:33,069
of the presentation was how come we

520
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,229
didn't now the question comes are we

521
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:36,999
going to what's your opinion are we

522
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:39,429
going to solve cyber are we going to

523
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:41,229
stop at some point or are we going to

524
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:43,679
keep going and keep going and keep going

525
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:43,679
until

526
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,600
problems

527
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:59,340
probably like this that's all I had to

528
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,340
say thank you thank you

529
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:09,240
so thank you we have time for one or two

530
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,980
questions yes let's go here can we have

531
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,440
the mic please yes please keep your

532
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:25,350
hands up so we can see them and get you

533
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:29,640
the mic oh so stand up so we can see you

534
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:32,250
in the speaker as well can you go back

535
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:38,040
please to the investment slide that

536
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:41,430
you've displayed earlier yeah show me

537
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:48,120
the investment there was there was this

538
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:50,910
decrease on 2016 versus 215 what do you

539
00:26:48,120 --> 00:27:02,129
think this happened and is there any

540
00:26:50,910 --> 00:27:03,260
chance that this will happen again yeah

541
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,580
so here

542
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,220
yeah I don't have the answer on that I

543
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,679
didn't go as much as that into details

544
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,080
so I just wanted to bring out the facts

545
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,450
and you know emphasize on certain stuff

546
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:20,340
I don't know we can search it together

547
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:23,130
Monday thank you very much okay next

548
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:28,189
question here in the front and then

549
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:30,950
we'll take a last one after that you

550
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:33,840
first and foremost thank you for your

551
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:36,660
presentation and I would like to ask

552
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:42,720
your your opinion your thoughts in

553
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:45,270
regards to the gap the skill gap that we

554
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,450
currently have in the cybersecurity if

555
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:51,840
you have any suggestions or thoughts for

556
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:54,290
someone who wants to start a career in

557
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,939
cyber security

558
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:59,190
the gap is clearly visible as I

559
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,170
mentioned so I mean Sakura Sakura rocks

560
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,910
if you search online for a job you'll

561
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,500
probably see security announcements

562
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,500
every day so we have like an ting

563
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:10,740
continuous flow of people that we need

564
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,869
so we constantly need people the gap is

565
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,049
there

566
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:16,968
I believe at this point even in Romania

567
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:21,080
so even in Romania I mean when I started

568
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:24,049
cybersecurity 2010 doing one insert

569
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,599
Romania we did not have such a big

570
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:29,109
community we did not have such big

571
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:32,779
opportunities and we did not have such

572
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:34,580
good courses I mean basically you can do

573
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,889
whatever you like on security now in

574
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,559
Romania we didn't have that in the past

575
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:41,570
I think there are a lot of opportunities

576
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:45,889
and if somebody wants to learn

577
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:47,450
cybersecurity this is the right place it

578
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:48,949
could be one of the right place it's not

579
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:53,509
the right place but one of the right

580
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:55,039
places so there is hopeless so you can

581
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:55,549
do it in Romania you can do it at this

582
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,190
point

583
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:59,929
you don't need to go outside so I think

584
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:05,570
we're done with that going outside I

585
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:11,029
mean I was outside in I'm done oh one

586
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:14,599
last question here please the white you

587
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:17,450
said something about the gap skills and

588
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:21,109
so on it's a well known that one of the

589
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:24,859
most important organ abilities it's a

590
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:27,289
well note that one of the most important

591
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:29,119
organ abilities sits between a chair and

592
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:35,989
keyboard and then this called

593
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:37,968
human factor so well known that the the

594
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:41,289
mind will inhabit or one of the most

595
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:44,419
important women ability sits between

596
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:48,580
chair and keyboard is called human

597
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:53,659
factor so do you have some figures or

598
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:55,489
strategy related awareness because one

599
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:58,999
of the most important control preventive

600
00:29:55,489 --> 00:30:01,279
control is related awareness yeah not

601
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:10,279
only and not only for the specialist and

602
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:11,839
also for users usual users in my opinion

603
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:14,059
it goes like this you can never change

604
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,190
humans I mean you can change humans but

605
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:18,499
you can change them a bit you have to

606
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:21,769
take them as they are technology has to

607
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:22,620
become how to call it there is no word

608
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:25,320
for that so

609
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:28,709
it has to become easy-to-use and secure

610
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:31,020
by default and by design so you cannot

611
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,809
blame the human for clicking a link I

612
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,730
mean you can't blame some of them but

613
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:38,039
not all of them so I mean you cannot

614
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,779
blame my mother for doing this there's

615
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:45,240
no way you can do that you can maybe

616
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:47,360
blame me but my mother no so cool thank

617
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,950
you so much then thank you thank you

618
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,949
[Applause]
