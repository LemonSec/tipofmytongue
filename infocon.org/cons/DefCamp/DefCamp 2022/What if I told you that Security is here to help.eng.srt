1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,179
all right thank you and

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,759
I think I should have used this shorter

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,080
version of the presentation that would

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,780
have made your life much much easier so

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,660
indeed my name is Sebastian avarvare uh

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,839
in ITN security for more much more than

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,160
20 years

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,340
um big fan of learning by doing big fan

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,920
of learning uh from my own mistakes and

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,900
of course I had a lot of learning

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,599
opportunities due to that

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,560
um

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,140
but turning negatives in the into

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,740
positives

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,840
security is here to help

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,579
something that sounds very

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,440
straightforward

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,079
but it's something that we are still

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,500
getting the grips with we we keep

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,539
thinking about security as being a goal

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,200
in itself

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,340
about protecting the organization that

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,680
we're part of security is about being

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,379
part of that organization

25
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,199
it's really a team sport

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,840
and there are many reasons for doing

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,820
security as a team sport

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,920
if you don't have any other take at

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,080
least this one

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,119
as a security manager

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,520
you will never

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,000
ever have enough resources

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,220
then the next big thing that you can do

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,659
is

35
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,119
find resources in other areas

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,759
work with the other team so they become

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,080
part of your extended security family

38
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,479
and any opportunities great for making

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,180
friends security incidents actually is

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,220
when I make a lot of friends

41
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,360
because

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,640
security is not a good time to do the

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,700
blaming game security is a time to make

44
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,720
friends to help others

45
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,159
and

46
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,380
in order to get to that point in order

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,020
to get to the point where yes we are

48
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,840
helping yes we are supporting the

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520
organization

50
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,640
this comes from practice this comes from

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,119
developing intentional habits and I know

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,258
that

53
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,239
we from the technical side we look at

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,540
management while we have to be born with

55
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,220
something different to to think as a

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,080
manager to be a good leader to be a good

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,020
communicator wrong

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,020
trust me managers that went through a

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,480
full MBA track and just did managerial

60
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,940
things they look the same as at the

61
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,200
technical people

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,180
they see you guys sitting in front of a

63
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,800
computer and attacking and things like

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,599
that those guys might have been born

65
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,160
that in that way no that's something

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,099
that actually you learned

67
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,060
these are intentional skills and habits

68
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,959
that we develop which brings me to

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,940
the main inspiration for the for this

70
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,840
talk

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
and

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,900
I don't know how many how many of you

73
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,519
are familiar with this book it's the The

74
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,080
Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,480
by Stephen Covey it's a book I used a

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,620
lot in uh in my work and I grew in my in

77
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,840
my management path with the principles

78
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,660
from the from this book and I find them

79
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,340
very applicable not only to leadership

80
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,000
in general but to security leadership

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,180
and there is there is a quote in the

82
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,599
book we are what we repeatedly do

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
Excellence is not an act but a habit and

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
this is where the habits come in the in

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,680
the book these are habits that we

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,200
that we have to create we have to work

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,099
on and it's also important that we have

88
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,720
to remember that we don't have to invent

89
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,260
the will I mean if you're a technical

90
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,959
guy moving into into a management track

91
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,819
or you're thinking about doing it you

92
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,560
don't have to do it by yourself there

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,080
are books like this Frameworks that you

94
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,620
can use don't reinvent the wheel

95
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,900
so let's start with the what are these

96
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,940
habits

97
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,680
the first one

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,400
be proactive this is wait for first

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,260
start

100
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,799
this is the first step you take

101
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,379
but what does it actually mean to be

102
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,920
proactive

103
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,798
typically between stimulus and reaction

104
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,720
there is no space if something happens

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,419
you react that's a reaction

106
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,960
being proactive means moving away from

107
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,880
that

108
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,520
proactive mean taking that time between

109
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,820
stimulus to think and to have an

110
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,020
intentional response

111
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,199
this is where your freedom to choose

112
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,160
actually happens

113
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,800
and it's not something that foreign to

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,380
us in security if you think about it

115
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,320
think about incident simulations

116
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,600
you do those with with your companies

117
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
you're planning ahead

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,880
you are moving away from just reacting

119
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,500
to incidents

120
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,720
to responding to this and you're even

121
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,460
taking the next step in productivity

122
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,440
you're planning how you're going to

123
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,180
respond to an incident

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,780
and another form of very useful

125
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,520
proactiveness

126
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,580
is how you deal with problems how deal

127
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,440
with with issues

128
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,380
a reaction is I see a problem

129
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,380
let's fix the problem

130
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,639
a proactive approach is we see a problem

131
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,080
how do we

132
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,360
solve the process

133
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,979
so we prevent those problems from

134
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,300
happening

135
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,000
that is the difference between

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,180
reaction and response that's that's what

137
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,180
it means to be proactive and proactive

138
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,220
also also means that

139
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,020
when something bad happens we're not

140
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,240
looking for people to blame but we're

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,220
looking on how can we help

142
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,639
and a concept that Stephen Covey

143
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,620
introduces in the book in the in the

144
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,919
chapter about proactiveness is this

145
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,500
circle not the circle of life but he's

146
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,020
talking about two circles the circle of

147
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,560
influence and the circle of concern

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,620
very simple the circle of concern is all

149
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,780
the things that we worry about all the

150
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,000
things that might have an impact on us

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,380
but we cannot do anything about them

152
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,199
the circle of influence

153
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,660
is where you can actually do something

154
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,780
it's where if you see problems this is

155
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,960
where you can actually Act

156
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,280
and

157
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,340
it matters a lot where do you put your

158
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,698
focus

159
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,180
because if you worry about the things in

160
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,080
the circle of concern

161
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,340
the you cannot change them you cannot

162
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,900
solve them and you're just going to

163
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,020
consume a lot of time and actually

164
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,900
your circle of influence what you can

165
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,039
actually do

166
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,020
is going to get smaller because you're

167
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,000
worrying about the wrong things

168
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,180
however

169
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,880
if you focus on what can you actually do

170
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,919
and do it

171
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,919
this is where you're growing your circle

172
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,960
of influence you're moving ahead in the

173
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,120
leadership you're becoming a more

174
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,699
helpful a more valuable member of your

175
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:33,660
team

176
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,740
the circle of concern is where you have

177
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,919
the the ifs the conditionals the

178
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,599
well we would have great security if

179
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,660
management would give us more money

180
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,539
the circle of influence is

181
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,160
how about I put a proposal together

182
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,319
about how can we improve our security

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,740
program

184
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,239
it's a verb we're doing something

185
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,340
and then this takes us to the next habit

186
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,319
which is

187
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,180
beginning with the end in mind

188
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,240
and kovi has a nice quote in the book

189
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,139
again

190
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,780
all things are created twice there's a

191
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,419
mental first creation

192
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,340
and then there's the second physical

193
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,860
creation

194
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,020
and I want you to do a quick exercise

195
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,399
think about it

196
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,500
three years from now you're leaving the

197
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,179
job you're in

198
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,880
you have your farewell parties and your

199
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,919
colleagues and your managers come to the

200
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,260
party and they they hold the speeches

201
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,100
and they say what a great person you are

202
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,140
how much you help the company and they

203
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,060
give examples of what did you actually

204
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,959
do

205
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,720
where was that greatness coming from

206
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,600
what were the three or five or seven

207
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,380
things that you will be remembered for

208
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,380
what would you like those things to be

209
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,720
those should be your goals

210
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,519
this is what you should work for

211
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,480
begin with the end in mind Define where

212
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
you want to get and by the way that

213
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
exercise is something that you can do

214
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,940
from time to time see how are you on

215
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,080
your path

216
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,760
have the goals changed maybe you find

217
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,640
maybe news but you think about you

218
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,600
define the outcomes before you take any

219
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,519
action

220
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,380
you even do things and I know it sounds

221
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,240
boring you do things like mission

222
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,120
statements like defining Visions making

223
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,279
plans making strategies

224
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,980
because this is what leadership is about

225
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,279
this is actually the a higher form of

226
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,100
practice I'm thinking about how the

227
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,500
company how the team how am I going to

228
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,360
look in three or five years

229
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,000
and

230
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,040
this is where we start moving from

231
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,060
managing emergencies and and actually

232
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,160
leading according to a plan and you'll

233
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,140
see later there is actually a difference

234
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,399
between

235
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,399
lead being a leader and being a manager

236
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,060
and it sounds

237
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,740
it sounds radical

238
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,360
yeah it's just another of those

239
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,339
management talks no I've actually used

240
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:27,420
it

241
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,880
man I dare say quite successfully

242
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,339
Let Me Show an example and this is a

243
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,560
real case I've used this method it

244
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,800
doesn't matter the details and the uh

245
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,380
and I try to blur the the parts that

246
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,760
might to refer to the company but it's

247
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,160
nothing really confidential

248
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,459
but it started with I was in charge of

249
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,079
application security

250
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,440
and I wanted to make it a bit more

251
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,760
predictable

252
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,579
I wanted to be clearer about what do we

253
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,040
want to achieve so I started by creating

254
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,560
a application security Vision which is

255
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,779
basically a mission statement

256
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,240
what do we want to be in terms of

257
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,760
application security so

258
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,860
came up with this phrase security is a

259
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,320
building quality of our applications of

260
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,480
measurable maturity and so on and so

261
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,019
forth so this is our mission statement

262
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,760
this is what we're

263
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,399
driving towards

264
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,860
and then I started working backwards

265
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,540
from that

266
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,959
let's define what are for this year

267
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,720
based on that Vision what are the three

268
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,480
main goals we want to hit

269
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,940
and then take it further take those

270
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,100
three goals and start breaking it down

271
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,980
into even more specific initiatives that

272
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,680
we want to drive but all part of the

273
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,019
same vision

274
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,920
and then take it one step further and lo

275
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
and behold

276
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,600
I have the plan for the year

277
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,720
it's as simple as that and this is some

278
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
this is something that is proactive this

279
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,160
is something that takes leadership and

280
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,320
you don't even have to be a manager to

281
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,480
do things like that this is something

282
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,720
that as a security professional you can

283
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,579
work with and you can start proposing

284
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,440
and you can use things like that by the

285
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,779
way referring to to the previous to the

286
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,019
previous uh Habit you can draw your

287
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,140
circle of influence and you'll see a lot

288
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,240
in in this presentation how these habits

289
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,519
are supporting each other how they work

290
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,339
together and you keep growing with them

291
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,779
but of course when we look ahead

292
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,519
we also have to pay attention at the

293
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
step in front of us it's like when

294
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,680
running I do long distance running

295
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm looking at how many more kilometers

296
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,279
I have what's the next city I want to

297
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,440
get to but I also need to pay a bit

298
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,180
attention what and what I'm stepping

299
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,899
into

300
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,000
and

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,639
I know that with many companies it feels

302
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,700
today that you have 10 000 things coming

303
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,279
at you at once

304
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,079
I presume it's pretty much the same with

305
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,120
any company and by the way if it's not

306
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,860
the same in your company let me know if

307
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,560
you have any vacancies

308
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,579
but

309
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,120
this is how it feels

310
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,620
and there's a saying management

311
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,920
is doing things right

312
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,540
leadership

313
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,639
is doing the right things

314
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,860
but how do we know what are the right

315
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,160
things

316
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,899
and in the book

317
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,920
Stephen Covey gives this example of you

318
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,660
know you're part of a company that

319
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,399
marches through the through the jungle

320
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,760
and the the manager makes sure that the

321
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,339
machetes are sharp that that they can

322
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,380
cut nicely and everybody's in deep shape

323
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,839
they rotate the people in front who keep

324
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,000
cutting and they're making good progress

325
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,740
that's management you're making sure

326
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,060
that your team

327
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,160
cuts through the jungle

328
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,500
but then there's this guy

329
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,019
who climbs to a tall tree

330
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,440
looks around

331
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,200
guys we are in the wrong jungle

332
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,639
that's the difference between leadership

333
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,740
and management

334
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,480
management is about hacking Through the

335
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,240
Jungle leadership

336
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,360
is knowing if you're in the right jungle

337
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,980
and if you're going into the right

338
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,200
direction

339
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,620
and by there there is there there is

340
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,180
actually a thing called withdrawal

341
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,040
syndrome for people who are moving from

342
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,860
managing to Leading because managing is

343
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,320
very is very rewarding it's very

344
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,300
addictive you're solving problems you

345
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,579
get that that nice good feeling that you

346
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,459
you saw the the problem in front of you

347
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,079
but

348
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,660
when you keep focusing on that you might

349
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,720
lose track of the the plan you might

350
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,760
forget what is your mission statement

351
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,079
where do you want to to be and

352
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,839
another tool that uh coffee gives in the

353
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,980
book

354
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,620
it's called the time Matrix

355
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,339
and trust me I cannot do justice to the

356
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,320
book of how many Concepts and tools you

357
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,480
have in there at least I mean if you

358
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,740
want to be here for for the next three

359
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,079
days as the presenter was saying earlier

360
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,440
just just give me the word but this is a

361
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,579
very useful one it's about

362
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,660
prioritizing but how do we prioritize

363
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,880
and he makes this simple table where you

364
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,399
have the uh on the columns the things

365
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,339
which are Urgent not urgent in the row

366
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,720
you have the things that are important

367
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,760
not important

368
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,880
and of course in the first quadrant it's

369
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,339
urgent and important those are the

370
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,380
crisis the the emergency meetings they

371
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,540
have the last minute deadlines those are

372
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,880
things which are necessary

373
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,440
and then you have the second quadrant

374
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,560
which thinks that are important but not

375
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,120
really urgent

376
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,959
then you have the distractions and the

377
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,360
time wasters things that you really

378
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,100
shouldn't be worrying that much about

379
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,920
but where do you think as a leader that

380
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
you should be putting your time and your

381
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,740
effort

382
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,940
a manager would say

383
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,440
q1

384
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,720
but a leader

385
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,480
would focus here

386
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,579
because this is where you're adding

387
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,279
value as a leader you're thinking

388
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,079
proactively you're making plans you're

389
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,060
making sure that you are going through

390
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,579
the through the right jungle you're

391
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,560
making sure that the latter that the

392
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,480
manager is climbing is actually leaning

393
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,380
against the right wall

394
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,920
that quadrant is where a leader should

395
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,160
be putting most of his time and get rid

396
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,560
as much as possible of all the

397
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,899
distractions and time wasters and for

398
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,320
the Q ones yes they need to be addressed

399
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,559
time box them or find somebody that you

400
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,839
to whom you can delete excuse me you can

401
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,740
delegate those

402
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,380
that's how you get to effectiveness

403
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,339
but

404
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,919
speaking of managing time you have to be

405
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,179
aware

406
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,119
not just of your time but also the time

407
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,480
of others let's take a simple example

408
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,460
so you're a great leader you keep coming

409
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,679
with plans and ideas and you have an

410
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,179
idea

411
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,120
and because you have a team the team

412
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,160
starts working

413
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,080
and then

414
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,600
you have another idea

415
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,340
and the team for whom you are in

416
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,020
Inspiration starts working on that as

417
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,140
well and then you get another idea

418
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,039
and you keep going

419
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,960
because you have a lot of ideas but what

420
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,940
do you think happens

421
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,820
with your team

422
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,100
you have to be mindful of what is

423
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,660
possible

424
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,880
and this applies not only to your teams

425
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,179
but this applies just as well to working

426
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,100
with the others

427
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,380
because you're leading a security team

428
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,240
you keep telling other people in the

429
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,620
company you have to do this you have to

430
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,740
do this you have can they actually do it

431
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,679
do they have the resources to fulfill

432
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,660
all those requirements yes which are

433
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,039
security requirements and they are

434
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,380
absolutely paramountally important but

435
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,120
can they actually do it

436
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,820
and it's also about about being mindful

437
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,280
of not starting too many things that you

438
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,700
can't finish because

439
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,580
it's very toxic for the morale of your

440
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,419
team to start 50 projects

441
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,160
and not taking any any of them to

442
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,320
completion you better focus on two

443
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,559
projects and get them done because that

444
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,660
gives to the team a sense of accomplish

445
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,179
accomplishment having

446
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,419
50 projects going slowly slowly slowly

447
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,580
and every every quarterly meeting you

448
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,919
come to with the same status yeah it's

449
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,299
about the same yeah it's still in

450
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,539
progress that's not going to to make

451
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,039
management very happy but more

452
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,799
importantly it's not going to make your

453
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,679
team people very happy

454
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,500
and it's also about finding problems

455
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,760
saying we work in security we leave for

456
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,220
finding problems finding vulnerabilities

457
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,840
finding

458
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,179
can you actually fix them

459
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,820
are you in the position to say we need

460
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,440
to fix them all

461
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,059
if you're not and if you're at the

462
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,980
beginning of your career

463
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,360
probably you're not

464
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,799
then you shouldn't be worried about them

465
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:46,740
remember the circle of influence and the

466
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,559
circle of concern finding ten thousand

467
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,320
problems that you cannot fix

468
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,539
is pointless

469
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,000
finding two problems that you can fix

470
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,360
it's Priceless and this is what's going

471
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,240
to increase your circle of of influence

472
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,520
and this is how you eventually get to

473
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,679
the point where you can say yes I found

474
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,020
those 10 000 problems their management

475
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,360
this is the budget that I need to fix

476
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,419
those problems but be mindful are you at

477
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,980
that point or not

478
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,400
think only about the problems you can

479
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,720
actually solve

480
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,620
and then we move to the next habit

481
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,900
the win-win habit and by the way this is

482
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,580
where we make the transition from the

483
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,559
first three habits which kovi describes

484
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,660
as being the personal victories the

485
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,820
personal improvements to the public

486
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,380
victories

487
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,299
and

488
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,620
think win win

489
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,020
and this is about creating win-win

490
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,059
agreements and making sure that

491
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,140
everybody has a good place and win-win

492
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,640
is not about compromise

493
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,840
there are there are things that coffee

494
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,000
calls the paradigms of human interaction

495
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,039
and there are different types of

496
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,380
paradigms you have the the win-lose

497
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,020
Paradigm where I need I need to in order

498
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,820
for me to win the other guy needs to

499
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,919
lose there is the lose win Paradigm

500
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,500
where yeah in order to make that person

501
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,720
happy or that team happy I'm going to

502
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
lose so they so they can win but the one

503
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,039
that we want to drive towards is of

504
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,039
course the the win-win and this these

505
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,919
paradigms of win lose they are driven by

506
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,840
two things it's the balance between

507
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,539
courage and consideration

508
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,940
courage to stand up for what you believe

509
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,700
courage to say I want to make this

510
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,320
change

511
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,380
and consideration which is being

512
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,539
considered what does the other party

513
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,380
need what do they what do they want

514
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,940
and

515
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,039
kovi also talks about

516
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,320
the abundance mindset and this is

517
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,840
something very important for getting to

518
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,600
that win-win situation because the

519
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,320
abundance mindset is the shift from well

520
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,600
we don't have enough things so yeah I'm

521
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,419
going to protect mine I want to I want

522
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,280
to win myself and that will mean that

523
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,539
there's going to be less for the other

524
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,640
to no actually we have enough things to

525
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,340
do what we need it's yeah focusing on

526
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,620
the positive and I it sounds so so

527
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,980
cliche focus on what you have but it's

528
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,299
important because focus on what you have

529
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:29,220
is you working in the circle of

530
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,679
influence focusing on what you don't

531
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,580
have

532
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,280
is focusing on the circle of concern and

533
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,720
we want to focus on the circle of

534
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,760
influence and that's why we need that

535
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,740
abundance mindset we need to think about

536
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,559
what we have what can we actually

537
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,059
work with and

538
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,280
I'm going to give here an example where

539
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,240
I actually used that because I want to

540
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,679
make it clear that these are very

541
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,419
practical skills these are very

542
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,120
practical habits many years ago as I was

543
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,100
working with a colleague who is a

544
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,200
brilliant security architect

545
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,880
unfortunately

546
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,740
customer after customer that he was

547
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,760
working with

548
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,280
they were saying we are so happy for

549
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,740
what he did we never want to work with

550
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,720
him again because he's so difficult and

551
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,059
he was about to be to be fired and I

552
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,980
said to my manager at the time because I

553
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,320
was just starting working on this kind

554
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,600
of things and reading the management

555
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,919
books and

556
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,780
can I work with him on coaching and I

557
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,460
took the initiative and I worked with

558
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,960
with him to

559
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,940
to understand what does what is the

560
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,760
problem and helping him to see where the

561
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,559
issues are and

562
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,559
we actually manage in about you know two

563
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,080
three months to get to a point where he

564
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,360
understood now why was he having those

565
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,000
conflicts and it was a win for him

566
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,460
because he kept doing what he wanted to

567
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,620
do and it was a win for the company

568
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,520
because they got to keep a very valuable

569
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,480
member of the team

570
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,980
and

571
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,080
this is also a good point to remember

572
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,460
again there's a difference between

573
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,159
reacting and responding in win-win

574
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,580
scenarios we we take the time instead of

575
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,679
reacting to problems we're thinking

576
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,780
we're making a response that drives us

577
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,500
to having a win-win and

578
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,179
what exactly is winning

579
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,440
it's easy to say yeah we want a win-win

580
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,840
situation but in order to be able to get

581
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,159
that win-win situation is defining what

582
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,740
winning means and

583
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,740
here I just made a very simple example

584
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,840
let's say you are in the security team

585
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,640
and you're working with the development

586
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,500
team each of you will have slightly

587
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,000
different goals you want you want the

588
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,880
application to to be as safe as possible

589
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,320
you want to have the logs that you can

590
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,840
feed into your your seam and or analyze

591
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,940
during incidents you you want the secure

592
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,340
the security requirements to be taken

593
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,799
seriously by the by the team and you

594
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,020
want to stop getting those requests oh

595
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,520
we need we need this deployed in

596
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,960
production by tomorrow can we can you

597
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,580
approve it please

598
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,320
the development team

599
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,480
will have different definitions of

600
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,840
winning and you have to to take the time

601
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,020
to actually understand what is their

602
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,059
definition of winning

603
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:23,039
and only once you have those two then

604
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,500
you can come up with an agreement that

605
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,740
incorporates and addresses all or at

606
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,919
least most of

607
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,260
of the winning criteria for each party

608
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,799
which by the way is a very good segue to

609
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,779
the next habit

610
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,900
seek first to understand

611
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,760
and then to be understood

612
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,600
and maybe for us in security is one of

613
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,360
the most important habits

614
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,840
because we are so focused on what we are

615
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,220
doing

616
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,320
we are so focused on security is

617
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,940
important security is important but

618
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,559
remember security is about helping

619
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,140
security is about understanding what

620
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,260
exactly are you defending

621
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,260
and to be able to understand the other

622
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,240
party is

623
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,360
you have to get yourself out of the way

624
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,980
understanding doesn't mean just

625
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,740
understanding the other party from your

626
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,960
frame of reference understanding is

627
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,960
understanding the other party from their

628
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,039
own frame of reference and I said think

629
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,059
about

630
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,400
what it means for them what is the

631
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,740
organization concerned about

632
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,020
what are the issues that threaten the

633
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,400
business not the

634
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,740
technical security threat but what are

635
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,380
the the issues that the uh that the

636
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,419
businesses worry about and

637
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,340
again in the book you have a lot of

638
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,320
techniques about for example

639
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,539
using what's called empathically

640
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,020
listening instead of autobiography

641
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,460
autobiography listening sorry still

642
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,080
struggling with that word

643
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,980
um

644
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,919
the difference between the two the

645
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,559
autobiographical listening is when you

646
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,720
inter interpret what you're hearing from

647
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,640
the other party through your own

648
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,559
experiences you're putting your own

649
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,200
filters your your your perceptions your

650
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,340
biases

651
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,380
everything that comes from the other

652
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,260
party is filtered through that

653
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,600
empathical listening is you're actually

654
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,480
understanding their point of view their

655
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,580
rep their reference point

656
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,580
and this is how you achieve really

657
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,400
understanding of the other party

658
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,860
and

659
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,159
it's really listening with the intent of

660
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,779
understanding because

661
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,520
that's something that we also do very

662
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,799
frequently we we listen just to look for

663
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,400
arguments to to counter we leave we

664
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,860
listen because we want to see how can we

665
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,020
dismantle their argument but that's not

666
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,000
really listening that's just looking for

667
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,299
a fight

668
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,760
and after you've done that after you

669
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,380
you're sure that you understood the

670
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,159
other party then you can look to explain

671
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,440
yourself to explain your reference to

672
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,240
make sure that the other party can do

673
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,520
the same and you help them in getting an

674
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,600
understanding of where you're coming

675
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,220
from and

676
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,080
there are many tools to do that some of

677
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,820
them are in the book and yeah we don't

678
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,220
have to reinvent the wheel this is again

679
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,140
some something that happens to a lot of

680
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,760
people moving from technical fields to

681
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,779
management we're looking to recreate the

682
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,460
wheel now there are so many Frameworks

683
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,559
I'm just giving here two examples of how

684
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,600
to deal with leadership and how to hire

685
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,700
people there are so many tools and

686
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,940
Frameworks that can make our life much

687
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,480
easier

688
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,539
and then we have the Habit number six

689
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:49,919
which is

690
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,659
synergize

691
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,659
and and I used here the the example of

692
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,480
from The Avengers movie if you know it

693
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,460
at some point Nick Fury describes the

694
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,679
The Avengers initiatives that the idea

695
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,600
was to bring together a group of

696
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,419
remarkable people see if they could be

697
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,200
see if they could become something more

698
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,400
and that's actually

699
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,980
exactly what kovi means in the in the

700
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,960
book Synergy is not the same as

701
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,059
compromise

702
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:23,700
in a compromise one plus one equals one

703
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,159
and a half at best

704
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,640
it's Synergy is transitioning from let's

705
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,820
compromise to let's come up with

706
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,399
something better than what the two of us

707
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,220
had in mind and let's do a simple

708
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,480
exercise

709
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,580
look at the picture

710
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,880
think about which animal do you see

711
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,020
keep that keep that in mind

712
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,980
now tell me how many of you

713
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,419
have seen a duck

714
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:58,860
right

715
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:04,020
how many of you have seen a rabbit

716
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,960
see now I have the two positions the two

717
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,760
different views

718
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,380
and I'm wrong

719
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,620
because those are not the only outcomes

720
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,240
how many people

721
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,120
were able to see both animals at wheel

722
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,140
that's a third way

723
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,659
and this is about

724
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:26,640
understanding the differences

725
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,440
this is this is where it starts and

726
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,260
Synergy is a very strong combination of

727
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,720
the previous habits

728
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,120
it's understanding those differences and

729
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,460
valuing them

730
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,340
some things some things are coming much

731
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,200
easier to certain type of people how do

732
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,899
we use those differences in what in what

733
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,039
we do

734
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,700
and again sounds very theoretical I've

735
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,460
used it many years ago I I became the

736
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,559
the global lead for the application

737
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,140
security domain in a large Company the

738
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,419
company was coming from a point where

739
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,240
every year the central management was

740
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,520
coming with a set of targets and all the

741
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,740
teams worldwide would have to meet those

742
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,020
targets and everybody didn't like them

743
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,620
and they were endless frustrations and

744
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,960
complaints and conflicts in the in the

745
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,000
team

746
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,399
and then I tried something else

747
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,000
how about we work together on defining

748
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,559
those objectives and I know it sounds

749
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,380
obvious all the great things are obvious

750
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,779
in hindsight so I work with with them

751
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:32,940
and we come up with a set of objectives

752
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,940
for that year which were much more

753
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,080
ambitious

754
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,360
much better than what was coming from

755
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,340
the top and you know what they were

756
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,440
actually achieved and exceeded because

757
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,500
they were the result of working together

758
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,320
and there was first they were the result

759
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,960
of seeking to understand we understood

760
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,220
each other

761
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,080
what are your challenges what are my

762
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,000
wishes where do we come from

763
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,500
also

764
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,659
it was part of beginning with the end of

765
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,299
mind but

766
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:06,299
clarifying what that end is because when

767
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,799
you start to synergize between different

768
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,860
teams maybe the end

769
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,779
it's not the same one that you had in

770
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,700
mind but it's a better one

771
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,260
it's

772
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,440
that situation where one plus one starts

773
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,740
to to equal three or ten or a hundred

774
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,779
because you brought

775
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:28,020
some good things together and the result

776
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,440
was actually more than the sum of its

777
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,299
parts

778
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,580
however

779
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,500
it works in reverse

780
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,260
the the negatives can also synergize

781
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,460
I mean

782
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,860
to start with a simple example you have

783
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,620
many systems in your network and one

784
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,179
system has a small vulnerability the

785
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,399
other system has another one and you

786
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,080
know the scenario multiple small

787
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,179
vulnerabilities can combine to make a

788
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,059
very exploitable situation

789
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,640
same with leadership

790
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,559
you can you might

791
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,600
inconvenience a little bit the marketing

792
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,460
team you might make a little bit of

793
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,779
enemy with

794
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,860
um with the sales team you might be a

795
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,860
little bit not liked by the development

796
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,940
team but when all those small

797
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,460
very small unpleasantness combined then

798
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,140
you have actually illustration where the

799
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,880
entire company is against you so you

800
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,039
have to work to build the synergies with

801
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,080
each of those teams you have to build

802
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,120
towards a positive outcome

803
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,440
and finally we have the seventh habit

804
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,140
which is a bit of

805
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,440
all comp all accomplishing uh Habit

806
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,600
which is about how do we bring it all

807
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,240
together and how do we keep improving

808
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,440
ourselves

809
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,600
and the name of the of the Habit comes

810
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,360
from uh from a story that uh coffee

811
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,000
gives in the book so you come you are

812
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,620
walking into the woods you come across

813
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,600
somebody who is cutting a tree and that

814
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,519
person is hard at work and you ask them

815
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,219
so how long have you been at it of I'm

816
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,020
cutting these three four four six hours

817
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,359
and I'm so tired and there's still so

818
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,980
much to do and

819
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,219
to how about you sharpen the soul

820
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,320
take a break sharpen the sew in that

821
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,080
might make things go faster no no I

822
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,839
don't have time for that

823
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,199
and it's related to a story that a true

824
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,599
story that coffee tells about his father

825
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,719
he was complaining to to his father that

826
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,300
oh I'm so tired I don't have any time to

827
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,060
work on myself every everything is

828
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,960
urgent I

829
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,899
and his father asked him

830
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,199
are you ever so busy driving

831
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,118
that you don't have time to stop for gas

832
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,159
how does that end

833
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,339
because that's exactly why we have in

834
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,500
our security industry such a big problem

835
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,940
with burnout

836
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,760
because we never stop for gas we never

837
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,820
stop to work on ourselves we don't take

838
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,320
time

839
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,680
to sharpen the soul and yeah I know it

840
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,079
sounds again very theoretical and very

841
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,480
new agent

842
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,079
but there are four dimensions of of the

843
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,540
of renewal that this is how Kobe calls

844
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,760
them and it's about the principle of

845
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,760
working on your body work on working on

846
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,280
your heart working on your mind and

847
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,119
working on your spirit and

848
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:34,460
working on your body is quite obvious

849
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,920
exercising be careful what you eat be

850
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,960
careful how much we drink

851
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,160
um

852
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,440
and for me for example

853
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,500
I started a few years ago to run and

854
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,320
running is my me time running is

855
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,940
actually when I thought and I started to

856
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,940
develop this presentation

857
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,599
it it was created in my mind long before

858
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,960
I put anything in a slide

859
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,660
because I was taking that time

860
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,700
I was running for an hour or two and

861
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,339
yeah I had that was my thinking time and

862
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:09,720
it's different for everybody you have to

863
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,300
find your own same with with spirit I

864
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,119
mean yes coffee was a very religious guy

865
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,700
and you can see that in the book I'm a

866
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,619
he's an atheist

867
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,619
but I still resonated with the book and

868
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,320
what spirituality means for me is very

869
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,000
different from what spirituality means

870
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,420
for kovi and each of you will have a

871
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,280
different definition and that's fine you

872
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,339
need to find what is your

873
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,500
definition of spirituality what what

874
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,680
things Enlighten your spirituality and

875
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,540
things like volunteering I mean think

876
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,220
about the all the volunteers that are

877
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,960
running this conference and helping

878
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,640
they're not doing it for a material

879
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,440
purpose they're here to do something

880
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,680
more find your own definition but keep

881
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,960
working on them because

882
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,300
if we if we don't if we don't take that

883
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,280
time to sharpen the soul you know

884
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,579
there's there's a big burnout sign at

885
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,220
the at the end of our not very distant

886
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,780
future and

887
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,839
if we only focus on the immediate on

888
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,700
urgent and we don't take time to improve

889
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,619
to work on those habits

890
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,780
we're not really going to progress that

891
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,960
far

892
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,560
and you see the you see the uh the

893
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,380
acronym there EBAs and probably some of

894
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,640
you was wondering what the hell is an

895
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,700
EPA it's another nice term that kovi

896
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,400
came with it's it's called emotional

897
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,380
bank account

898
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,300
and every time you have a successful

899
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,339
relation with somebody else you're

900
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,700
making a deposit in that emotional bank

901
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,560
account and works in your family in your

902
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,880
circle of friends

903
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,800
and in your companies

904
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,380
every time you work on having a

905
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,480
successful win-win situation with

906
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,339
another with another department with

907
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,079
another colleague you're making an

908
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,760
emotional

909
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,700
bank account deposit and you can rely on

910
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,520
that deposit when you need it

911
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,460
so keep working on yourself because it's

912
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,540
very important

913
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,400
so hopefully in time

914
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,339
these are again the seven habits

915
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,900
be proactive

916
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,060
begin with the end in mind

917
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,160
put first things first

918
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,020
think win win

919
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,700
seek first to understand then to be

920
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,780
understood

921
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,339
synergize

922
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,859
sharpen the soul and then do it all over

923
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,359
again

924
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,640
because

925
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,040
the benefits that you get from working

926
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,640
on all those habits are much bigger than

927
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,799
the sum of all the benefits individually

928
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,720
so I'm Sebastian Affair and again

929
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,640
security is here to help

930
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,098
thank you very much Sebastian

931
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,940
and you was right in time any questions

932
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,079
yes I can see couple of them

933
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,200
hey thank you for the presentation uh I

934
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,300
would like to ask for your opinion which

935
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,640
of the seven habits do you consider to

936
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,460
be like the most effective or let's say

937
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,060
if Done Right could have or deliver the

938
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,339
most impact in the company for

939
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,140
insecurity

940
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,940
the one that you can start working on

941
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,160
tomorrow

942
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,960
okay pick one

943
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,060
it's again it's important to work on all

944
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,960
of them

945
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,000
but in the spirit of the first one the

946
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,500
proactiveness you have to start

947
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,780
somewhere and I can make Arguments for

948
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,180
each of them why are they important for

949
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,700
you or for a security leader in general

950
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,400
but talking theoretically about habits

951
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,579
is not creating a habit

952
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,920
habit is something that we intentionally

953
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,420
develop something that we put in

954
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,680
practice

955
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,200
so pick one pick one see the one that

956
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,880
resonates I recommend starting with

957
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,339
proactiveness but that's just me

958
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:04,320
pick the one that resonates with you

959
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,180
that you think you can actually start

960
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,240
working on and go from there

961
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,560
thank you

962
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,260
a question here you told that you you

963
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,720
told us about empiric talking with other

964
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,140
people from our teams but in this

965
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,839
empathy implies some vulnerability and

966
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,400
we are taught in the cyber security

967
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,099
industry industry that the vulnerability

968
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:28,619
in the system is not good how do you

969
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,240
manage to develop this kind of

970
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,439
vulnerability in a team

971
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:37,320
can you run it by me again

972
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,460
how do you manage to develop uh to to

973
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,440
let other people be vulnerable in a

974
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,000
cyber security team when the

975
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,599
vulnerability notion is not that good

976
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,800
so how do I how do I grow a team yeah

977
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,660
by getting first of all

978
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,240
by making sure that what I hire in the

979
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,820
team are people that that I can work

980
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,280
with so that's why you have a lot of

981
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,020
Frameworks in in hiring that help you to

982
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,300
identify are are the candidates the

983
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,160
right ones for the

984
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,560
not in general but for the type of

985
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,180
position that you have open

986
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,339
are they suitable and not from a

987
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,680
technical point of view but from a

988
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,079
mindset point of view and then you have

989
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,480
Frameworks like Kate Blanchard's

990
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,060
situations leadership where you get used

991
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,220
to and you learn how to work with people

992
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,619
that are on different stages of of their

993
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,020
career people who need very directive

994
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,060
you have to tell them step by step what

995
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,920
they need to do and people who are your

996
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,500
basically your right hand and you have

997
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,960
to work on understanding so it starts

998
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,599
with if you remember with seeking first

999
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,240
to understand you are looking what are

1000
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,220
their strengths what are the Improvement

1001
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,880
points and you work with them on those

1002
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,800
areas and where they have strength you

1003
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,140
get out of the way but you have to have

1004
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,880
that understanding of your team you need

1005
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,780
to know where there are the

1006
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,820
vulnerabilities and the strong points

1007
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,500
Does this answer the question or yeah

1008
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,900
okay thanks thank you

1009
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,640
there is one question in the back Andre

1010
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,780
and by the way afterwards just before

1011
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,579
the red red vest in the networking area

1012
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,800
you can find me there I've got the more

1013
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,140
uh here can I yes please yeah please

1014
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,520
so I've got a more theoretical question

1015
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,859
uh what if you got a problem for the

1016
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:27,839
circle of concern that is that big that

1017
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,000
could crush the circle of Interest the

1018
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,220
circle of influence sorry

1019
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,980
I didn't quite hear it so we've got the

1020
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,500
problem uh in the circle of concern that

1021
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,119
it's that big that could crush the

1022
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,500
circle of

1023
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,220
influence

1024
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,380
so

1025
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,140
the circle of concern is where we can

1026
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,700
make a difference and you need to be

1027
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,619
able to identify that first of course

1028
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,839
you need to know what what is your

1029
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,820
circle of influence that

1030
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,520
that's the first step but then by

1031
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,200
putting the actions there

1032
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,140
if that was was your question

1033
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,420
those improvements that you make

1034
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,280
are going to be noticed

1035
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,099
and the sphere of things that you can

1036
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:13,260
influence will keep growing

1037
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,339
it

1038
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:16,500
I don't know if that answers your

1039
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,839
question I was asking that we've got a

1040
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,119
problem that we couldn't solve but it

1041
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,339
will affect us that we it it will reduce

1042
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:26,760
the circle of influence that we have

1043
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,800
like the things we can do it will affect

1044
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,780
the things we can do we will do we could

1045
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,660
yeah oh so a problem that you cannot

1046
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,900
solve okay it's

1047
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,339
at least you tried but the pro sometimes

1048
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,740
just the process of trying to solve it

1049
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,500
and reaching that

1050
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,079
understanding that okay now we know why

1051
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,000
the problem cannot be solved it's still

1052
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,680
something that will improve your circle

1053
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,579
of of influence because the process that

1054
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:56,160
you went through we tried we identified

1055
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,200
instead of making an assumption at the

1056
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,940
beginning that this cannot be done

1057
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,460
which is a circle of in a circle of

1058
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,040
concern kind of thinking you took the

1059
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,079
steps you tried and at least you gain

1060
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,880
some knowledge that you can then apply

1061
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,500
okay we'll redefine the problem we'll

1062
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,540
try in a different way but it's still in

1063
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,819
the sphere of what we can influence you

1064
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,800
can make a plan you can make a proposal

1065
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,660
right next time let's approach the

1066
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,339
problem in different way let's redefine

1067
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:21,720
the problem that we're trying to solve

1068
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,560
thank you

1069
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,980
okay may I have the last one the last

1070
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,800
question may I address it to you

1071
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,780
there is there is another one here sorry

1072
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,760
hi thank you very much for the

1073
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,720
presentation uh out of the seven habits

1074
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,319
which one should the new hire have most

1075
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:45,359
the ones that you need for the role that

1076
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,520
they need to fulfill there's there's no

1077
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,099
single one I mean if you're hiring

1078
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:52,740
somebody on a junior role

1079
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,599
yeah you're looking for somebody who has

1080
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,119
a you know a good initiative but some

1081
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,000
somebody who is willing to understand

1082
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
more and listen first before starting to

1083
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,460
make to make changes if you're hiring

1084
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,140
for a management for a senior position

1085
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,140
you want somebody who is a bit more

1086
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,839
outgoing somebody who knows how to to

1087
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,880
begin with the end in mind how to make a

1088
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,079
plan

1089
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,099
but again if you start with what are

1090
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:23,040
what is the the candidate you're that's

1091
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,540
the second part of the equation the

1092
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,720
first question you need to ask is for

1093
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,300
this role and I need to Define very

1094
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,480
specific what this role is about what

1095
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,339
are the things that are important

1096
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,859
and again not something you need to do

1097
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,079
by yourself talk with if you're in a

1098
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,520
company talk with your HR department

1099
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,160
they would have tools to help you how do

1100
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,020
you draft a job description how you

1101
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,740
describe and identify the qualities not

1102
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,660
just technical ones that are needed for

1103
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,960
somebody to be successful in that role

1104
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,339
thank you

1105
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:59,400
may I have the last one Sebastian oh

1106
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,220
please which are your three things for

1107
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,359
which you'd like to be remembered of

1108
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:08,540
ah

1109
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,339
it is she needs to get a few more hats

1110
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:12,720
for but that's that's a very good

1111
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,339
question and by the way when some when

1112
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,380
somebody tells this is a very good

1113
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,579
question

1114
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,560
they are buying time because they have

1115
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,579
no idea what the answer should be

1116
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,140
one or two or

1117
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,960
now I'm so I would like to be remembered

1118
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,920
for

1119
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,859
really synergizing the business and the

1120
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:33,359
technical mindset

1121
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,760
I would like to be reminded for

1122
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,040
inspiring people

1123
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,480
and I'd like to be reminded for getting

1124
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,980
things done

1125
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,040
excellent the first the second one I

1126
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,099
guess you did it for today and uh thank

1127
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:50,420
you very much for the presentation
