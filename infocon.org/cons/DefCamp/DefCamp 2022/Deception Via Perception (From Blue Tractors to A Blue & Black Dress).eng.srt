1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,060
it's my uh my legal disclaimer I'm not a

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,380
lawyer but I played one on the internet

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,560
before successfully uh so this is uh

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,300
this is always for you to remember when

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,800
I'm going through my talk and I see

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,120
something you see something really bad

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,740
or I say something really horrible and

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,179
or or do something really horrible

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,580
you're like Jason that's atrocious why

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,320
would you do that remember the kittens

11
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,960
I'm adorable okay I'm not going to try

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,820
to steal from you kill you or ruin you

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,080
financially unless you pay me first

14
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,019
there's always a contract so when we get

15
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,400
to those points just remember the

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,960
kittens

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
um and I also want to apologize because

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,860
you know I'm American and so that means

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,360
I only speak one language and I'm from

20
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,820
Texas I don't speak it very well but I

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,100
make up for it I speak it very loud and

22
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,860
Fast so uh and that's good because I'm

23
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,739
already going to run late so sorry not

24
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,559
sorry uh this is a talk perceptions from

25
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,480
a blue tractor to a blue and black dress

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,700
me have any other kind of subtle

27
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,039
messages no I wouldn't do that it's like

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,559
but um I would like to say the reason

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,719
why I'm using this because I was so so

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
inspired by seeing because this is what

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,920
it's all about my talk it's about human

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,640
perception how we perceive one thing but

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,439
then if you put it into another context

34
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,439
it's like oh that could be dangerous for

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,939
someone because you look at look at

36
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,159
these adorable little blue tractors you

37
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,840
know it's like that looks like they

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,580
should be on Thomas the Tank Engine with

39
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,439
like little smiley faces on them and

40
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,299
stuff you know they look adorable who

41
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,920
knew they were such great anti-tank

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,619
weapons it's like I mean it was just it

43
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,540
was just in a different context you know

44
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,400
it's like oh this looks all adorable

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,880
like oh it may not be right so and

46
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,740
that's what I am it's like oh look he's

47
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,140
so adorable wait he just stole all our

48
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,740
laptops that's bad it's like so uh

49
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,780
that's the reason why that's uh the

50
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,040
theme but I got Slack for that it's like

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,600
for some reason it's like some people

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,479
were not very happy with my message that

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,880
I was giving out and wearing the shirt

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
that I wear oh this shirt that I'm

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,340
wearing and uh I had some Russian

56
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,960
friends and it's like and they're still

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,399
my friends it's like that we're very

58
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,079
upset thinking that I was trying to

59
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,179
attack Russia and I'm like I'm not

60
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,160
trying to attack Russia it's like I'm

61
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,739
attacking the uh horrible Invasion by

62
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,360
Putin and stuff you know who's hurting

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,879
his own people as well as ukrainians

64
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,379
it's like it's like he's just doing all

65
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,120
kinds of damage that is who I have a

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,700
problem with and I've not only had

67
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,580
problems with just Putin it's like it's

68
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,660
like no

69
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,080
look at this one it's like I in 2003 I

70
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,480
was against the Iraq invasion before it

71
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,879
was cool you know it's like I mean yes

72
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,860
it was horrible thing it's like you know

73
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,660
it's like uh and I loved this picture

74
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,060
because you see the shoe

75
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,700
in our culture the shoe isn't it's just

76
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,800
you know just do it you know it's Nike

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,860
so it's like the tinnies but in uh a lot

78
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,420
of Middle Eastern cultures it's like a

79
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,040
shoe is very insulting if you show the

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,599
soul of your shoe it's like if you're

81
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,860
throwing the shoe or hitting something

82
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,720
that you don't like with a shoe it's

83
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,480
very insulting it's like I mean and I

84
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,739
mean you got to give it to President

85
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,420
George W bush there because he dodged

86
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,379
that shoe like he dodged the

87
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,180
responsibility of killing all the Iraqis

88
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,239
for oil so I mean good on him it's like

89
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,940
so yeah I will speak my mind to trust me

90
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,519
on any kind of issue it's not trying to

91
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,379
be political it's about what's right

92
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,500
it's like with the uh in the 1970s women

93
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,780
in the United States trying to fight for

94
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,239
their rights to exist without everybody

95
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,280
trying to regulate what their bodies do

96
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,080
or how they do it and everything else

97
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,599
and one of the symbols they used was the

98
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,819
bra and they didn't burn the bra that

99
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,739
was a myth it's like what they did was

100
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,959
they just threw them in the trash can

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,239
along with brooms and other items that

102
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,620
were like this is what a woman's

103
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,180
supposed to do and they're like I don't

104
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,680
think so mother this is what we're

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,480
supposed to do luckily the United States

106
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,340
says we've evolved past that we've done

107
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,840
so much oh wait hold on no we haven't

108
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,360
we're still screwed sorry my bad it's

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,879
like and it goes on further it's like

110
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,040
when you look at what's going on in Iran

111
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,319
it's like in the protests that are going

112
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,580
on in there and it's like can you see

113
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,680
people cutting their hair that's very

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
symbolic ever since the Palm oceanara

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
it's like that the Iranian people have

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,299
used and I was like from 100 uh CE I

117
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,420
believe uh the Iranian people have used

118
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,280
cutting their hair as a symbol of

119
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,918
girding for a fight or protesting and

120
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,540
it's like and so that is the reason why

121
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,220
people are cutting their hair so much in

122
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,160
protest right now and Iran it's like so

123
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,080
yeah a lot of these things may not

124
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,419
personally affect me

125
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,419
but that doesn't mean it's less wrong

126
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,280
and it doesn't mean we shouldn't say

127
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,740
something or talk about it so that's the

128
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,660
reason why I had that theme so I'm not

129
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,100
trying to like you know create a message

130
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,680
and say this other group is bad I'm just

131
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,240
saying the current situation that we're

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,240
dealing with is wrong so I got that out

133
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,199
of the way

134
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,000
now we can go like the the most boring

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,199
slide

136
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,419
um I don't like talking about myself I

137
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,280
like riding motorcycles I've been on

138
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,160
television to correcting reporters it

139
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,020
looks like I'm screaming at people on

140
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,699
stage which I will be screaming at you

141
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,040
later so you'll understand I like doing

142
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,740
weird things in weird places and I've

143
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,479
robbed a bank in National Geographic

144
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,100
we'll get more to that more importantly

145
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,080
I love playing no man's Sky still a

146
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,400
great game it's like if you don't have

147
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,840
him played no man's Sky yet you should

148
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,880
it's like it's like Minecraft for old

149
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,580
nerds it's like it's awesome uh so I I

150
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,040
played too much time on that

151
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,680
um I'm done with that and now

152
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,220
this is the worst thing

153
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,860
in information security

154
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,740
humans are the weakest link goodbye you

155
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,199
know it's always stupid user clicked on

156
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,419
a link stupid user went to a website

157
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,060
never stupid information security didn't

158
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,160
properly teach their users

159
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,759
it's like if we actually invested

160
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,060
if we actually invested in our users

161
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,720
like we invest in technology

162
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,880
we would not be having the problems that

163
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,600
we have if we invested in technology

164
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,780
the way we invested in our users you'd

165
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,699
have once nort deployment with the

166
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,100
default rules going on and a PIX

167
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,060
firewall what they allow all uh and no

168
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,660
logging ASA firewall out there on the uh

169
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,120
on on your perimeter going we're done

170
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,100
we're protected

171
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,360
and then wondering why you're getting

172
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,680
breached

173
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,560
we're not investing in trying to educate

174
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,319
our users properly it should not be

175
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,020
getting more technology you know to

176
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,360
protect the users it should be teaching

177
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,000
your users how to protect the technology

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,940
and then using the technology as a

179
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,400
safety net for when they do make a

180
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,039
mistake you're trying to create this you

181
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,139
know big we're gonna well our defenses

182
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,639
look at this big wall we're going to

183
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,900
build a wall and we're going to like you

184
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,180
know make the apts pay for it walls

185
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,979
don't work we've come to know that right

186
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,080
it's like it's like because once that

187
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
wall is breached you're screwed

188
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,759
so why don't you start doing better

189
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,460
about getting response how quickly can

190
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,400
you detect and respond to a breach how

191
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
many people are actually looking and

192
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,580
know what the indicators are of

193
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,620
something not going right and know who

194
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,780
to talk to that's what we have to work

195
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,340
on

196
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,319
because

197
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,020
well that was quick spoiler alert

198
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,300
um it's like so this is another thing

199
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,979
that I really love about information

200
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,020
security it's like our acronyms you know

201
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,639
because we're not tired of those at all

202
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,380
but my favorite one of all time is apt

203
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,380
you know if he stands for right well the

204
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,479
CEO wants you to believe the APT stands

205
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,539
for advanced

206
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,720
threat

207
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,580
Goosebumps right it's like you know it's

208
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,759
like scary it's like no no that that's

209
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,680
what the CEOs tell the the public and

210
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,360
the shareholders when they get popped by

211
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,539
an email it's like in island and honesty

212
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,419
it's like in actuality it's like

213
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,419
Advance uh it's adequate fishing

214
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,280
technique

215
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,280
apt that is what's usually it is it's

216
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,660
like you look through mostly every

217
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,099
single breach that you've come across

218
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,560
you know Target Tony's like oh uh

219
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,660
solarwinds it's like what did it start

220
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,860
off with

221
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,479
an email

222
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,580
maybe we should be fixing how people are

223
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,440
doing the little Clickety clickies than

224
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,060
just you know worried about all the

225
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,639
advanced persistent stuff happening RSA

226
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,160
2011. what what was that is the security

227
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,460
company oh email Yes again that was bad

228
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,300
uh so I'm just bad

229
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,380
I'm not trying to be apt I'm just basic

230
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,620
adorable destruction I'm just coming in

231
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,299
and trying to F you up it's like I don't

232
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,159
care if your PCI Compliant I don't care

233
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,899
about your sarbanes oxygen brings about

234
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,339
any other old white dude I don't care

235
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,320
about any of that stuff I'm just there

236
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,420
to be the worst possible thing that ever

237
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,399
happened to you at the worst possible

238
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,740
time in the worst possible way I'm great

239
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,779
at parties okay it's like but that's

240
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:55,800
what I do

241
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,740
it's like so I'm trying to do that so

242
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,140
let me give you an example of how I like

243
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,880
to be bad and it's like because it's

244
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,279
just it's not Advanced rocket scientists

245
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,380
here people it involves one of the most

246
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,360
advanced hacking tools ever known to man

247
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,700
it's called Google

248
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,940
um and I'm you may not realize this

249
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,040
about me but I'm very Petty sometimes I

250
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,019
can't help it uh when I was first

251
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,940
starting out in 2000 uh getting an

252
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,339
information security I try to get a job

253
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,959
with Ian why and they pass through all

254
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,100
their interviews but I didn't have a

255
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,620
college degree It's like because I was a

256
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,779
high school dropout it's like it's like

257
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,600
and it's like whatever so uh they didn't

258
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,399
let me they didn't find they they didn't

259
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,500
hire me so I don't hold a grudge or

260
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,360
anything but we're going to attack eny

261
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,360
today okay because you know what if

262
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,040
there's anybody from Ian why it's like

263
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,360
don't bother raising her hand I don't

264
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,320
care

265
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,700
um it's like so we're going to go after

266
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,040
Ian why and it's like we're gonna see

267
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,800
what we can do to try to Rob Ian why

268
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,820
um and we want we're talking about

269
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,500
physical compromise let's try to find a

270
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,080
location for e and Y here's some of

271
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,779
their Global Information more here's

272
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,100
their profiles but I'm not trying to get

273
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,519
them from online I want to go

274
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,300
in person right so this is the New York

275
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,339
office of eny I had to go there for a

276
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:12,959
training class once and once again I

277
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,779
said I'm Petty uh so I'm going to attack

278
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,000
them so we're going to go after their

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,080
building

280
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,160
because I want to break into the

281
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,220
building but one problem is people think

282
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,680
that because eny owns the building and

283
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,019
look at that they got that huge nice NY

284
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,459
sign it's like you see the New York

285
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,019
Times Square it's like you know when the

286
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,000
New Year's Day it's like you're like you

287
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,040
gotta love that you know Ian uh Ian

288
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Weinstein they don't run the building

289
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,440
you know you see Tony Stark's name on

290
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,180
the building it's like you know he

291
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,500
doesn't collect the rent from the

292
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,000
Starbucks down there it's like he

293
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,500
doesn't you know make sure the

294
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,180
maintenance crew is doing her job he

295
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,100
doesn't operate the build well he

296
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,120
doesn't operate anything now because

297
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,100
he's passed you know a moment for miss

298
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,260
you Tony but it's like but no it's like

299
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,000
the whole point is is that he doesn't

300
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,920
run the building it's just his name on

301
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,380
it there's a building management company

302
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,120
that runs the building

303
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,300
and no matter how secure Ian why is

304
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,180
this building management company doesn't

305
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,560
care

306
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,519
their job is to rent space their job is

307
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,519
to fill up office space to make money so

308
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,140
they can afford the maintenance and all

309
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,240
the other places and in the light so the

310
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
little lights are shining and stuff

311
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,660
right so they are going to give

312
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,180
potential clients a lot of really good

313
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,680
information

314
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,640
but on one side oh that's very helpful

315
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,380
information and that looks very harmless

316
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,820
and adorable thank you for all this

317
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,740
information but when you take it from a

318
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,540
different context oh

319
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,720
that's not good because thank you

320
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,420
without even having to go there I can

321
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,339
find out where their employees are most

322
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,140
likely going to be eating

323
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,600
it's like I can tell because I mean

324
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,339
let's face it you're a good employee

325
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,660
you're not going to like you know drive

326
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,399
through traffic or trying to take the

327
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,640
the uh the subway down to Canal or

328
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,380
something like that to get some a good

329
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,180
pizza or like you know some good Chinese

330
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,100
food no you're going to just go to one

331
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,300
of these places because it only takes

332
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,279
like five or ten minutes and you're a

333
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,720
hard-working employee you don't be too

334
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,820
far from headquarters right thank you

335
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,620
now I know where to find you know places

336
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,060
where I can like probably do some good

337
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,519
badges or send out coupons to employees

338
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,300
uh for coupons for employees in the area

339
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,640
um hotels oh thank you that is where

340
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,040
your Executives and people from out of

341
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,779
town are going to be staying so they're

342
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,279
right next to headquarters it's like

343
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,899
that's where I start planning some of my

344
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,240
devices and compromising those networks

345
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,700
because trust me there ain't nothing

346
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,680
easier to break into than in a hotel

347
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,600
okay take it from a guy who's robbed

348
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,399
several Barefoot and Teenage Mutant

349
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
Ninja Turtle pajama bottoms it's like so

350
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,839
yes and then you got office Neighbors

351
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,180
which I don't really care about uh so

352
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,200
here we go

353
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,360
but what else do they have on this

354
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,519
website you ask

355
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,200
no one asked but we're going to pretend

356
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,060
you did it's like here we go

357
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,459
blueprints

358
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,180
really

359
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,260
do you know how many bank robbers are

360
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,139
like it's that easy

361
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,360
it's just online

362
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,560
yes

363
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,260
I got building brochures and floor plans

364
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,260
at my disposal that's awesome

365
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,720
and I love this because they highlight

366
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,700
whatever they want you to look it's like

367
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,540
a classic misdirection look at the blue

368
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,040
look at the I didn't filter those that's

369
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,779
just it was blue and yellow already okay

370
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,399
it wasn't part of the theme but it's

371
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,380
like it worked out well but there's the

372
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,540
blue there's the yellow pay attention to

373
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,480
that and I'm like no effing way

374
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,519
that's like do you see what that is

375
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,200
that's like the lobby floor plan there's

376
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
like security guards right there looking

377
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,279
mean and scary looking and stuff they're

378
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,779
gonna question I don't want to go

379
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,420
through those places it's like who wants

380
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,920
to do that

381
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,480
especially when you got this grayed out

382
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,100
area that shows where the loading dock

383
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,779
is where the freight elevator is where

384
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,760
the mail rooms is where the corridors

385
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,920
are and how to enter them that's what

386
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,980
I'm interested in you know why

387
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,660
because it's a lot easier to break into

388
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,220
a building I went to one building where

389
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,540
it's like the guy said no one's ever

390
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,760
succeeded I had the shoe shine guy show

391
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,800
me where the freight elevator was in the

392
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,019
in the loading dock area and the guy

393
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,940
found me at his desk it's like a little

394
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,360
bit later it was awesome it's like uh

395
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,100
but here we go

396
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,060
oh and once I get up look what I've got

397
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,519
I know exactly where the conference

398
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,620
rooms are where the main Executive

399
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,740
offices are but more importantly I know

400
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,360
where I'm going to be walking out and

401
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,980
where the electrical closets are because

402
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,720
you've got these little dark gray areas

403
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,160
and stuff you know it's like they're

404
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,779
hard to see which is horrible right

405
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,040
because it's like you might actually

406
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,019
have to take a moment it's like but yeah

407
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,940
once again it's like look at all these

408
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,500
sections don't pay attention to the

409
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,180
darkness that doesn't exist for you

410
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,160
that's in the shadows for a reason right

411
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,740
so it's like so I love that part why is

412
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,260
that important because once you're

413
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,180
inside the building and trust me I

414
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,040
usually get inside the building I want

415
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,839
to be able to act like I know where I'm

416
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,360
going okay trust me when you see me in

417
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,040
real life day to day I have no idea

418
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,480
where I'm going or what I'm doing okay

419
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,980
but when I'm on the engagement when

420
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,660
you're paying me I have to look at right

421
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,699
it's like I have to leave so when I get

422
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,519
stopped it's like someone says what are

423
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,800
you doing here and I'm going down to

424
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,600
over here by the conference room in

425
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,800
conference room to the right and so if

426
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,060
you go to the electrical closet it's

427
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,620
like we're doing an inspection

428
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,260
oh okay because you know why because

429
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,760
right there by the conference room down

430
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,199
to the right there's another Circle

431
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,320
closet there how would I not know that

432
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,720
if I wasn't supposed to be there

433
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,000
it's like obviously I couldn't have

434
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,680
gotten the blueprints from online that's

435
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,240
just crazy

436
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,620
and remember we were talking about that

437
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,019
dark shaded area don't worry this

438
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,360
company is trying to sell you stuff they

439
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,639
eventually ungrade out for you

440
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,440
so you know exactly where the freight

441
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,060
elevator is where the mail room is going

442
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,920
to be and you know exactly where you're

443
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
going to be coming out when you walk out

444
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,279
the door and the one thing you also got

445
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,260
to remember about freight elevators

446
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,560
they're locked and secured

447
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,959
so you can't just walk into a suite from

448
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,820
the freight elevator you're going to

449
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,260
have to at least hold on to your phone

450
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,820
for about five to ten minutes one time

451
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,680
it took 15 minutes on the phone like

452
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,540
you're talking to somebody until another

453
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,860
employee comes through the freight

454
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,899
elevator and you go and say oh no no

455
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,519
don't worry coming from the offices like

456
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,959
someone's here they'll let me in I

457
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,579
appreciate it thanks and then you're

458
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,320
just walking behind them or even better

459
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,699
yet you listen very closely all the

460
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,980
sensors on the inside they're made to

461
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,139
activate and unlock the door from the

462
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,540
inside when someone walks by

463
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,660
and so you just listen click oh good and

464
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,660
you open the door and go in so that was

465
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,740
hard

466
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,720
um so and one of the other things I love

467
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,540
about it is like wow Jason

468
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,639
that looks like a lot of I did this in

469
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,259
less than 30 minutes it's like this is

470
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,380
not hard okay it's like I did not I was

471
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,480
not in my basement you know on my

472
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,079
computers who has a basement computer

473
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,180
lab It's like because I want one mother

474
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,780
I am so I hate that stereotypical like

475
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,699
hackers in a basement and stuff you know

476
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,099
because I want a basement

477
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,140
I live in Texas we don't have those

478
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,299
those would be so effing awesome it's

479
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,160
like I'll be the first one in there like

480
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,559
and I it it would be called my Lair

481
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,839
don't judge me it's like but it's like

482
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,000
yes I would love one of those but no

483
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,699
it's like I had to use this device at a

484
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,799
Panera Bread having pizza and Diet Pepsi

485
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,559
when I was robbing Ian why it's like and

486
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:32,880
you look at that little gaming device

487
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,039
and it's like and what's what I love

488
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,419
about it is that's an old picture

489
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,240
because my new gaming device thanks to

490
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,640
my my boss at true SEC is way more

491
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,679
advanced because it looks just like a

492
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,200
switch device that has 32 gigs of RAM

493
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
two terabyte of hard drive and an AMD

494
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,580
ryzen processor and can still put mostly

495
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,559
any networks that it comes across and it

496
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,020
plays amazing graphics on video games

497
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,000
though don't tell my CEO I said that

498
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,799
it's like okay it's because it's a it's

499
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,260
a pin testing tool it's like thank you

500
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,679
man no man's sky butter okay it's like

501
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,299
so it's really good but it's like so but

502
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,460
yeah because you why did I put it here

503
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,280
because I'm also in your lobby doing the

504
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,500
same thing because most of your lobbies

505
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
have a Starbucks or a cafe so I can

506
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,360
watch the traffic and see what the

507
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,860
guards look like what the people are

508
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,480
wearing so I can sort of blend in better

509
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,240
when I do go in there for uh from Recon

510
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,860
to actually going to try to break in

511
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,260
it's like I can do all that Recon while

512
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,640
I'm having some hot chocolate at

513
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,020
Starbucks I don't like coffee so it's

514
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,340
like you know it's like so I'm just

515
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,559
doing all that right there

516
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,679
it's like so that's not a good thing but

517
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,600
it's very easy but sometimes I'm also

518
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,580
going through social media It's like

519
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,539
because I want to find out more

520
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,700
information I love the fact that Ernst

521
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,500
Young no I ain't finished dragging them

522
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,900
it's like uh I love the fact that Ernst

523
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,760
actually has their location tagged on

524
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,580
Instagram so you can look instantly at

525
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,340
their location and see who's posted from

526
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,440
those headquarters and I've seen

527
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,780
pictures of internal offices it's like

528
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,880
the insides of places like people's

529
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,700
computers it's just amazing uh and also

530
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,960
you've got different people and stuff

531
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,460
you know it's like the employees are

532
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,280
tagging them and I mean okay understand

533
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,860
I'm not heartless okay it's like I'm not

534
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,480
going to attack this guy he's adorable

535
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,220
okay it's like there's no way I'm gonna

536
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,100
go after him this guy looks sketchy AF

537
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,020
him I'm going after I definitely go

538
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,539
after him okay it's like Not only would

539
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,580
I go after him I would look at all the

540
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,980
people that are commenting on both posts

541
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,200
and they'd probably be potential targets

542
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,280
too okay it's like so I would do that uh

543
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,600
once again on the Instagram you know

544
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,820
it's like I love how people always talk

545
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,380
about like you know you have to you have

546
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,840
to once you broke it into a company it's

547
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,760
like into the network it's like you have

548
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,860
to make sure you do a scan on the

549
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,240
network so you can fingerprint the

550
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,860
devices and stuff you don't know what

551
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,080
kind of devices are running it's like

552
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,299
what kind of uh operating systems

553
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,799
they're running it's like what kind of

554
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,480
equipment they're using it's actually

555
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,280
you understand exactly how you can do

556
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,059
the mother haven't you heard of LinkedIn

557
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,220
look at the job posting on their site

558
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,900
they'll tell you exactly what equipment

559
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,400
they're using what operating systems

560
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,080
you're using what programs they're using

561
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,820
and it's like if and if they're not

562
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,400
having the jobs open right then look for

563
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,020
the current employees and look what

564
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,580
they're being endorsed on and what their

565
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,260
strengths are because then that's what

566
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,780
they're using it's like or you can just

567
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,460
go on social media and actually see for

568
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,620
yourself it's like they're using Mobile

569
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,160
iPhone devices and they're using HP and

570
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,440
some Lenovo laptops oh Lenovo laptops

571
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,179
those those are nice those nothing can

572
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,340
do with those right it's like oh sorry

573
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,740
hashtag too soon it's like yeah it's

574
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,059
like there's a yeah there's a lot of

575
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,380
nice little things that you can get out

576
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,700
there just from the social media

577
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,200
pictures

578
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,820
and if you want to know why security

579
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,480
people drink just Google hashtag new

580
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,299
badge it's like on Instagram or Twitter

581
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,179
it makes you sad it's like because it

582
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,280
still works it's like I actually use

583
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,600
that to break into a company once it

584
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,120
took me 15 minutes uh to get a new badge

585
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,460
for an employee and I also love the fact

586
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,380
that they have the keys there that

587
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,620
actually showing you how to make a key

588
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,080
that's awesome it's like the whole you

589
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
know Department of Homeland Security I

590
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,280
know hilarious stop laughing it's like

591
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,500
uh they literally actually one of their

592
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,960
uh magazine articles

593
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,980
showed the picture of all the TSA keys

594
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,380
it's like and you're like well why is

595
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,020
that bad I now have a copy of all the

596
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,020
TSA Keys 3D printed

597
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,000
you don't want me with any anything

598
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,799
saying that Jason's got the keys to

599
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,220
should make you feel afraid okay and

600
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,500
it's like in the in the tsa's response

601
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,840
Department of Homeland Security the same

602
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,220
people that want all the keys to all

603
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,559
your digital devices were like well

604
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,419
those locks weren't really meant for

605
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,559
protection

606
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,600
it's like it's like we wouldn't really

607
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,919
mean development and I'm like thanks

608
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,080
that's very reassuring it's like you

609
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,179
know so just remember that the next time

610
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,100
uh you hear them trying to ask for more

611
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,559
encryption keys but yeah that's that's

612
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,419
the problem with uh having keys in

613
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,039
social media because you know what else

614
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,320
you can have in your in your hands very

615
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,220
quickly

616
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,280
especially if you're on Amazon Prime

617
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,280
the baggy 100

618
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,640
the only way this thing can be cooler if

619
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
it was called the badge 3000 the only

620
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,539
way this could be cooler

621
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:27,960
literally for under 700 it's like uh you

622
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,400
know which is probably you know twenty

623
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,480
dollars Euro I don't know what the

624
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,700
conversion rate is but still under seven

625
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,520
hundred dollars it's like in US Dollars

626
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,419
you can get a badge maker

627
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,240
so you see the picture on the thing you

628
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,980
print it out edit it in Photoshop it's

629
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,840
like boom it's like trust me we're all

630
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,220
on Twitter we know how to use Photoshop

631
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,140
right it's like and then you like you

632
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,179
and you print it up and you print your

633
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,220
own copy of the badge

634
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,580
how easy is that and and I love some of

635
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,280
the naysayers always go like Jason

636
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,340
but it doesn't have an RFID chip

637
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,900
how are you going to get in without a

638
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,000
heart and I'm like I've got a prox mark

639
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,860
cloner it's like I've got the Xbox I got

640
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,440
I got the uh boss clone I got all the

641
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,860
I've never used them to break in

642
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,620
that requires you know talent and skill

643
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,940
and technical stuff I don't have time

644
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,799
for that

645
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,100
I literally walk up to the door knowing

646
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,860
I don't have an RFID chip in the badge I

647
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,080
just printed and I go up to the reader

648
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,199
now

649
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,100
foreign

650
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,200
hello I got a meeting in five minutes

651
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,140
can you please open the door

652
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,700
it's like hello white guy

653
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,799
in a suit what's the use of having male

654
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,419
privilege it's like white male privilege

655
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:49,740
if you can't say how bad it is right

656
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,900
it's like come on

657
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,240
open the door and they usually open the

658
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,299
door for me it's like so

659
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,620
who needs to you know RFID chips

660
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,679
so I got a question for you uh do you

661
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,419
think where you work is more secure for

662
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,280
infiltration and compromise than a bank

663
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,780
which understands it is aware that

664
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,120
people will try to rob it

665
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,419
I have told a lot of a lot of retelling

666
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,340
of some of my adventures and exploits

667
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,679
over the years and one of the things

668
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,460
that I always find hard to believe

669
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,780
okay

670
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,419
is that that stuff is true

671
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,940
like legit I mean I don't believe half

672
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,380
the stuff that's happened to me and I

673
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,419
was there for it it's like but I did

674
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,419
give everyone film this time I did

675
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,640
So and I've gotten a lot of flack from a

676
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,260
lot of people a lot of my haters and a

677
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,700
lot of my attractors love to talk about

678
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,120
how I'm not technical or I don't really

679
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,860
do a lot of advanced attacking and I'm

680
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,640
like yeah you're you're perfectly yeah

681
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,039
you make some very good points it's like

682
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,679
I'm not technical it's like I'm not

683
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,840
someone that's going to I don't know how

684
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,880
to program

685
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,880
I literally my youngest child we did the

686
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,220
python for kids it's like using

687
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,380
Minecraft they did better I wasn't even

688
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,659
that great at Minecraft it's like so

689
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,120
it's like so yeah no I'm not a good

690
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,280
programmer I'm still a hacker I still

691
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,720
belong here so let's watch a video of me

692
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,100
robbing a bank

693
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,860
and let's see how my non-technical self

694
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,380
how long it takes me to get in from the

695
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,779
front door of the bank to compromising

696
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,760
the first machine and please understand

697
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,700
the bank is not really open at this

698
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,440
moment it's like they're in a lunch

699
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,320
break time and I still walk in when I

700
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,760
shouldn't because the sensor opened up

701
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,039
so let's go to the next one

702
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,080
and let's watch to see how long it takes

703
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,419
let's do the whole maybe if I just do

704
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,200
that there we go

705
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,440
here we go I love her she's amazing

706
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,140
because she knows I'm sketchy AF look at

707
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,940
the look on her face

708
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,520
she knows I don't believe it she did

709
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,620
everything correct except for one little

710
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,779
mistake she did everything correct oh

711
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,580
and by the way if you're counting it's

712
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,500
15 seconds from walking the front door

713
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,539
to compromising the first machine is how

714
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,700
long it takes me 15 seconds

715
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,460
uh in 20 seconds the payload is already

716
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,120
deploying

717
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,179
payload deployed

718
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,059
closing it out unplugging it in under 30

719
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,700
seconds compromise the first machine

720
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,039
that was technical

721
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,779
um and then here she comes over doing

722
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,880
another thing she stops me and questions

723
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,080
me

724
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,120
I immediately start off on the offense

725
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,279
like bonjour I'm supposed to be here I'm

726
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,900
doing a USB audit

727
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,179
you ask Jason what's a USB audit I have

728
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,860
no other thing I did but I do a lot of

729
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,659
them

730
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,179
it's like and instead of trying to be

731
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,580
defensive I'm being assertive mode like

732
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,159
I'm here didn't headquarters call you

733
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,340
it's like I'm here to try to do that

734
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,020
you're supposed to and then she did the

735
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,460
right thing she said can you talk to the

736
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,419
manager

737
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,760
I was like sure no problem let's go talk

738
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,679
to the manager

739
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,559
but here's the problem right here

740
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,779
she expected me to be honest

741
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,580
she says part on she gets the manager's

742
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,039
attention and I just miss her go I'll

743
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,419
Stand By and she's like oh you look

744
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,520
honest okay I'll believe you and she

745
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,400
leaves so I go straight into him and I

746
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,900
take the passive roles like oh here I'm

747
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,820
doing the USB audit and he thinks that

748
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,100
she vetted me she thinks he's going to

749
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,440
vet me no one vetted me and now I'm

750
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,940
compromising the manager's computer

751
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,640
that's awkward it's like

752
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,580
thank you it's like

753
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,500
and he asked me what I was doing and I

754
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,179
was like I'm trying to make the network

755
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:47,400
faster I'm like you tell anybody they

756
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,080
could be on a T1 line directly to their

757
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,460
desktop you tell them you're making the

758
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,740
network faster or if you ask them is the

759
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,779
network running slow yeah

760
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,340
yeah I think it is I'm here to make it

761
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,220
fast what do you need me I need access

762
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,919
to the data center

763
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,559
can you give me that that's my trusted

764
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,360
agent he's like too close to me and I'm

765
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,500
trying to get him a far away because

766
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,760
it's like I'm not trying to rob the

767
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,200
people it's an educational experience

768
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,240
and I don't want to get eventually I try

769
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,520
to get caught at some point uh sometimes

770
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,740
it doesn't happen like this one spoiler

771
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,700
alert

772
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,039
um and this is unedited video so sorry

773
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,140
for the butt cam but uh I didn't want

774
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,880
you to think that I got cut and spliced

775
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,320
it or try to make it look cooler than it

776
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,059
was it's like this is literally the

777
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,340
whole thing as it happens uh so we're

778
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,539
walking up to the data center

779
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,460
it's long walk

780
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,980
there we go enters the code which I'm

781
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,840
sure I didn't copy down

782
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,580
and he lets me in

783
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,200
and this is I just want to see if he'd

784
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,720
let me alone in this data center I'll be

785
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,919
down there in a second you can go to the

786
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,900
teller it's like to go to the teller and

787
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,880
then I dismiss them

788
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,279
and then you're not hearing the audio so

789
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,140
you don't hear my sigh of like sadness

790
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,360
like

791
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,299
because I want them to win if you're red

792
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,039
team and you're not rooting for the blue

793
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,600
team you suck

794
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,520
the only reason why the red team exists

795
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,679
is to make the blue team better and it's

796
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,960
like so but then I also realized wait

797
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,880
he's my golden ticket and that girl was

798
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,399
on point she may go talk to him so I got

799
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,399
to catch up with that guy real quick

800
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,020
you're staying close to me you're my

801
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,580
golden ticket you know it's

802
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,059
like you don't go anywhere

803
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,980
so now we're going behind the teller

804
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,720
line

805
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,480
do you know how many uh bank robbers and

806
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,580
ski masks and shotguns are going

807
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,039
that easy

808
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,980
and caramelizing machine

809
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,480
this was this was nice

810
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,880
and I just decided halfway through this

811
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,200
I was like I wonder if I could get 100

812
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,320
of all the machines in this engagement

813
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,120
just you know for the lulls

814
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,940
and then look at this rude mother I was

815
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,559
so upset

816
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,200
how rude he locked his workstation when

817
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,640
he left

818
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,520
I can't Rob him like that

819
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,220
but it's okay it's okay don't don't I

820
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,779
know I was a little mad I get hotheaded

821
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,100
but the manager got the employee to come

822
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,600
over and unlock his workstation for me

823
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,678
that was a close one

824
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,140
so I'm limited with my French I'm sorry

825
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,179
it's like

826
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,020
trying to be funny

827
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,179
I know enough French

828
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,100
to get the French pissed off about me

829
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,419
speaking French for them to switch to

830
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:40,799
English that's about as much as the

831
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,520
French as I know

832
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,100
and now we're going to the vault

833
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,779
this is where the real money is not the

834
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,880
big shiny thing this is the vault

835
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,919
and this is the most powerful employee

836
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,980
in the bank right now you know why

837
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,640
she's the one doing the wire transfers

838
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,299
so I'm now on the computer that responds

839
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,039
to the wire transfers for millions of

840
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,539
dollars hundred thousand dollars all

841
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,059
that oh she's in the middle of doing a

842
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:12,000
wire transfer right now

843
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,140
that's not awkward

844
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:16,980
and oh there it was right there it's

845
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,640
like my bad and oh code executed

846
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,159
there we go

847
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,559
and I am like reeling at this time

848
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,419
because now I've gotten mostly all the

849
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,600
machines and uh but then I remembered

850
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,179
something as I'm walking out

851
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,580
um and I think we've already covered it

852
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,740
I'm very Petty

853
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,080
and I wanted to get a hundred percent

854
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,559
so of course I needed to go after the

855
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:46,020
one one more person I didn't get her

856
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,700
machine

857
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,000
so with the manager behind me I go back

858
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,980
to the one employee that did everything

859
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,679
correct and I compromised her machine

860
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,980
too

861
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,960
remember the kittens okay it's like I'm

862
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,840
being paid to be a bad guy right now

863
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,260
so I didn't compromise that machine

864
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,539
and I want you to think it sounds we've

865
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:11,100
been like joking laughing but understand

866
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,220
one important thing it's like this could

867
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,600
have been anybody

868
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,760
this was not just because of them or the

869
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,940
location it's human nature is what I was

870
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,080
attacking

871
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,520
it's like we have to be under

872
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,640
understanding that it's like uh and I

873
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,980
left and it's like and I hold on we got

874
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,240
to finish with this one part here like

875
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,100
because I really this is honestly what I

876
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,539
said

877
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:36,659
how the did that just happen I was just

878
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,720
as surprised as anybody else okay but we

879
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,640
understand when we talk about this and

880
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,580
you see these it's like it's very easy

881
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,620
to go and say I can't believe they fell

882
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,480
for that mother you would fall for it

883
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,720
too okay a lot of these ways that I do

884
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,720
this it's like I have robbed all over

885
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,700
the world different cultures different

886
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,820
people different industries from Banks

887
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,159
to hotels to research facilities to

888
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,020
government installations it's like

889
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,360
sometimes on with permission it's like

890
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,059
all those places it's like I have gone

891
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:13,039
after now let's watch one more video

892
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,779
because we're going to just see

893
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:18,600
how it just takes one thing

894
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,120
because before it was just the ladies

895
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,000
letting me stand there now I'm going to

896
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,519
use something that's an inanimate object

897
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,559
to commit this crime

898
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,659
see the lady behind me there me walking

899
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,760
in from the public space and then I go

900
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,019
around

901
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,480
after a moment and I walked straight

902
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,880
into the teller line

903
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,100
yeah I'm supposed to be here

904
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,019
I look legit look at that suit man

905
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,419
that's a nice shiny jacket right there I

906
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,580
obviously you know I'm supposed to be

907
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,380
here

908
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,840
I go to the last machine in the line

909
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,779
that is unplugged and not even attached

910
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,120
to a monitor and no power and I start

911
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,519
the process why because I want to

912
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,659
establish the pattern

913
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,700
then I can go to the next one and like

914
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,639
oh yeah I'm doing doing my USB Rod audit

915
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,280
again you know those old USB audits

916
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,080
they're not going to audit themselves

917
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,659
now this other lady I could tell by her

918
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,580
body language she ain't having me she's

919
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,899
like in the middle of doing something

920
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:24,960
really work related so I do bank robbing

921
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,520
101

922
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,500
spit in the chair until they're ready

923
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,940
it's like and she's like I have a lot of

924
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,500
work I said I know you do and I'm just

925
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,879
gonna it's gonna take one moment to rob

926
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,618
you just give me a second it's like

927
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,359
she was so pissed at me she didn't get

928
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,918
any happier after she found out that

929
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,199
what I was doing for real it's like but

930
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,339
yeah

931
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,379
um and then I walk out

932
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,659
and now I'm coming from the teller the

933
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,940
private area again

934
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,800
and I compromised the lady that was

935
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,480
right behind me on the phone because I'm

936
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,700
not coming from the public area

937
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,439
do you know what made this possible

938
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,820
that column

939
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,160
is the only reason why I got away with

940
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,180
that

941
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,460
if I would have walked in straight from

942
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,520
the public area and walked into the

943
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,619
teller line those tellers would be like

944
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:19,320
what the are you doing here

945
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,660
you're not supposed to be here

946
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,980
because they would have seen me coming

947
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,440
from the outside

948
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,720
but they didn't see me coming they saw

949
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,359
me coming from the outside but then they

950
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:33,359
saw me turn and go this way out of their

951
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,839
site where this lady was on her phone

952
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:39,300
so therefore in their mind just human

953
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,300
nature you're thinking oh they must have

954
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,339
been you know talking to him he must

955
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:45,960
have been talking to them he must have

956
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,820
gotten clearance and now he's coming

957
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,579
from a private Direction he's legit it's

958
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,859
like spoiler alert I'm never legit it's

959
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,660
like and I also don't quit but there we

960
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,359
go so that's the way you attack

961
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,520
so after seeing this

962
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,140
you sure hope that your company is

963
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,400
protected but you probably know

964
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,839
unfortunately your company would not

965
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,400
fare much better

966
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,579
so we don't look at these examples as

967
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,859
something to mock or make fun of we look

968
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:13,020
at these examples to learn from because

969
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,720
your company could probably very well be

970
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,820
susceptible to this stuff as well it's

971
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,079
like and these are things that you have

972
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,000
to look out for

973
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,880
because it all breaks down I'm not going

974
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,540
after technology or o days to get in you

975
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,460
know it's like I'm attacking your people

976
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,500
using the perceptions and expectations

977
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,940
against them

978
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,980
it's like human perceptions are

979
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,839
different one of the best things about

980
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,359
me being on the spectrum is the fact

981
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,400
that it's like I had to learn how human

982
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,859
nature works because normal people

983
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,800
frighten the out of me okay it's like

984
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,960
and so I've learned to study human

985
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,880
nature figure out what's going on and

986
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,160
humans are weird it's like and it's like

987
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,040
in the way they react it's like if I can

988
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,800
perceive that I am safe

989
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,339
it's like then I will allow myself to

990
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,320
accept more risk

991
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,020
it's like so if you're out in the lobby

992
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,220
or you're going to the parking lot

993
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,800
you're very aware of your surroundings

994
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,020
it's like but if you're sitting at your

995
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,920
desk you perceive that you're in a safe

996
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,240
secured environment because you had to

997
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,940
go through security to get in there you

998
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,040
got to go it's like the TSA that's the

999
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,780
reason why the TSA is social joke you

1000
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,240
know it's like oh my gosh it's like look

1001
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,920
how horrible this is it's so

1002
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,300
uncomfortable to go through this whole

1003
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,060
process right I take so much technology

1004
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,820
that is so bad it's like but I don't

1005
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,680
take four ounces of toothpaste so we

1006
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,440
must be secure okay and that's the way

1007
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,240
that works it's like it's it's that

1008
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,859
perception that once we've had to go

1009
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,220
through this process we're better off so

1010
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,560
sorry to drag the TSA too much but I

1011
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,579
don't care

1012
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,160
um so let's go over perception more it's

1013
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,560
like look at these two pictures I took

1014
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,200
these two pictures one day apart

1015
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,020
less than 24 hours apart I took these

1016
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,160
two pictures

1017
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,020
watch the most remarkable thing about

1018
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,320
them one is day one I've got my goatee

1019
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,900
hair ungelled wearing your company's

1020
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,060
Computer Guy shirt because I'm funny and

1021
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,920
I come with warning labels and I've got

1022
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,900
a couple hidden devices in it the next

1023
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,079
day I'm wearing a nice dress shirt uh

1024
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,359
different uh watch and you know got my

1025
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,859
hair gelled looking all nice and on

1026
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,660
fleek and so I know people don't use

1027
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,740
that word anymore but I'm bringing it

1028
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,599
back and but what's the most important

1029
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,839
part

1030
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,940
it's snowing outside

1031
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,760
it's effing cold I'm from Texas I am

1032
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,339
freezing my butt off right now

1033
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:42,020
why don't I have a jacket

1034
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,880
why am I not wearing a I know your first

1035
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,680
response is well Jason you're crazy now

1036
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,839
and I can't argue with that okay that's

1037
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:52,200
that that's true but still why am I not

1038
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,240
wearing a jacket because once I break

1039
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,240
into your facility and spoiler alert I

1040
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,820
broke into that facility I'm now walking

1041
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,180
through their office with no jacket on

1042
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,720
so what does that mean that means I must

1043
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,640
have already put my jacket in the office

1044
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,220
or in the conference room I've already

1045
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,500
been there for a while and I had taken

1046
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,119
my jacket off already

1047
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,880
if I would have showed up in a parka or

1048
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,579
a big which I wanted or uh at least a

1049
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:23,339
big jacket and walking around trying to

1050
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:24,480
act like I'm supposed to be there

1051
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,740
they're like why do you still have a

1052
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,880
jacket on

1053
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,980
did you just come from outside

1054
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,619
but no I didn't come from outside I

1055
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,119
couldn't have it's like I don't have my

1056
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,040
jacket on with me what kind of crazy

1057
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,660
person doesn't wear a jacket in this

1058
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,480
weather it's like well you know besides

1059
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,300
me so that's what it is it's just that

1060
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,880
simple perception

1061
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,619
and I use different perceptions oh we're

1062
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,020
like I'm running oh my gosh she wants me

1063
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,480
off the stage okay so I got three

1064
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,880
different kinds of uh attack sectors

1065
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,560
I've got the OMG the uh the passive uh

1066
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,320
and the assertive role it's like and

1067
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,460
each one of those I was actually

1068
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,859
conducting attack yes I I taped the

1069
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,260
computer to a piece of cardboard and no

1070
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,700
one gave me money anyway so they

1071
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,000
deserved what they got okay it's like

1072
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,780
um

1073
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,380
so the third row is layer uh Layer Two

1074
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,420
it's like where it's like I'm trying to

1075
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,400
be I'm doing an audit it's like I'm

1076
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,660
trying to be assertive I'm trying I'm

1077
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,400
not trying to be rude but I'm trying to

1078
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,260
be like I need to get this done I need

1079
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,060
you to help me because I'm actually

1080
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,099
helping you and I'm taking time out of

1081
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,960
my day to get this stuff done you need

1082
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,839
to do it I'm usually wearing uh this

1083
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,339
night suits like my business suit of

1084
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:38,220
Doom which is really cool uh because

1085
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,920
it's got pockets I'm sorry ladies it's

1086
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,240
like I know it's got pockets and I'm

1087
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,440
rubbing that in but it's like I don't

1088
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,060
know why Western culture women can have

1089
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,560
pockets and men can't wear purses

1090
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,359
because it's like I love my purse but

1091
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,579
still that's besides the point uh the

1092
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,579
sleeves got bash bunnies in them

1093
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,260
uh I got three different hacking devices

1094
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,800
there it's like the video pin the video

1095
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,660
recorder watch with the USB hard drive

1096
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,700
but what's the other one Jason what's

1097
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,079
the other hacking device you've got

1098
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,079
there I've got cufflinks it's like one's

1099
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,180
a USB wireless adapter the other one has

1100
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,099
the command a two gig drive with the

1101
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,140
command and control and drivers for

1102
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,599
Windows Mac and Linux in it it's like so

1103
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,599
I can turn your CEO's desktop or your

1104
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,660
server into a wireless access router out

1105
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,240
of your network which is what we

1106
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,578
technically call in the business as bad

1107
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,619
uh also I love this picture because look

1108
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,000
at that it's like when you see in the

1109
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,160
movies the Assassin it's like or the

1110
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,320
secret agent they reveal that big wall

1111
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,240
of all the guns and everything and then

1112
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,160
they take the little pistol

1113
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,320
and I'm like because because you see all

1114
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,599
that you're intimidated but I don't use

1115
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,940
half that stuff it's like there's some

1116
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,099
of those devices I've never used but it

1117
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,079
looks cool don't it

1118
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,359
it looks like I know what I'm doing

1119
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:56,460
I got all this don't make me use them

1120
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,839
right

1121
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,760
it's like

1122
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,940
so the layer one is a passive it's like

1123
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,380
where I'm working at the help desk you

1124
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,820
know I'm trying to help you out I'm

1125
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,160
trying to work I'm trying to help you do

1126
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,420
things and I'm usually using my

1127
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,300
clipboard of Doom and I'm using these

1128
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,920
envelopes which are really nice because

1129
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,560
you know uh the envelopes are the most

1130
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,660
deadliest weapon I've got in my Arsenal

1131
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,460
because I just go buy one of your

1132
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,680
location one of your cubicles or one of

1133
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,720
your offices where you're not in there

1134
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,420
and it's got your name on it uh on the

1135
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,640
on the door and I just write your name

1136
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,820
on the envelope put a malware USB drive

1137
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,280
in the envelope seal the envelope and

1138
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,140
leave it on your desk

1139
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,240
and then walk away

1140
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,400
who's not going to plug that in with an

1141
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,140
envelope sealed with their name on it

1142
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,960
and a USB drive on it it's like who's

1143
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,640
got time to dump them in a parking lot

1144
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,859
I'm no Mr Robot I don't have time for

1145
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,540
that

1146
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,280
it's like there are some other devices

1147
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,900
that look really scary and I've actually

1148
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,420
used a few of them

1149
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,520
and then the OMG labor is just what I'm

1150
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,200
winging it it's like I've been a TV

1151
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,420
producer it's like I've been all kinds

1152
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,220
of weird things just to see if I could

1153
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,920
get away with doing them uh I robbed a

1154
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,540
hotel in the south of France and that's

1155
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,920
be actually in the south of France in

1156
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,140
the crappy hotel that they put me up in

1157
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,119
because they couldn't afford me for all

1158
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,859
the nights in the hotel I was robbing

1159
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:19,440
it's not a bad view though uh it's like

1160
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,359
and there's a picture of me Barefoot my

1161
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:22,680
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle pajama

1162
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,119
bottoms that I actually used to rob the

1163
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:26,460
company in and I'm usually using just

1164
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,980
like a USB device uh or just a pen

1165
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,180
something small

1166
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,300
so let's just remember if I do find a

1167
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,200
way in and I usually do it's like you

1168
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,700
then make sure your employees know how

1169
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,339
to respond once I'm in there and now we

1170
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:42,780
get to the part where I talk to you

1171
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,640
about all the defenses and how we can

1172
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,319
make things better and how we can do

1173
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,420
things to make things better uh but we

1174
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,339
don't have time for that because I'm

1175
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,380
running long and I'm a horrible person

1176
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,359
so we're going to leave it there thank

1177
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:55,850
you

1178
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,179
[Applause]

thank you my thank you very much Jason

1180
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,339

1181
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:10,500
at 15 minutes behind 16 minutes behind

1182
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
the schedule

1183
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,940
I will definitely be outside for a while

1184
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,680
so y'all can come up to me afterwards

1185
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,480
and talk to me because I know that I'm

1186
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,099
running long and everybody's all the

1187
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:21,420
other speakers I know are pissed at me

1188
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,900
so I'm sorry hi yes uh I have one

1189
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,480
interesting question uh when you were

1190
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,119
installing some payloads didn't they

1191
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,119
have some kind of antivirus

1192
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,359
I'm sorry I when you were in selling

1193
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,099
payloads

1194
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,680
yeah didn't they have some kind of

1195
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,119
antivirus

1196
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,260
oh no virus no I am not antivirus

1197
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,520
like

1198
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,859
I'm sorry oh it doesn't matter if they

1199
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,440
have antivirus it's like my uh thing was

1200
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,420
like it was imitating imitating a

1201
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,420
keyboard so I was literally running a

1202
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,700
command like it was the local user

1203
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,859
except for the actual keyboard it was

1204
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:04,680
that device it's like I could use I've

1205
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,420
got a payload that actually just opens

1206
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,400
up it's got a network adapter on it and

1207
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,819
it's got a wireless I mean a USB a

1208
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:15,240
network adapter a USB keyboard drivers

1209
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,280
and device inside it with the hard drive

1210
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,980
and it plugs in It's called The Bash

1211
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,560
Bunny and it just plugs in and then what

1212
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,319
it does is it net uses and creates a

1213
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:29,520
drive and then ftps or and shares the my

1214
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,579
documents to that drive on its own

1215
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,380
little internal private Network those

1216
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,060
are all internal Windows commands that

1217
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,680
are totally legal and allowed there is

1218
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,780
no payload there's no need to be a virus

1219
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,300
and I'm not trying to do something bad

1220
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,280
to them I'm trying to make a teachable

1221
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,140
moment it's about education not

1222
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,599
exploitation it's like so what mine does

1223
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,700
is it just opens up notepad and it

1224
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,339
writes yeah this just happened smiley

1225
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:55,200
face that's it that's the payload

1226
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,339
because I'm just trying to make them

1227
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,380
aware that I could have done something

1228
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,300
bad I don't want them to worry about if

1229
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,859
I did or not

1230
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,540
thank you

1231
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,280
