1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,580
foreign

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,519
spot in the second day or in the last

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,920
day after lunch but let's see how it

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,880
goes

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,480
uh so hi everybody my name is Radu I'm

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,080
uh yes Graciela said a network architect

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,000
and I'll try to speak a little bit about

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,580
well networks and network architecture

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,380
in um

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,880
in the new world because we haven't

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,800
heard so much about this in the past two

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,660
days

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,719
so first of all to set the stage a lot

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,460
of things have happened in the in the

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,500
past years

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,719
especially in the network space so a

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,059
couple of years back we will all of a

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,940
sudden went home to work from home

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,040
all of us at the same time and it was

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,719
quite a challenge for a network

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,640
throughout the world to keep up

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
and I guess we did a quite a good job as

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,100
an industry as an IT industry in these

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,320
past two years so now working from home

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,059
is The New Normal everybody is doing

26
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,440
that

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,899
more or less than some who would want

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,260
but it's working one other thing that

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,220
started happening a while back is that a

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,780
lot of things

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,820
that weren't previously connected to a

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,979
network now are

33
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,680
and

34
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,500
this is still happening and it's one of

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,680
the reasons why we have all of these

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,240
security problems right everything is

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,240
getting connected to everything at the

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,540
same time wherever they are where we are

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,560
now uh working from Siemens which is not

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,340
necessarily the youngest and uh

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,979
it's not quite a startup right it has

42
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,680
quite a while existing

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,799
uh we are still trying to adapt as a as

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,259
a company and to lead this change to the

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,720
new world uh and this is a little bit

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,540
what I wanted to talk to you about

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,500
so first of all uh in these days

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,299
a lot of things are happening some of

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,600
them are pretty hilarious so uh this is

50
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,880
actually a real thing and everybody now

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,099
has light bulbs all of you have like

52
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,959
smart light bulbs at home or other smart

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,160
things at home

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,180
which are not really usually hardened

55
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,099
enough or are not state of the art when

56
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,220
it comes to drivers and uh network

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,959
interfaces and how they handle things

58
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,720
and these kind of things well are funny

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,239
when they happen in a lab or at home

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,180
but when they happen in a big company or

61
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,599
in a public institution or God forbidson

62
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,340
and I don't know power plant or

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,900
something like that it's stopped being

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,040
funny

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,980
sometimes it's even a privacy problem

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,819
and this is actually a real thing that

67
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,958
can happen these days

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,239
well

69
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,220
this is a definition I am not into this

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,640
so much into these dense things but I

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,739
find this definition of what Zen is on

72
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,260
the well on Google and it kind of

73
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,360
applies to how how whatever we're

74
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
heading to the networks these days

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,019
because now everything is connected and

76
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,000
everything changes and we need to pay

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,440
attention and to learn from what's

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
Happening and to adapt the architectures

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,680
of the networks and of these security

80
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,720
systems in order to cope with with all

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,819
of these changes

82
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,120
so what's going on with regards to

83
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,680
network security

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,080
traditionally the way not only

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,120
traditionally I think that to a certain

86
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,519
extent is the status quo even today

87
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,040
we are defending our networks or our

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,620
locations or our data centers or power

89
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,739
assets with uh something that was

90
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,159
thought of uh quite a while ago we built

91
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,599
a big wall around it

92
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,760
we Define walking path that people can

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,340
or devices or packets can take through

94
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,560
this through this Castle

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,080
and at the entry gate we check everybody

96
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,780
that comes in see if it's a good guy

97
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,720
he's allowed to get in right so this is

98
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,340
a traditional way of also doing network

99
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,099
security you build a big perimeter you

100
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,540
put in a gate where your control who's

101
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,180
coming in you define some policies there

102
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,540
if that somebody got in there they're

103
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,739
good they're fine they have access to

104
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,780
everything as long as they walk the the

105
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,639
paths that were defined

106
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,380
but actually the new world looks more

107
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,620
like this so there is no really a wall

108
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,139
anymore and you don't really know where

109
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,240
everything is going

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,880
and where the bad guys are or who is

111
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,699
inside those much each one of these

112
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,759
we call it attack surface today

113
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,960
so in this new world

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,699
one of the approaches that is widely

115
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,400
popular and it's called zero trust it's

116
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,660
what I want to talk about it's a very

117
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,979
good thing that actually this is

118
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,060
happening

119
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,820
I wanted to to look at this totally

120
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,199
different and say forget all this

121
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,259
network security let's we cannot do it

122
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,360
anymore let's change a little bit how we

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
do things and just Define some

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
principles and we started from they

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,000
started and defined the standard

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,460
actually from simple things like uh

127
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,320
you should always assume that something

128
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,240
has been breached when you design

129
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,880
networks and architecture you should

130
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,600
never allow a user a device or something

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,699
or somebody to have more access than

132
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,620
they actually need in order to get the

133
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,600
role or their job

134
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,539
you all you can you also need to do

135
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,120
smaller segments in the network and in

136
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560
the security space

137
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,620
and things normal things like

138
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,060
multi-factor that now I won't talk about

139
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,020
because everybody this is these days

140
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,100
and this somehow translated into well a

141
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,060
standard whoops

142
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,380
I think I'm missing a slide

143
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,060
bear with me

144
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,249
[Applause]

145
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,419
okay I'll talk through it so basically

146
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,560
the idea of zero trust is that

147
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,820
um

148
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,280
a standard has been defined by an well

149
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,460
well-known uh institution in the United

150
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,740
States that's called zero trust

151
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,220
architecture what that said is that

152
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,759
in order to make everything safe you

153
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,380
should forget all of these controls that

154
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,600
are placed everywhere

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,560
and follow some simple rules and an

156
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,300
architecture should be defined with some

157
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,400
elements and I'll let you read through

158
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,500
that because as any standards it's quite

159
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,360
cumbersome

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,660
but there are some basic things that

161
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,400
were defined which are quite important

162
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,620
these days one is that you should never

163
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,880
Grant somebody access to anything based

164
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,160
on where they come from so the tradition

165
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,080
of doing things is that in many

166
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,479
locations or companies if you're inside

167
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,340
the network you get attached maybe you

168
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,500
get authenticated maybe not depending if

169
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,840
you're on wired or Wireless it doesn't

170
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,580
matter even if you are authenticated the

171
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,319
de facto standard is that you get access

172
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,440
to the network you get you get a link

173
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,800
you can get access to to anything that's

174
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,460
there's gun that's

175
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,220
we are moving away from from that model

176
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,860
some other pretty important things are

177
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,419
related to zero trust like you should

178
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,340
always authenticate everything and after

179
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,319
you authenticate something you need to

180
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,360
authorize if they are in entitled to

181
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,520
access that application

182
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,199
uh one other thing is that everything

183
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,620
should be encrypted and The Good Old Log

184
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,419
everything and look at the logs and

185
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,020
monitor everything

186
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,780
the motto of the zero trust architecture

187
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,660
is Never Trust always verify

188
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,660
which is all good and fine and it's an

189
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,360
approach that has been widely adopted at

190
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,580
least as a strategy by many companies in

191
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,840
this world

192
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,419
and uh

193
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,300
what does this mean now now talking on

194
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,400
behalf or as a representative of a

195
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,280
company that does industrial things uh

196
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,160
there's another side to it and that site

197
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,340
is driven by the fact that ASU most of

198
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,800
you know the life cycle of an industrial

199
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
thing whatever it is and I don't know an

200
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,740
automation line a power plant and

201
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,319
MRN scanner whatever it is a train

202
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,599
the life cycle of such a such a thing

203
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,879
it's much bigger than your usual I.T

204
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,280
life cycle so it's something that you

205
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,800
invest a lot in as a customer you live

206
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,319
with it and you take advantage of it for

207
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,839
I don't know 10 20 years in which time

208
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,339
you don't

209
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,099
usually get the chance to do any patches

210
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,320
and the guys that have been developing

211
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,240
it at the beginning are not really

212
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,039
keeping things up to date

213
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,380
and that's that's normal and the way

214
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,760
this has been approached additionally

215
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,899
was physical security nobody reaches the

216
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,240
uh the control part of our power plant

217
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,459
it's physically there separated nobody

218
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,680
gets in there only the technician that

219
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,019
knows what they are doing

220
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,779
but now also with the pandemics and with

221
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,060
the changes things are also happening in

222
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,779
that space so now many vendors of such

223
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,880
industrial devices

224
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,640
and maybe subcontractors that of that

225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,100
vendors are asking for remote access

226
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,600
and that doesn't exist because it's

227
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,760
physically separated and we end up

228
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,080
number one

229
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
with very

230
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,839
not so funny situation in which somebody

231
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,180
operating that the device is really

232
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,820
getting a DSL line from somebody from a

233
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,940
service provided and connected to that

234
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,560
in the public internet to that whatever

235
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,560
it is control part of an uh of our plant

236
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,140
and it it gets its vendor access there

237
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,180
which is not funny at all and I guess

238
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,860
many of us have seen this kind of things

239
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,180
happening

240
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,380
on the other hand all of these smart

241
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,580
devices are also triggering the

242
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,440
industrial world where everything needs

243
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,880
to be connected to the cloud these days

244
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,860
so this is scary the fact that

245
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,200
industrial devices are getting connected

246
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,820
to the cloud of the internet and access

247
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,480
from from from outside it's scary

248
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,060
and uh

249
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,660
this zero trust pillar is one of the key

250
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,459
things that we are looking in the emails

251
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,620
for the future to be the de facto

252
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,100
standard so basically uh what this means

253
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,620
is that and by the way this doesn't

254
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,080
apply just to Siemens products or to our

255
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,080
internal Network or to the way we

256
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,120
approach our customers or to our data

257
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,959
centers and so on it's supposed to be an

258
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,000
overarching strategy that applies the

259
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,680
same rules everywhere

260
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,200
and the couple

261
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,240
how do how do we do this because it's

262
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,740
it's hard to

263
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,320
if we have separate entities separate

264
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,660
rules for internal Network separables

265
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,420
for data centers rules for workers from

266
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,579
home for products towards our customers

267
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,500
it becomes complicated so the idea was

268
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,480
let's do things simpler simplify them

269
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,920
apply that never trust always verify

270
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,380
everywhere and uh

271
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,180
an interesting part

272
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,040
internet everywhere what does that mean

273
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,899
we we are turning a little bit around

274
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,519
how things are working so since

275
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,620
everybody started working from home you

276
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,240
know that initially three years ago that

277
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,160
existed that always existed working from

278
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,200
home was always a thing but it was for

279
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,420
that Lone Wolf account manager that was

280
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,420
out there somewhere in the middle of

281
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,279
nowhere and it was okay because it was

282
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,320
limited exposure these days everybody

283
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,140
works from home what they triggered in

284
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,480
many companies in many public

285
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,760
institutions was that the end devices

286
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
went hardened enough and this same zero

287
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,640
trust principles of uh of of

288
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,620
authenticating and authorizing are being

289
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,360
to an extent applied

290
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760
so then what we are trying to do and we

291
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,560
are rolling out in our locations is that

292
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,779
we turn things around and instead of

293
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,660
trying to over complicate our intranet

294
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,839
or internal Network we said that look

295
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,060
all the managed devices the laptops that

296
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,760
we are using or demons employees are

297
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,339
using they can be used from home it's

298
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,959
the last two years for a proof of that

299
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,620
so let's then turn it around and offer

300
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,140
those employees and those devices the

301
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,459
same major experience that they get at

302
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,240
home at the office which means that for

303
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,220
our employees and for the managed

304
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,140
devices basically when they come into an

305
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,880
office they get

306
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,640
the Starbucks hotspot experience of

307
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,019
course is everything that Enterprise

308
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,480
should have on top of that

309
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,040
secure internet access Cloud

310
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,779
optimization and so on and so forth but

311
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,519
at the end of the day it's the same the

312
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,180
same experience

313
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,480
but now the somehow we know this

314
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,360
the expectation from many uh the

315
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,339
expectation from

316
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,519
the majority of stakeholders was that

317
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,620
after you introduce this new thing with

318
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,600
zero trust which kind of defined rules

319
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,279
around how you how you write

320
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,740
applications how you expose them how you

321
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,540
enforce clients to access the

322
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,060
application and so on so when you do

323
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,860
this somehow there was the expectation

324
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,019
that the network would not necessarily

325
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,339
become obsolete because everything is

326
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,019
connected to everything but it will

327
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,459
become flat right everything will be

328
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,839
connected to the same wide internet

329
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,940
you'll get access to everything

330
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,380
everything will be hardened from

331
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,880
application Level because it's zero

332
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,100
trust compliant and everything is is

333
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,839
simple so

334
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,320
in all our experience I guess we learned

335
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,360
that one single tool or one single

336
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,700
architecture one single set of rules is

337
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,399
usually not the one that can solve

338
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,019
everything like in that movie

339
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,060
um so then what about the network which

340
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,500
I have been doing for uh the majority of

341
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,720
my life Network architectures and it's

342
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,200
still my hobby so the question

343
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
somehow is uh is haunting is is the

344
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,399
network stereo level because

345
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,139
all these zero transmeasures are

346
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,620
covering now everything and uh looking

347
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,480
at how traditionally network security

348
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,700
was defined we don't have a place to put

349
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,980
controls anymore not in the same way

350
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,380
that we were doing before

351
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,380
but there's a but here as long as people

352
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,620
write code well it will have bugs so

353
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,420
then all these zero trust principles if

354
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,800
you just rely on application Level

355
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
security then

356
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,480
things will happen

357
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,399
and at the same time not only that the

358
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,620
bad guys are everywhere but they have

359
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,139
connectivity towards multiple

360
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,899
destinations from multiple points and if

361
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,579
the network is flat then

362
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,699
foreign

363
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,519
server application uh hardening enough

364
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,920
I guess not so uh

365
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
I think that the network is still

366
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,980
relevant it will explore that a little

367
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,060
bit

368
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,060
there's another side of it uh so he's uh

369
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,360
as I touched on earlier these devices

370
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,120
that have a long life cycle usually

371
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,180
don't get updated very often so even if

372
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,339
you define a strategy you'll end up

373
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,139
with maybe a long development cycle

374
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,480
until you launch the next industrial

375
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,899
thing that has the capability to be zero

376
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,260
transcompliant and the written following

377
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,399
these rules

378
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,899
there's the other side of it there are

379
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,160
many vendors that are competing on

380
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,100
pricing you see those smart light bulbs

381
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,079
or maybe security cameras or stuff like

382
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,360
that those type of vendors will never

383
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,300
have the development power but indeed q

384
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,860
and day testing and all of that to make

385
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,240
sure that everything is hardened enough

386
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,240
so bottom line is that we will I guess

387
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,820
for the foreseeable future still have

388
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,639
clients and applications which are not

389
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,399
zero trust compliant so

390
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,339
how do we close all this circle so

391
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,779
Network to the rescue right

392
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,639
I really think that modern network

393
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,220
security uh adapted to these principles

394
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,320
and to this landscape is

395
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,800
is critical in this in this new world so

396
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,600
first of all

397
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,019
we should we should remember and keep in

398
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,480
place everything that exists so the

399
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,560
changes in the network security

400
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,079
architecture driven by this new zero

401
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,260
trust principles it's not about removing

402
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,579
controls we should not get rid of

403
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,920
everything that we have and make a

404
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,420
revolution it's about evolving what we

405
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,260
have

406
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,660
and there are I guess three pillars

407
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,300
three main pillars that uh I'll bring up

408
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,740
a little bit that I think are the keys

409
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,720
about the evolution of the of the

410
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,620
network

411
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,320
in this context in the zero trust world

412
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,380
so first one of it is Sassy I don't know

413
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,360
how much you have heard about it quilt

414
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,920
it back in the next slide

415
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,339
the second pillar is around how we

416
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,100
segment our networks and how we reduce

417
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,639
the attack Surface by

418
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,019
enforcing policies on this segmentation

419
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,120
and the key here is that if we do things

420
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
traditionally and I'll get back to that

421
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,019
we won't get very far

422
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,899
and the last and not least is software

423
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:04,919
defined

424
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,079
many of us have heard of soft defined

425
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,939
networks I will get back to that in a

426
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:09,740
bit

427
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,720
it this is actually the most important

428
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,339
part the most important change because

429
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,619
what it brings with it is the capability

430
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,419
to use the networks as we have them

431
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,640
today just as an underlay meaning just

432
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,500
for transporting packets and Define

433
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,959
overlays on top of that that are much

434
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,660
more Dynamic and can be better

435
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,040
controlled

436
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,960
so one by one

437
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,419
so cessie stands for secure access

438
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,120
Services Edge

439
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,059
somehow this is also a

440
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,980
I don't know if I should call it a hype

441
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,679
but it's a buzzword these days and all

442
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,140
the security vendors I think you have

443
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,780
heard of some name this killer Cisco

444
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,000
umbrella and so on Prisma access from

445
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,760
Palo Alto they are offering these

446
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,620
Solutions and they are somehow marketing

447
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,679
those as being the one thing that the

448
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,660
Enterprises or companies or public

449
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,940
sector entities need to implement

450
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,440
internet work in order to change

451
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,000
everything and become zero trust

452
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,980
compliant well it's not quite that but

453
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,380
it's a very important pillar

454
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,700
so

455
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,760
what this is what it it was sort of

456
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,280
being this new architecture it's

457
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,539
actually a new architecture for remote

458
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,460
access but it's different from what you

459
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,860
have used so far from what we we have

460
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,200
all used so far so how does remote

461
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,660
access look traditionally you have

462
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,419
somewhere an um VPN Gateway if you want

463
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,280
to call it concentrator

464
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,780
you would build from your client the

465
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,240
tunnel up to that and then it's like in

466
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,460
the traditional

467
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,660
connecting with the wire in the internet

468
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,340
you get access to everything else

469
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,620
afterwards inside so that's a

470
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,780
traditional Network approach

471
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,679
this new approach is about using

472
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,720
somehow a cloud driven front-end towards

473
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,419
your customers and you will bid an

474
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,100
application layer an application overlay

475
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,960
on top of that so you can look at this

476
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,960
as being an um if you want a smart

477
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,720
and encrypted application Level proxy in

478
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,760
which the end customers maybe employees

479
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,740
working from home or working from the

480
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,419
office and just getting internet access

481
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,419
as I as I explained earlier

482
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:16,919
they would have a client that is

483
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,360
application aware and can route

484
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,740
applications

485
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,820
with using this overlay towards

486
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,679
applications that are hosted inside of

487
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,000
the of the gates of the Enterprise

488
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,200
now

489
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,360
the

490
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,220
one of the most important new things

491
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,080
getting back to the initial picture of

492
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,120
how the New Castle looks like is

493
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
building those small red bubbles around

494
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,500
each one of the elements of the New

495
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,760
Castle

496
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,380
and how do we do that because

497
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,380
traditionally

498
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,940
how do we do Network segmentation

499
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,460
traditionally we we take the layer the

500
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,860
the lens inside locations or data center

501
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,900
you we split them in layer two domains

502
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,200
vlans we put a subnet on each one of

503
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,140
these villain and maybe we apply an

504
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,480
access list on each one of these

505
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,160
villains defining who can come in and

506
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,260
who can go out maybe we even place a

507
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,720
firewall there

508
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,059
and the new world is very very different

509
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,880
because the way it works now in the

510
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,919
networks is that whenever a device is

511
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,380
attaching to the network it first goes

512
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,780
through and so it connects to the over

513
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,780
to the underlay so exactly to the first

514
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,580
layer so before getting network access

515
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,000
that device is being authenticated maybe

516
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,620
the user using it is getting

517
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,080
authenticated there are a number of ways

518
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,780
to to to identify who is that device is

519
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,460
maybe with an agent

520
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,039
after that is being done that device is

521
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,919
being mapped to a so-called micro

522
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,720
segment so some vendors call it Security

523
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,000
Group some other call it roles

524
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,919
the idea is that

525
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,480
this is

526
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,460
a multi-site cross segments cross

527
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,900
traditional segments across subnets

528
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,620
cross vlans uh thing so one of these

529
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,419
micro segments can spread across all of

530
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,120
your sites

531
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,100
across all of your buildings in a campus

532
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,080
or across all of your floors you know

533
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,120
building and so on and so forth

534
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,160
and all of those devices in that micro

535
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,260
segment can be uniquely identified with

536
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,880
the tag with an ID it doesn't matter

537
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,039
this new ID is actually something that's

538
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,020
being transported on the overlay created

539
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,240
with software defined methods

540
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,360
and this is a very big thing it's a huge

541
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,059
thing actually because imagine that

542
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,059
you have four locations and some data

543
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,640
centers here you have HR users

544
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,799
and you have some HR applications

545
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,659
traditionally you know how it goes you

546
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,419
define the the HR users in each location

547
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,640
go to a circular subnet then you take

548
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,200
the firewall in front of the HR

549
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,700
applications you define an access list

550
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,280
there and you maintain all of that

551
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,080
what's the problem with that if you look

552
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,940
at those firewalls three four years down

553
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,880
the road you'll end up with a list of I

554
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,460
don't know 20 000 entries in an access

555
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,919
list and never nobody knows what those

556
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,200
are doing and nobody can remove them and

557
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,940
it's extremely hard to maintain on the

558
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,340
other hand when you add a new building

559
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,380
or even when you extend your

560
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,600
applications everything is complicated

561
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,220
and getting back to this micro

562
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,140
segmentation why is it such a big deal

563
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,320
because now it's called business intent

564
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
you can now actually Define in the

565
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,700
network platform in the policy

566
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,620
definition point

567
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,600
just one rule to allow for this

568
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,760
communication that says

569
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,240
HR users or HR user micro segment can

570
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,340
access HR applications micro segment

571
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,500
that's it one line

572
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,299
not only that it's extremely easy to

573
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,299
maintain it's easy to understand what it

574
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,260
does

575
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,700
and it's

576
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,500
you decouple somehow the policy

577
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,720
definition from what are the sources and

578
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,179
the destinations

579
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,340
which is actually getting us back the

580
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,140
control that we had initially with the

581
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,659
with the wall against the castle but in

582
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,179
an extremely dynamic dynamic and easy to

583
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,840
maintain way

584
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,659
now in

585
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,880
this new world what actually makes all

586
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,220
of this possible is the software-defined

587
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,860
networking which has been somehow an

588
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,020
academic thing initially so originally

589
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,580
it was thought to be something else

590
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,960
today it's the tool that allows us to

591
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,059
create overlays to make things Dynamic

592
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:30,780
and not to need to Define anymore those

593
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:35,700
static and IP based rules in the network

594
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,720
and because not everything is simple

595
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,580
there are multiple uh software defined

596
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,799
platforms different ones for different

597
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,080
for for different scopes

598
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,240
so you can have one for your campuses so

599
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,100
for where users are for what will your

600
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,640
locations are one for the data center I

601
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,820
think many of us heard of sd1 which is

602
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,280
uh standard one thing in Enterprises

603
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,080
today

604
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,480
and

605
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,880
the area is that fully for each one of

606
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,340
these domains

607
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,720
there are some rules and some things

608
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,260
that will apply so for example for the

609
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,900
campus part and production area and

610
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,740
devices iot areas as I said initially

611
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,960
we'll need to identify everything before

612
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,760
connecting to the network put them in

613
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,460
segments in micro segments and applying

614
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,380
the authorization part

615
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,000
for the uh branch and when and sd-1 part

616
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,740
it's important to do a couple of things

617
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,260
in in order to not have the users

618
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,120
complain that the water the network is

619
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,799
not working well so number one is to be

620
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,140
smarter in the way we Route traffic in

621
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,140
the network so the sd1 somehow includes

622
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,880
doing application recognition which

623
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,340
means that as a simple example when I

624
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,380
have users in my locations wanted to

625
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,840
access I don't know Office 365 I don't

626
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,220
need to put them all the way back to

627
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,900
Data Center apply their policies and

628
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,700
break them out there I can do it locally

629
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,000
directly why because I know fix 365 is a

630
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,740
software is a zero trust complaint

631
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,900
application that is already integrated

632
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,760
with my backend and I can trust that the

633
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,780
traffic can go over the Internet

634
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,700
directly it will be encrypted everything

635
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,659
will be applied the rules that I Define

636
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,020
the other thing which is important in um

637
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,659
in in the new one is that I will be able

638
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,960
to apply a different type of qas if you

639
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,159
want it won't be packet based so

640
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,380
initially the traditional Qs works

641
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,140
uh works by prioritizing something some

642
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,500
type of traffic over another in in

643
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,659
moments of congestion now with the new

644
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,480
tools that I have at my disposal with

645
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,960
sd1 I can do some some different type of

646
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,600
queries for example I have this big

647
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,480
cheap internet pipe that I only use for

648
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,820
scavenger applications like I don't know

649
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,640
employees watching YouTube

650
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,779
uh

651
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,580
commercials

652
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,279
and I have this more expensive maybe an

653
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,559
mpls pipe where I wrote my my critical

654
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,360
applications and the nice part is that

655
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,880
using Central orchestration I can do

656
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,960
things like

657
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,779
if all of a sudden YouTube it becomes a

658
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:19,980
business critical application because

659
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,799
maybe I have the trainings on it I will

660
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,480
be able to just

661
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,880
with a couple of clicks Define look the

662
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,559
YouTube traffic now it's not scavenger

663
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,419
move it to the more important link so

664
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,400
everybody is happier including the one

665
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,960
that wanted to do training on YouTube

666
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,840
so since we I only had two more minutes

667
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,940
I'll end with a

668
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,380
whoops

669
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,140
on button with a thank you

670
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,200
and if any questions please thank you

671
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,120
very much we have a question

672
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,200
hi so uh first of all I just want to say

673
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,380
that your passion really comes through

674
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,919
thank you a really great talk

675
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,559
as you mentioned the the landscape is

676
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,480
fundamentally changing and with that the

677
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,380
role of a network engineer is

678
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,360
definitely changing right we're moving

679
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,520
from one model to another what would you

680
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,250
say are

681
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,580
[Music]

682
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,159
individual contributor level skills that

683
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:25,380
people should focus on as we move from

684
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,960
the the way we used to do things to the

685
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,360
new way that we're apparently going to

686
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,880
do things thank you thank you very good

687
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,980
question because actually it's even more

688
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,720
complicated than that it's not gender

689
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,120
internal users at the same time there's

690
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,100
this big move to where it's Outsourcing

691
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,140
of all i t and of all networking so

692
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,240
things happen in parallel and usually

693
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,799
the service provider is taking it over

694
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,840
are not really much more equipped than

695
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,700
the users inside but just to answer your

696
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,580
questions I think that the

697
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,440
main new point that the network engineer

698
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,360
should take in is to understand the new

699
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,860
technologies that are around software

700
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,539
defined things and the reason for that

701
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,419
is that it's fundamentally different so

702
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,760
you would say an entry-level Junior

703
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,220
engineer initially if you go and tell

704
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,860
them look you need to change this 1000

705
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,080
side QRS mapping they all said it will

706
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,299
take half a year I'll do it Hand by hand

707
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,980
on which one of them plan the changes

708
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,460
and so on maybe a more senior one would

709
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,140
think about scripting and doing some

710
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,700
sort of a hand

711
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,100
little application but with this in

712
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,720
these days if you get it right from an

713
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,279
architecture perspective

714
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,020
and you couple all these

715
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,820
software-defined walls together you can

716
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,600
actually do changes in just a in just

717
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,460
with just couple of clicks

718
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,279
you know I'm I'm not praising the GUI

719
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,880
and get lit of CLI because

720
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,980
we should also have employees and know

721
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,260
how how things are going but when it

722
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,360
comes to how to apply changes and also

723
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,919
how to apply security from that

724
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,559
perspective things are much easier and

725
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,480
much more Dynamic and much simpler with

726
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,460
the software defined platforms and some

727
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,080
of them are more mature than others so

728
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,400
for example I think that software

729
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,559
defined when is at

730
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,960
about there with the maturity

731
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,480
Data Center Software defined networking

732
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,779
is in its Bloom somehow while with the

733
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,580
campus part we are still at the

734
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,100
beginning but in terms of fundamental

735
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,440
shifting in in how Network Engineers

736
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,399
think

737
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,679
understanding these new things is key

738
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,200
and how to use them because it

739
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,539
there's another challenge to it usually

740
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,960
Network Engineers are very afraid at

741
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,299
least the I would say the more

742
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:34,980
experienced one are very afraid of these

743
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,720
platforms when you do three clicks and

744
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,520
it changes everything in your network

745
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,380
and they should learn to live with that

746
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,840
because it's how we need to do things in

747
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,679
the future

748
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,080
but thank you nice question

749
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,240
thank you very much I I can see another

750
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,539
question

751
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,299
point of view of security not commercial

752
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:57,320
do you think that is better well that

753
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,840
the network equipment producer to make

754
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,559
updates on firmware software many years

755
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,760
not only five years three years

756
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,260
yeah I think things

757
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,620
a lot of configuration a lot of you know

758
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,580
yes so just to play it back to make sure

759
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,260
that's correctly you're asking about the

760
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,120
level of support and the updates that

761
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,500
the network vendors are keeping for

762
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,399
their equipment correct

763
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,760
so basically it it depends because uh

764
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,500
some equipments have a longer life cycle

765
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,080
than others however I think what's

766
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,640
extremely important there apart from

767
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,380
what the network vendors are doing

768
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,539
because we we have limited leverages

769
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:45,059
with them I think it's very important to

770
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,960
maintain healthy processes and healthy

771
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,220
rules and way of approaching things

772
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,980
inside companies inside public sector

773
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,140
inside Enterprises and things like

774
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,940
making sure you don't have equipment

775
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,220
that's end of support and nobody does

776
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,740
patches for it anymore it's very

777
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,779
important so I would say yes of course

778
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,580
the network vendor should do much more

779
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,159
for us because we are paying them

780
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,799
large amounts of money everybody knows

781
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,059
that but there's also I I firmly believe

782
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:17,100
that we should also look at ourselves

783
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,260
and see what we can do better and what's

784
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,940
easier to do

785
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,399
and keeping healthy rules about how we

786
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,500
maintain software how many team pages

787
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,679
How We Do patching how we keep equipment

788
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,320
in support is

789
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,399
even more important

790
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,919
I

791
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,940
we are not good so good and make a

792
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,179
worse configuration and for important of

793
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,880
your security is not good

794
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,460
no it's not and uh these things will

795
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,200
always happen I think that at a certain

796
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,179
extent this new software-defined world

797
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,919
will help because as long as you

798
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,860
decouple this Sunderland overlay

799
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,840
you should be safe because the overlay

800
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,700
part the security part that is actually

801
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,279
user facing or application facing is now

802
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,020
moved to something that's automated and

803
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,059
orchestrated and usually the engineers

804
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,220
are just creating the underlay which

805
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,360
exposes

806
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,600
less from a security perspective

807
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,179
but you're right so things can be

808
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,580
improved there

809
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,159
thank you very much for the questions

810
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,399
I guess I have we have time only for one

811
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:45,000
more question one more short if possible

812
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,940
how do you mitigate the identities on

813
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,440
something

814
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,380
sorry how do you mitigate if a user

815
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,840
password is leaked

816
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,480
if a user password is stolen that's the

817
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,539
question right okay uh I won't go to MFA

818
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:03,240
because that's the obvious uh answer to

819
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,860
that so the the key there is to define

820
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,659
the policies and the way to map

821
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:11,880
endpoints to micro segments not just

822
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,860
user based so usually there's a

823
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,240
combination you need to authenticate the

824
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,019
device via certificate somehow then you

825
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,059
authenticate the user there is way of

826
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,380
doing that to the ways of doing that

827
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,899
today with yep chaining and so on and on

828
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,580
top of that you also look at the posture

829
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,140
of that device meaning it has the right

830
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,760
level of patches and the virus and so on

831
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,380
you're just decreasing the risk

832
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,200
obviously everybody will be able to

833
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,260
store passwords as we have heard earlier

834
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,399
today

835
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,519
and apart from mitigating how you

836
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,380
authenticate that device there's also

837
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,240
the key factor that is these new micro

838
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,480
segments new segmentation way is really

839
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,159
decreasing the a lot of the attack

840
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,200
surface so even if a credential the

841
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,899
principle is even assumed Bridge you

842
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,760
know from my second slide assuming

843
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,919
having bristles then you have

844
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,260
such a small attack surface that usually

845
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,019
you'll just get devices of the same

846
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:07,740
security sensitivity exposed after you

847
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,300
get such a breach

848
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,418
but as with security you can never be

849
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,440
100 safe

850
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,540
will still be available in the lobby yes

851
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,599
additional questions and now we can move

852
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,100
for the thank you very much

853
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:34,020
[Applause]
