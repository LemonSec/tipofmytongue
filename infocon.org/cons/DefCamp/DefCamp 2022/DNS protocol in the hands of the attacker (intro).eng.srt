1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
my name is cosmin I'm the decoy here

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,120
because I'm the salesman and this being

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,460
a technical presentation I'm pretty sure

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,500
you are I am not the guide you want to

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,559
see in the on the stage but again I'm

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,440
just a decoy I'm here to introduce Yan

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,300
but before introducing Jana I want to

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,859
introduce infoblox

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,640
for the ones that weren't here

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,039
three years ago by the way how many of

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,840
you attended to the 2019 event

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,800
not too many hands we did had a

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,620
presentation in 2019 but it was held by

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,020
our colleague pioter from Poland

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,420
but because Peter was a good guy he is

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,899
now in Hawaii

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,460
he sold too much

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,480
now

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,440
infoblox infoblox is the leader in

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,239
Secure DNS

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,620
do you know what DNS is

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,640
that a good start I'm pretty sure

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,979
everybody knows what DNS is well let me

24
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,479
give you a harder question do you know

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,040
the difference between DNS and active

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,460
directory

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,080
okay

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,299
now Gardner is saying that we are the

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,860
market leader in Secure DNS we are

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,500
covering more than 50 percent of all DNS

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,100
uh business all around the world where

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,560
uh an Enterprise company we are selling

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,420
our solutions to Enterprise customers

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,619
but again

35
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,479
that's not the reason you are here the

36
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,240
reason you are here is to listen to Jan

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,860
to

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,020
foreign to give us some examples of what

39
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,780
is happening on the DNS security part

40
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,360
because we want to interact with you and

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,159
I know it's the last presentation it was

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,500
almost six o'clock we do have some hats

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,299
over there they're not as cool as the

44
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,020
black has that some of us got but their

45
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,259
heads so if Yan is having a question and

46
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,700
you want to answer

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,140
the first

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,060
six seven of you will get a cool hat

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,159
with infoblox thank you so much let's

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,119
give a cheer to Jan
