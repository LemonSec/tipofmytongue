1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
uh hello so I'm Monica bojano I'm the

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,040
startup programs manager for orange

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,780
Romania I know I have the odd talk in

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,880
the in the whole conference I guess it's

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,920
a bit of a different subject but uh I'm

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,800
hoping that you cyber security uh

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,800
passionates uh will consider Building

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,260
Products this is what my talk is about

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,600
we're going to go into a bit of Basics

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,359
around this and I hope you get inspired

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,480
and you make the step towards this thing

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,380
first of all why am I here and why am I

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,460
representing orange Romania and

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,440
discussing about entrepreneurship and

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,239
building startups

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:39,840
um

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,020
for orange Romania we are running an

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,300
acceleration program for startups we've

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,520
been running it in Romania for the past

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,879
five years since 2017. we've worked with

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,219
eight cyber security startups from

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,800
Romania in this program already and I

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,899
hope there will be many many more coming

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,600
in the further years uh this is why I'm

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,980
here

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,220
um what we did so just to show that we

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,400
put our money where our words are we

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,700
have bought and we have resold products

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,460
from startups we have paid to Romanian

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,799
startups in the past five years 2.2

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
million euros and out of these

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,320
808 actually have 808 thousand uh went

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,780
to towards the security startups in

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,659
Romania in our program

35
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,020
so we are involved in this if anyone is

36
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,180
thinking about making the step I assure

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,100
you that there's a lot of support in the

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,560
in the community from Orange and from

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,079
all directors as well

40
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,420
a bit about myself and thank you for the

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,939
nice introduction I graduated computer

42
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,960
science a while ago I worked in

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,360
different environments I worked in the

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,579
I.T Department of University of the

45
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,040
university in sibio I've worked in

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,159
startups both in Romanian startups and

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,159
in an international one I've worked in

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,979
spin-offs Espino from which is kind of a

49
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,538
startup but it comes from a bigger

50
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,420
company and has a bit of extra resources

51
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,599
and now I work in a corporation I also

52
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,660
worked in various other medium sized

53
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,120
companies to say

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,280
what I did I worked as a software tester

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,780
I worked as a technical support I

56
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,959
managed a lot of startup programs and

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,760
I've worked as a product manager this is

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,099
why I'm here then this is what kind of

59
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,620
brings me close to the subject who are

60
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,660
you

61
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,280
is anyone in the audience willing to

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,500
share why they are here to listen to

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,720
this talk

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,400
otherwise I'm going to tell you my

65
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,080
assumptions but they might not prove

66
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,580
true right

67
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,599
why are you here

68
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,620
okay so I'm guessing and this is why I

69
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,780
did this talk like this that you are

70
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,700
passionate about cyber security most

71
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,160
probably you are technical persons uh

72
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,200
you either work for companies in the

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,300
security field or you're maybe doing

74
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,400
consultancy and you're offering your

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,500
services to other people maybe your

76
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,879
students and you're passionate about

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,700
this subject and I congratulate you for

78
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,260
being here

79
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,640
so when it comes to building products

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,680
they say that products are kind of an

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,599
intersection of these things right of

82
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,640
technology which you have to really

83
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
understand in order to be able to bring

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,560
new products to Market of customers of

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,900
users and of the problems that they face

86
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,060
and usually when people start building

87
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,519
products they start with one of these

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,400
areas in mind either they are very good

89
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,019
at the technology and they're doing some

90
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,879
research in that area and they discover

91
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,580
some algorithms that can be used to

92
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,680
automate some things that they currently

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,959
do manual I don't know you you have

94
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,700
something here and you think you can

95
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,440
build a product around that technology

96
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,019
right your Maybe

97
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,140
have have some potential users in mind

98
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,060
either I don't know you're a security

99
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,239
guy you have some pains and you think of

100
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,000
a product that might help you uh uh

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,220
solve those problems right so you either

102
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,459
start maybe you want to build stuff to

103
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,440
enable security people to do their job

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,019
better so you you kind of start with one

105
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,600
of these three aspects right usually the

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,160
technical people start with the

107
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,560
technology in mind right you you do you

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,419
build some algorithms and then you say

109
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,880
now I really wanna I wanna sell these

110
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,520
and why do you want to sell these

111
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,600
in Romania usually it's kind of a it's

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,120
not good to make money right it's weird

113
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,919
to want to make money out of what I'm

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,500
doing or I'm used to being paid for my

115
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
services for my time but when I kind of

116
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,139
try to aim higher it's it's not

117
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,560
comfortable but what I want to encourage

118
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,960
you is to view the fact that you are

119
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,180
doing something that can be solved on a

120
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,360
salt on a large scale as having a bigger

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,440
impact

122
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,500
because if you do Services there's only

123
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,780
so much time in a day that you can offer

124
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,940
those Security Services for your clients

125
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,280
right if you manage to automate some

126
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,680
something of this and that can be solved

127
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,620
later on and used by a lot of people

128
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,440
that builds way bigger impact than you

129
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,240
can have by yourself

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,000
and the money that you make out of this

131
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,160
is a great way to measure this impact

132
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,320
that you're having right

133
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,580
so

134
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,620
people start with the technology and I

135
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,199
uh this is my assumption that this is

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,199
the audience so what I saw that

137
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,840
technical people uh make as a first

138
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,840
mistake is building those algorithms and

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,840
thinking that they've sold the the that

140
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,580
they've created the product and they try

141
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,500
to sell it to other people right

142
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,800
that is true what do you think

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,840
nope

144
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,360
so what what does it mean to actually

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,220
create a product around the technology

146
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,320
right

147
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,720
[Music]

148
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,800
um

149
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,800
you have to clearly identify the problem

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,340
or the need that you are addressing and

151
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,680
without this it's a research paper

152
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,759
without this is invention right

153
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,580
Innovation is invention times

154
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,139
commercialization so if you don't sell

155
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,360
that if you don't manage to put a price

156
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,580
on it and to see people that are buying

157
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,979
it you don't have a product you have

158
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,080
research you have invention you have

159
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,300
something interesting but there's a lot

160
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,000
more to think about when it comes to

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,280
really identifying the important problem

162
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,280
that it can solve and with it's it's

163
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,400
normal to do this there's a process that

164
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,620
you can take to towards you know

165
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,600
brainstorming and then choosing what

166
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,720
your algorithms can solve right and how

167
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,539
do you do this you talk to people so

168
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,940
this problem that you're solving has to

169
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,479
to address some type of customers

170
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,840
now customers or users and they're not

171
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,699
always the same

172
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,740
um you need to understand them and they

173
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,020
can be very differently served to say

174
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,660
and I noticed this yesterday when I came

175
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,699
to see the room and I'm very happy about

176
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,380
the fact that we have this Gap here

177
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,539
because I want to tell you about user

178
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,940
experience

179
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,479
this Gap here if I wouldn't have this

180
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,360
mic if I'd have a handheld mic and I'm a

181
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,340
nervous Walker and I like to walk around

182
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,380
the stage okay this

183
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,160
that's a problem for me right

184
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,440
but if I'm here

185
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,900
to do a live coding session and I need

186
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,840
to have my laptop here that I don't even

187
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,539
notice it so not only that it's not a

188
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,639
problem I don't see it

189
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,860
for the organizer who maybe wants to

190
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,020
take photos of me for you the audience

191
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,979
who maybe will be

192
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,720
won't see the presentation as well if I

193
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,000
walk around there it's actually a useful

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,580
constru constraint the fact that I

195
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,880
cannot walk around there right so this

196
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,220
is one thing but for different types of

197
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,940
people it represents something else

198
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,340
maybe if the organizer is really

199
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,440
interested in me not going there because

200
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,940
if I had the head and health mic

201
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,219
they told me to speak into the mic so I

202
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,339
wouldn't do that I promise last time so

203
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,979
if I go and I walk lower that's a path

204
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,219
that me as a user I might take right and

205
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,320
you maybe would discover this when you

206
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,240
do some user testing if you do that

207
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
right and you stand over the shoulder of

208
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,740
your users before releasing the product

209
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,600
and you notice that they take that

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
pattern you say I don't want them to do

211
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,740
that if you're the conference organizer

212
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,899
maybe you build a fence here and you say

213
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,540
no way you're going to go there right so

214
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,779
this is something that I put it here you

215
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,519
see customer you say you think about the

216
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,980
customers and it seems easy but in fact

217
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,800
if you really want to do this right and

218
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,040
that's how you build worldwide products

219
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,680
by doing each little aspect of your

220
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,899
product right is something that you need

221
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,540
to really think about and you need to

222
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,480
experiment so you will try stuff you'll

223
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,040
see how people interact with your

224
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,260
product and then you'll decide to change

225
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,240
things or to keep things as you've

226
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,279
thought of them

227
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,200
as I was saying you have to sell this

228
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,680
product and again this is not easy you

229
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,480
can sell your product in different

230
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,760
channels and you can put different

231
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,279
prices on your products and if you do

232
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,980
this again to do it right you think you

233
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,140
have to really think about strategy here

234
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,500
so you can put a price on your time

235
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,720
that's what you do when you are offering

236
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
cyber security services probably right

237
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,399
there's it takes me some time I will

238
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,620
come into your company I will help you

239
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,180
with this it's going to take me two or

240
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,500
three days and it's going to cost you

241
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,399
this

242
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,160
you can look at it the other way on the

243
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,140
benefit that you are bringing to your

244
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,600
customer and you say what is the risk

245
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,160
that they have if they don't employ my

246
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,519
product how much money can they lose and

247
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,560
what percentage of that does it make

248
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,140
sense for them to pay me to avoid losing

249
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,459
that right

250
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:27,240
now again it's really different if you

251
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,880
serve uh large Enterprises you can put

252
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,100
higher prices on that because there's a

253
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,620
lot of other stuff

254
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,820
for the product that you need to build

255
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,320
or uh if you're doing a b2c so the end

256
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,240
customers a consumer product you're

257
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,600
probably going to price that lower but

258
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,519
you're going to count on larger amounts

259
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,560
right if you build it you give it to

260
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,660
millions of customers ideally

261
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,440
sales channels again uh you can I don't

262
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,060
know do you remember the times when we

263
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,440
used to buy anti-virus licenses on CDs

264
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,540
yeah so you you went to the store and

265
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,579
you picked up your antivirus license

266
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,920
that was the sales Channel that's that's

267
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
what you did it back then it was kind of

268
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,740
retail now you don't do that now you uh

269
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,380
either I think we went to buying that

270
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,959
online right but it still usually was a

271
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,940
lifetime license and then we started

272
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,740
going into the model of paying it

273
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,079
monthly if you want to stop paying it

274
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,740
last next month maybe you find a newer

275
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,980
more efficient antivirus you stop paying

276
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,100
me and then you you take a

277
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,140
you make what what what's best for you

278
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,420
so again all this think about it uh and

279
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,300
it's not easy now let's say you did all

280
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,040
that right

281
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,660
um You have to offer technical support

282
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,240
and that again if you if you have a good

283
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,579
product that should not take you too

284
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,920
much if you have a bad product you're

285
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,839
gonna have to put more people into

286
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,360
technical support and they're gonna come

287
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,000
back with bugs and problems from the

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,279
users and then you need to keep

289
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,899
improving the product

290
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,860
so in time maybe you so again this these

291
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,019
are aspects that you need to take into

292
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,779
consideration and without these you do

293
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,180
not have a product without these again

294
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,459
you have a technology you have high

295
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,700
potential and when it comes to invest

296
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,120
investors uh giving money to startups

297
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,800
Sometimes They Bet On Your Potential

298
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,480
right but once you have at least a

299
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,459
decent amount of all these things

300
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,380
figured out and you have some paying

301
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,820
customers and it looks like you're

302
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,399
growing and you might go that's when you

303
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,779
have a product and that's when you're

304
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,180
scaling up until then you're building

305
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,720
minimum viable products right

306
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,740
um

307
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,980
and and that's how it goes

308
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,500
I said that that's not easy to do and

309
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,899
for sure it's not for one person to do

310
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,839
it but there's a lot of Frameworks that

311
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,940
you can use to figure out those things

312
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll just show you two of them because I

313
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,680
can teach you to how to build a product

314
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,279
in 30 minutes uh but you can read books

315
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,360
and I I have a slide on that so this uh

316
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,160
this is a framework that was developed

317
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,459
by uh Bill olet who's the director of

318
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,440
the Martin trust for entrepreneurship

319
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,380
Center at MIT so it's built for

320
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,300
technical people so I encourage you to

321
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,660
to look into this it's a thorough book

322
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,839
and it's a completed by a workbook

323
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,339
and this takes you to some steps not few

324
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:43,500
into figuring out how how you can build

325
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,899
this company and how it can go well you

326
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,120
won't do this in a in a day or in a

327
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,760
month you will do it iteratively by

328
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,579
building stuff testing it seeing how the

329
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,579
market responds to it and then adjusting

330
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,220
this is why it's putting uh Snakes and

331
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,860
Ladders type of game because it's not

332
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,500
linear so you make assumptions like I

333
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,579
did maybe in the middle of this talk I

334
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,620
stop and I insist on you answering my

335
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,800
question of why are you here and I

336
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,720
discovered that the talk is not well

337
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,880
thought out and then I have to iterate

338
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,040
right so this is what you're going to do

339
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,160
here you try to figure out who is your

340
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,800
customer then what you can do for your

341
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,720
customer and

342
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,000
along the way you will kind of

343
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,639
brainstorm into potential people who

344
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,440
might use your product you'll make

345
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,380
choices you'll go down One path then

346
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,720
you'll test if your assumptions were

347
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,880
right and you might be proven right

348
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,220
which is great and then you move on but

349
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,199
you can find a letter that brings you

350
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,300
back and it says no that assumption did

351
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,160
not work those people aren't willing to

352
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,260
buy your product like it is you have to

353
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,779
go back some steps and rethink what

354
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,260
you've already built okay again we won't

355
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,839
go into detail so let's just read the

356
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,480
steps so it's about who is your customer

357
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,339
and understanding those types of people

358
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,160
what you can do for your customer

359
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,380
how does your customer acquire the

360
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,720
product that's the sales channels that I

361
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,339
was saying how do you make money off

362
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,920
your product and that's uh pricing and

363
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,320
everything the business model

364
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,820
um how do you design and build your

365
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,620
product right and that's a lot of the

366
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,320
MVP that I was saying there and how do

367
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,019
you scale your business so you you may

368
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,639
figure out how to sell to Romanian

369
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,440
people and when you try to go to

370
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,360
different markets that doesn't work

371
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,339
right and that's that's about scaling

372
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,139
and figuring out how to grow

373
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,720
um it's this solves part of the problem

374
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,720
but it's more uh known maybe to answer

375
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,120
maybe to entrepreneurs and a bit easier

376
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,699
to go to to figuring out your business

377
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,680
model so

378
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,779
why does this work oh yeah okay so this

379
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,760
takes you into the value propositions

380
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,740
which is what the product is and what it

381
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,779
does for the customers right the

382
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,519
customer segments again who are the

383
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,740
people the customer relationships that

384
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,139
you have to address these segments and

385
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,180
the channels you have to reach them who

386
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,920
are the partners maybe you partner with

387
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,380
some retailers or I don't know other

388
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,820
people who have

389
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,220
similar products to yours that can take

390
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,500
you to some customers the Key activities

391
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,480
and resources that you need in order to

392
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,339
actually build a product the cost

393
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,139
structure and the revenue streams again

394
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:29,899
how you take money from these people

395
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:32,820
this is these are Frameworks and this is

396
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,000
also described in a big book that you

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,880
can use and you can talk to your team uh

398
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,279
on on what the assumptions are how you

399
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,920
are thinking of developing your product

400
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,540
and

401
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,360
starting to do it iteratively

402
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,660
now do you read books

403
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,680
who here is still reading books

404
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,180
okay great

405
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,720
um

406
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,139
wonderful audience for me if you I'm

407
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,880
sure that you can go to Corsair and

408
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,740
udemy and find some courses on each of

409
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,140
these topics uh maybe some of them even

410
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,119
helped by by the guys that wrote the

411
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,000
books but I I love reading books and I

412
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,260
think that it's great that you can

413
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,439
always come back to them and these I I

414
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,079
suggest you take in in physical hard

415
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,419
copies right

416
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:23,220
so disciplined entrepreneurship is the

417
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,919
book by Bill olet who did the snakes and

418
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,419
letters steps uh wonderful book and then

419
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:33,240
you can let me check on I have time good

420
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
business model generation is the

421
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,380
business model that I uh showed you the

422
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,160
framework value proposition design is

423
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,120
strictly for

424
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,600
for this part

425
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,940
so this it looks

426
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,059
a small thing right this and how you

427
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,980
actually think of the value proposition

428
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,320
is developed in one book again it

429
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,660
depends on how much you do your homework

430
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,940
and how well you want to think each

431
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,700
aspect of your business so it's about

432
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
thinking if for example if your product

433
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,100
is nice to have for the customers like

434
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,500
Facebook is for example Instagram we can

435
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,020
live without it or if it's a painkiller

436
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,820
right if you cannot live without

437
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,039
something we cannot live maybe without

438
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,080
our mobile phones right now

439
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,960
or maybe we can but that's a question

440
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,299
that you want to have and that's going

441
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,760
to influence how you think of things how

442
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,260
you put the pricing on if you're

443
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,000
building a painkiller for somebody but

444
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,980
maybe you can price it higher than if

445
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,740
you if you build a vitamin

446
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,900
for example then there's a startup

447
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,940
owner's manual which was written by

448
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,059
Steve blank it's startup Owner's Manual

449
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,919
of 600 pages

450
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,080
another framework so these are kind of

451
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,600
Alternatives of thinking of things the

452
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,700
Design of Everyday Things talks about

453
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,460
physical products mostly but IT

454
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,120
addresses a lot into uh online and

455
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,480
software products it's gonna help you to

456
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,720
think of this when when you I don't know

457
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,700
there's there's this car did you take

458
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,059
the bolt that has the handle here

459
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,280
I I've noticed this so it's some people

460
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,380
who have designed this card

461
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,700
have thought that it's really

462
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,140
interesting to put the handle here

463
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,240
instead of here where we're all used to

464
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,700
it right and what is going on people

465
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,919
don't find the handle I I've noticed

466
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,200
both cars that have stickers like press

467
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,360
here so why would you do that that's

468
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,820
nice for design Maisie baby you want to

469
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,559
do something different but is it really

470
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,179
useful because you have to take into

471
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,380
account that the people are really

472
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,200
accustomed to opening a door somewhere

473
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,960
okay so maybe some wheels are best not

474
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,700
reinvented

475
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,299
great book uh the mom test will teach

476
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,000
you how to do customer surveys so the

477
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,160
idea is that usually if you ask your mom

478
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,620
that about what you're building if she

479
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,960
likes it she'll try to encourage you but

480
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,600
if you ask the questions rightly she

481
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,580
might she will not have the opportunity

482
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,860
to do so so you have to when you're

483
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,539
doing customer service and you're trying

484
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,820
to understand about your customers you

485
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,820
have to ask about their experience not

486
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,620
about what would they do

487
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,919
so you it's a book on creating surveys

488
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,380
and on having these types of interviews

489
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,200
a networking book by Paul Renault is for

490
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,880
anyone who's coming to this type of

491
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,000
conferences to do some business so it's

492
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,760
uh general for for the business

493
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,520
environment I think zero to one by Peter

494
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,419
Thiel

495
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,080
he was in bran you know the so that's

496
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,799
the guy uh he's uh Elon Musk didn't come

497
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,860
but Peter Thiel was here and he's quite

498
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,440
a big deal he wrote this book on reading

499
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,240
on on really inventing things that go

500
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,539
from zero from something that is not uh

501
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:54,299
it does not exist in the world to one

502
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:57,360
which is something a lot of the people a

503
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,820
lot of the products are solving uh

504
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,640
problems iteratively so you do something

505
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,860
better than the tools that they are that

506
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,440
are out there but maybe you can go from

507
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,320
zero to one with a security product that

508
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,360
pinpoints something and maybe automate

509
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,460
it automates it like it's never been

510
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,020
done before

511
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,020
and there's this is a talk about also

512
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,820
how investors evaluate these types of

513
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,280
disruptive startups again interested

514
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,860
inspired for product managers the hard

515
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,440
thing about the hard things is uh really

516
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,020
the story of uh Ben Horowitz building

517
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,960
different types of companies uh and shoe

518
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,840
dog I really like it and it's

519
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,039
autobiography from the founder of Nike

520
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,340
so it's it's just nice to read but it's

521
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,320
really inspiring when it comes to the

522
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,120
entrepreneurial mindset

523
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,039
and you can be entrepreneurial don't

524
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,679
mistake me by being an employee in a

525
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,919
company yeah companies

526
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,620
are building new products every day and

527
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,380
a lot of the times these products start

528
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,720
as ideas from some employees who raise

529
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,460
their hands and say I think we can do

530
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,039
this more productively I think we can do

531
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,799
this and they managed to to get

532
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,780
resources from that company and they can

533
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,460
start an entrepreneurial team that's

534
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,640
entrepreneurial right so you can do that

535
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,500
don't be constrained by where you are

536
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,159
and maybe the fact that you wanna

537
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,900
make sure you have a monthly salary to

538
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,919
keep your family safe right but you can

539
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,080
also have the entrepreneurial mindset

540
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,280
and really go after it on your own

541
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,200
and that on your own

542
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,500
is incorrect you will never be able to

543
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,900
really build a valuable product by

544
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,159
yourself

545
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,299
few people have managed to do one solo

546
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,860
founder companies

547
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,200
and even these people

548
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,480
rely on strong teams

549
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,299
so you have to have strong teams I told

550
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,640
you about all these different aspects of

551
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,200
the company that you need to take into

552
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,360
consideration and you can tell that

553
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,980
there's a lot of work to be put in there

554
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,679
some people who are very analytical are

555
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,960
good at one part some people who are

556
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,360
nice to talk to people are very good at

557
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
other parts some have to be creative

558
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,980
some have to be very organized and we

559
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,659
didn't talk about financials and stuff

560
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,720
and we're legal right you know legal is

561
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,820
is a big thing to take into

562
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,640
consideration information security so

563
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,440
build strong teams if you want to create

564
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,640
products there's no way other than that

565
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,419
and lastly share the journey which means

566
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,640
talk to other people who are working a

567
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,840
similar path

568
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,059
and these are some examples of the

569
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,919
startups that we're working with in the

570
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,440
orange Fab acceleration program these

571
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
are startups that are around here Arcana

572
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,659
AI Core anti-virus the Guinness in stage

573
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,580
one you can meet them in the Expo area

574
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,039
at our orange booth

575
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,140
pen test tools they have their own boots

576
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,059
there's their sponsors for this

577
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:00,780
conference they have grown wonderfully

578
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,240
during the past years and they're great

579
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,159
people and I'm really happy to see them

580
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,799
kind of giving back to the community

581
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,840
yeah they're I know ADI Fortuna is also

582
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,600
a speaker for many conferences so these

583
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,179
people and cyboredo the guys in the

584
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,100
hacking Village use this platform too

585
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,780
for for the capture the flag contest

586
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,360
again these are people who are good at

587
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,120
cyber security like most of you are I

588
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,900
guess

589
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,020
and they are building stuff they figured

590
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,360
out some parts they're probably most

591
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,220
probably still figuring out some other

592
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,600
stuff some are trying to raise

593
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,240
investment rounds some are trying to

594
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,580
scale their business worldwide

595
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,600
but I'm sure and this is my advice to

596
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,460
you to go to talk to them if you have an

597
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,559
idea people are usually too busy

598
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,419
building their own ideas to steal yours

599
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,419
I hope the days of having that fear are

600
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,200
gone

601
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,840
and even if you have that idea execution

602
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,679
is what really makes it or breaks it

603
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,140
so talk to these people uh get inspired

604
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,659
share your struggles learn from their

605
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,760
mistakes so you don't have to repeat

606
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,320
them

607
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,760
um and good luck building a product

608
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,679
that's

609
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,140
that's me and I'm right on time thank

610
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,240
you if you have any questions three

611
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,020
minutes right

612
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
thank you I wanted to ask you in your

613
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,840
experience uh what is the best way to

614
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,580
tell technical people that their the

615
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,919
features that might suggest even though

616
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,380
they are revolutionary aren't the best

617
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,159
fit for the market to Target right now

618
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,380
so my advice would be not to tell them

619
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,860
but to show them uh what we did when I

620
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,740
worked in the in one of the companies uh

621
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,039
everyone learned to do user tests so you

622
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,200
can build a prototype like the most

623
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,840
basic prototype of what your idea is and

624
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,020
that can be even a napkin sketch right

625
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,080
and show it to some people so these are

626
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,640
the potential customers these are the

627
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,100
people we want to address go out and

628
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,640
speak to one two five ten and when you

629
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,980
get that experience of discussing about

630
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,380
the feature that you have in mind with

631
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,960
the end people you will get the feedback

632
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,539
yourself so this way the way you show

633
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,900
them otherwise it depends on the

634
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,760
personality types that you have and I

635
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,500
said build strong teams you have to also

636
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,279
manage those from strong teams right

637
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,919
you either create really clearly thought

638
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,799
out paths and if you're Technical and

639
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,840
you're super good technically if you

640
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,340
want to be part of this team and you

641
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,900
don't want to do the user tests for

642
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,659
example uh you have to stick to your

643
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,220
part but you have to listen to the

644
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,860
people who do that so you either learn

645
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,659
to do it a bit about yourself and see

646
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,900
for yourself what I'm telling you about

647
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,520
or you need to trust the people around

648
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,059
you and that's important so teams are

649
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,919
built around Trust

650
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,140
thank you I'm a middleman between the PM

651
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,880
and the technical team so this is very

652
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,320
helpful thank you thank you

653
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,080
hi awesome talk thank you I wanted to

654
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,539
ask you what are some of the most common

655
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,940
mistakes that you have seen startups do

656
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,799
maybe in the process of defining that

657
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,500
users or even in the technical process

658
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,460
so it's General uh answer but it's not

659
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,159
testing their assumptions so you you

660
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,440
know mindfulness and things like this

661
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,200
you need to be aware of where you are

662
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,480
assuming stuff and where you really know

663
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,059
stuff that you tested yeah and that you

664
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:57,059
validate it and you you tend to go on

665
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,080
those Snakes and Ladders

666
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,400
when you're doing the snakes and letters

667
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,059
you tend to move a lot of bases in front

668
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,980
and you don't realize that one

669
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,960
assumption is wrong and then you've

670
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,820
wasted a lot of time and a lot of

671
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,279
resources into building something that

672
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,840
you should have realized way earlier

673
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,779
that was wrong

674
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:22,700
General otherwise a lot

675
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,059
yes

676
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,159
okay what was the idea behind Panthers

677
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,299
tools

678
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,960
oh you have to just go into

679
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,760
go and talk to the guys I don't want to

680
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,640
be their advocate so they started

681
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,220
building pen testing automating pen

682
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,360
testing

683
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,240
uh was there any

684
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,980
initial problem that needed to be solved

685
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,340
specifically yeah I don't know that

686
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,500
team so you find them in the Expo area

687
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,779
they have a booth and I'm sure you can

688
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,760
find ADI Fortuna who is the founder of

689
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,039
that and ask him how how he started the

690
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,000
company
