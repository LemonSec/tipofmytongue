1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
let me introduce myself my name is

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,020
venzel

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,139
I came from Budapest actually and I came

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,860
with some nostalgic feelings because six

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,660
years ago

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,900
I spent a week per month in Bucharest

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,080
and now I have a chance also to meet old

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,539
friends in Bucharest also I could

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,060
realize that there are a few things

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,980
which do not change in Bucharest like

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,380
the traffic

12
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,260
but this this conference is a great

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,840
opportunity also to share my thoughts

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,500
about 5G security and the presentation

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,800
will be also about shared responsibility

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,120
how shared responsibility will

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,420
bring us digital trust will will bring

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,600
us higher security for this critical

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,200
industry

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,360
so we live in the fourth Industrial

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
Revolution

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,960
and this age is actually bringing

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,320
technological advances it's changing the

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,260
way we live the way we work

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,140
and uh this is uh

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,640
actually an age where the things the

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,759
word is full of things which are sensing

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,220
which are collecting data about the

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,100
environment about us the things are

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,840
connected as we could hear from the

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,420
previous presentation

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,460
and also things are being intelligent so

33
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,799
um based on the data collected based on

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,240
the connections uh based on the

35
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,820
circumstances uh intelligence is there

36
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,880
everywhere in all the industry also we

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,579
can say that the ICT infrastructure will

38
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,439
be the foundation of this new word

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
but this

40
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,479
digital growth

41
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,159
these disruptive Technologies which are

42
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,619
changing our lives brings us not just

43
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,320
opportunities but challenges as well

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,318
what are these challenges the

45
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
opportunities first of all the cloud

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,200
usage of cloud cloudification brings us

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
advantage of resource sharing easy

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
resource sharing there are more and more

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
open platforms

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,440
instead of closed platforms available

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,300
the usage of AI and Big Data

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,720
gives power to in-depth mining in that

53
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,360
mining of information

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,440
the mobile networks and sensors which

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,540
are interconnected to each other and to

56
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,019
the network and the central servers

57
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,680
are actually

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,140
collecting information and giving us the

59
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,319
opportunity to

60
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,560
infer from the data and deliver great

61
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,700
results

62
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,980
what are the challenges

63
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,379
the challenges are that and we could

64
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,120
hear in the previous presentation as

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,840
well that the traditional Network

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,220
parameter

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,659
is blurred uh protection should not be

68
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,060
just on the network perimeter level the

69
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,060
protection should be zero trust based as

70
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,459
we could hear earlier

71
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,980
also the data processing is not just

72
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,099
happening in the traditional data center

73
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,260
it's happening everywhere the data

74
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,040
processing is not only at one place but

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,900
is distributed

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,959
uh probably you heard also about Edge

77
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,239
computing

78
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,220
because of these new technologies the

79
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,560
attack surface becomes larger and larger

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,360
and this attack surface gives uh also

81
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,280
the risk of additional vulnerabilities

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,720
so number of vulnerability is increasing

83
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,879
how can we overcome these challenges

84
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,280
what what are the solutions

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,120
and I show you one example the airline

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,120
industry the airline industry has

87
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,879
successfully

88
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,500
established an ecosystem where we can

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,459
trust

90
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,940
why do we trust because we get on the

91
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,180
plane there are aircrafts which we

92
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,020
consider safe this entire ecosystem why

93
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,699
is it safe why do we trust in this

94
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,240
ecosystem it's because each and every

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,900
stakeholder each and every participant

96
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,900
does its own job responsibly

97
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,919
they are uh and and the entire safety

98
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,460
rules security rules are based on

99
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,320
predefined and and commonly agreed

100
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,979
standards and everybody

101
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:52,860
agrees to this and everybody

102
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,380
meet all the requirements

103
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,540
what are other other ways to respond to

104
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,960
these increasing number of challenges

105
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,500
how EU is responding you started to

106
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,060
respond to this increasing number of

107
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,620
challenges in 2013

108
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,419
where they established the cyber

109
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,979
security strategy

110
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,979
uh later on more and more directives and

111
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:27,900
and strategies come out uh recently you

112
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,479
could hear Yesterday then this the

113
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,220
second version of Nice

114
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,520
has been accepted by European Commission

115
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,740
it will be a very very uh thorough and

116
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,500
important

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,419
directive which has to be put into a law

118
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,880
in each and every EU countries

119
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,340
and it will impact many many Industries

120
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,180
now the question is how

121
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,840
uh the such Rule and such law can be

122
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
enforced and who will finance the

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,620
preparation of especially the small and

124
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,840
medium Enterprises but that's another

125
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,139
question another topic of presentation

126
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,400
also uh a month ago cyber resilience act

127
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,360
has been also released which will be

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,900
again an important

129
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,919
factor and will Define uh let's say the

130
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,060
security basic security level of uh

131
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,759
digital digitally connected products

132
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,220
also these challenges when we look at

133
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,500
these challenges we have to look at from

134
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,780
the angle of complex systems

135
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,199
these complex systems as NSR the

136
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,419
European cyber security agency defined

137
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:52,520
these complex systems contain several

138
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,160
stakeholders and layers

139
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,940
um

140
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,360
the ICT system sectoral ICT systems

141
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,600
which provide services to the end users

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,660
heavily rely on ICT infrastructure such

143
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,300
as 5G over cloud computing

144
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,400
which are made of ICT products which are

145
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,639
delivered or provided by ICT vendors and

146
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,300
what Anisa says that these layers are

147
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,080
very much interconnected to each other

148
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,160
and the security of this entire uh

149
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,620
system the complex system

150
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,539
is responsible is a shared

151
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,099
responsibility each and every

152
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,860
stakeholder must do its own job

153
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,019
[Music]

154
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,479
now

155
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,780
um 5G becomes essential in more and more

156
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,120
Industries

157
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,680
so

158
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,479
um

159
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,599
the 5G is already available in smart

160
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,860
plans

161
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,340
there are also the 5G technology is also

162
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,599
available in healthcare for example you

163
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,180
could hear about

164
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,900
complex operations where one of the

165
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,720
professor was available only remotely

166
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,400
through a VR glass

167
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,580
or it's available in agriculture it's

168
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,860
available in education as well

169
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,039
and there are

170
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,379
several Industries

171
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:31,159
plants Logistics centers which already

172
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:36,719
use uh the advantage of 5G connections

173
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,000
now the security of

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,399
because of this the security of 5G

175
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,260
networks is critical

176
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,040
and it must meet higher requirements why

177
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,339
why do I say this it's because the

178
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:51,899
industry application industry

179
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,240
applications

180
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,180
which are carried out on uh on 5G

181
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,399
Networks are actually

182
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,660
connected also to the Enterprise

183
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,180
networks so the border line is blurred

184
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,339
between the five carrier provided 5G

185
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,920
Network and the Enterprise Network

186
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,620
for example the user plane function

187
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,140
which is deployed at the network Edge

188
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,380
it carries also Enterprise applications

189
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,880
and uh why because uh the latency of

190
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,760
these applications is critical

191
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,580
so what does it mean it means that such

192
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,410
networks must not only

193
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,540
[Music]

194
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,779
satisfy the carrier carrier's own

195
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,839
security requirement but must also meet

196
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,360
the industry all the industry

197
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,980
requirements and all the

198
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,000
or the industry requirements and all the

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,820
Enterprise requirements as well so it

200
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,940
means very very high standards must be

201
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,940
met

202
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,240
now on the next slide

203
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
I hope I can start a video for you just

204
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,160
to demonstrate one of the application

205
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,180
if

206
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,660
a second

207
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,160
okay it may not work but

208
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,500
just to tell you about that so in

209
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,519
financial care there is a

210
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,959
logistics terminal

211
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,680
it is about uh

212
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,140
it's about

213
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,320
Railways you may know that in between

214
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,260
Hungary and Ukraine

215
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,740
there is a different uh

216
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,200
Railway system

217
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,779
in Hungary it's uh it's different the

218
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,079
distance between the pair of Railways is

219
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,839
smaller than than in Ukraine therefore

220
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,959
what what needs to be done is there has

221
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,240
to be

222
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,459
you know wagons which are coming from

223
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,000
Ukraine has to be the the packages and

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,880
the entire stuff has to be moved to a

225
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,000
Hungarian uh wagon

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,019
and all these things are done remotely

227
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,200
through crane cranes and these big

228
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,180
cranes are not operated locally

229
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,100
but through a terminal

230
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,560
over 5G Network

231
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,279
I

232
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,140
I suggest that you check on YouTube this

233
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,920
video it's very nice it shows how the

234
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,700
entire 5G

235
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,660
operation is done remotely through 5G

236
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,959
Network

237
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,820
and what are other key security

238
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,220
challenges of 5G Networks

239
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,500
there are different business changes

240
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,480
these business changes are coming from

241
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,540
three different applications one of them

242
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,760
requires a very high mobile bandwidth

243
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,700
in-house mobile bandwidth such as

244
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,440
delivery of images through 5G

245
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,200
video images

246
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,660
the other one is massive machine type

247
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,540
communication it's for smart plants

248
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,079
where uh autonomous vehicles talk to

249
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,480
each other uh communicate to each other

250
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,600
and to the servers in factories

251
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,320
and the last one is ultra reliable low

252
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,980
latency computing

253
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,519
communication where it's very important

254
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,579
to have a very low latency communication

255
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,639
between the for example between cars so

256
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,019
it's about intelligent driving

257
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,820
and uh uh between the central

258
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,680
system as well

259
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,620
Network changes only two things to

260
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,420
mention here a service-based

261
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,019
architecture is the new

262
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:39,860
feature of 5G Network and

263
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,720
slicing in terms of technological

264
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,459
changes I have already mentioned the

265
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,700
cloud usage of clouds and virtualization

266
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,560
so the network functions are virtualized

267
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,899
and on the bottom of the screen you can

268
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,300
see how the 5G architecture consists of

269
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,639
there are different layers so there is a

270
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,240
layered architecture which is uh

271
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,980
also a new thing in in 5G Networks

272
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,760
now let's look at uh

273
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
if let's say there are attacks or there

274
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,540
were attacks to 5G

275
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,019
applications then then which part of the

276
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,000
architecture was attacked

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
what we can see from from a database

278
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,800
world largest database hacks is that

279
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,480
majority of the attacks are done on

280
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,220
applications

281
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,699
and only two percent of the attacks hex

282
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:46,699
were done at the product layer

283
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,060
so

284
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,638
regardless of whether uh

285
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,380
which which layer gets the heat it's

286
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,839
very important to protect all of them

287
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,160
but just be aware that uh

288
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,980
when you hear about that 5G system was

289
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,500
hacked do not always think that the

290
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,620
network was hacked usually when you hear

291
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,760
such news then think about that it might

292
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,860
be also the application which is on top

293
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,079
of the entire 5G infrastructure

294
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,459
and that if that application if that

295
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:27,180
code if that code is is not secure

296
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,940
enough there's no end-to-end security

297
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,000
then uh

298
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,100
yeah there will be it will be very easy

299
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,420
to have a data leakage or a hacked

300
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,839
application

301
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,120
now in order to improve the security

302
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,300
what do we need to do

303
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,519
um as we then any other information

304
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,699
security application CIA is very

305
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,920
important confidentiality integrity and

306
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,560
availability what does it mean in terms

307
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,899
of 5G

308
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:02,660
uh and 5G networks

309
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,040
confidential Integrity we have to

310
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,180
protect the user information

311
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,220
the subscription information location of

312
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,699
the device user communication data and

313
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:18,899
also carriers data and information the

314
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,579
cdrs

315
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,579
availability we have to identify illegal

316
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,820
attacks which try to make the systems

317
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,519
unavailable

318
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,000
and traceability is very important so

319
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,560
log everything so that uh later on when

320
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,959
there is an incident it's possible to

321
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,100
identify where and how what happened and

322
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,480
where it has come from

323
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,579
so in order to secure a 5G which players

324
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,779
which stakeholders need to work on this

325
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,540
and collaborate

326
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,899
there are vendors the the responsibility

327
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,720
of the vendors is to provide the product

328
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,720
security and to make sure that that

329
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,359
development processes are fully secure

330
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,419
they follow security by Design privacy

331
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,000
by design standards

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,299
operators then the carriers

333
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,640
their responsibilities to build a secure

334
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,119
and rely resilient Network and Implement

335
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,240
in-depth security

336
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,760
service providers are responsible for

337
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,360
end-to-end security and they have a

338
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,120
responsibility service application data

339
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,880
security as well these are the three key

340
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,320
players

341
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,960
but they are supported by standard

342
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,620
organizations and also governmented

343
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,440
Regulatory Agencies the standard

344
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,340
organizations Define the standards

345
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:01,280
for 5G networks and the government

346
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,160
just uh releases the lows and sets up

347
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,120
also standards mandatory for certain

348
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,360
applications Industries or or

349
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,360
infrastructure

350
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,280
so

351
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,919
let me just go back so there are three

352
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,500
so I brought three solutions to these to

353
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
these problems and challenges

354
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,100
one of them is a design principles when

355
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,740
thinking about 5G building 5G

356
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,919
architecture what are the key design

357
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,460
principles the second one is a 5G secure

358
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,120
knowledge base security knowledge base

359
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,240
which is mainly uh for service providers

360
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,880
and operators and the third tool is

361
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,220
nasas which is a network equipment

362
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,240
security Assurance scheme

363
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,600
mainly for vendors and operators

364
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,640
so regarding the first one what are the

365
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,220
design top level design principles for

366
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,940
uh for 5G cyber security

367
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,280
principle number one is in-depth defense

368
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,980
uh maybe you heard already about in this

369
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,880
conference it's practically protection

370
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,220
against border intrusion and lateral

371
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,740
movement attacks

372
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,480
uh these uh some examples

373
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,440
anti-dos Access Control encryption

374
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,120
anti-tempering measures

375
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,720
the second principle is zero trust zero

376
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,600
trusted 5G what does it mean it means

377
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,980
what you heard earlier in the

378
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,140
presentation uh

379
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,740
do not trust always verify never trust

380
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,260
always verify so do not just

381
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,780
authenticate the user but always check

382
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,059
the other uh parameters as well and

383
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,100
there has to be a continuous and dynamic

384
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,880
evaluation of uh each and every access

385
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,419
request

386
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,940
principle number three is adaptive

387
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,600
security which means

388
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,440
continuously optimizing based on ipdrr

389
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,260
methodology

390
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,500
uh and continuously detecting and and

391
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,200
looking for anomalies and when animal is

392
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,840
found there has to be a

393
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,220
manual or semi-automated uh response uh

394
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,620
to those Network anomalies which are

395
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,059
found

396
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,860
and very important to mention the

397
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,900
security development life cycle which

398
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,650
has to be fully in place uh

399
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,160
[Music]

400
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,799
for application developer or also for

401
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,520
product manufacturers as well

402
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,880
now the second tool I want to mention is

403
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,480
a is the 5G cyber security knowledge

404
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,660
base

405
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,360
what is it exactly

406
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,000
it's actually a document Repository

407
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,020
which has been prepared by

408
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,559
gsma members gsma is a collection of

409
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,919
organizations from the mobile industry

410
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,740
and uh they have shared their best

411
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,780
practices and their knowledge and

412
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,139
created a document repository which uh

413
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,900
lists all the threats to the 5G networks

414
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,380
but not only threats are listed but also

415
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,700
controls uh controls how to

416
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,460
mitigate those those threats and risks

417
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,140
so this is actually a very good case for

418
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,100
collaboration between different

419
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,480
stakeholders in the 5G industry

420
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,179
just to give you a feeling of what this

421
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,240
5G secular security knowledge base looks

422
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,740
like

423
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,240
um you can see uh on the left side

424
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,400
it is based on comprehensive threat

425
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,020
analyzes

426
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,820
and actually 44 threats were identified

427
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,059
11 problems which were found on live

428
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:27,720
networks 22 risk items which are from

429
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,780
the Anisa threat landscape and Industry

430
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,080
knowledge base and there were also 11

431
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,980
published vulnerabilities from gsma

432
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,980
security vulnerability Library

433
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,559
and each of these threads are grouped

434
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,960
into different fields the fields are

435
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,240
actually the network architecture

436
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,120
elements user equipment radio Access

437
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,200
Network core Cloud Internet connect

438
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,440
and on the right side you see for each

439
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,940
and every thread

440
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,419
there is a detailed description of what

441
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,659
it looks like so in our case it's a Dos

442
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,780
attack against a core Network

443
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,260
and the methodology is also mentioned

444
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,200
there how the attack is done who is

445
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,659
doing it through what devices which

446
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,419
Protocols are used during the attack

447
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,820
and also the impact what is the

448
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,360
potential impact of such an attack uh

449
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,340
impact can be unavailability of the

450
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,240
network of course because of the Dos

451
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,760
attack and also unavailability of the

452
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,620
customer service because they will be

453
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,140
overwhelmed by

454
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:44,659
a number of calls from Angry users

455
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,220
also this knowledge base as I mentioned

456
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,760
earlier gives us a mitigation

457
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,320
options or Solutions as well

458
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,000
and on on the right side you see uh each

459
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,220
and every stakeholder the vendor

460
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,380
equipment vendor the operator the

461
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,600
carrier and the service provider the

462
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,700
application developer

463
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,020
um can also see what needs to be done

464
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,900
to

465
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,200
mitigate the risk of such threat so for

466
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,480
example service provider has to look for

467
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,539
abnormal behavior of their applications

468
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:29,419
the operator has to deploy anti-dose

469
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:33,539
devices or signaling firewalls

470
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,980
and the vendors has to implement antidos

471
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,020
patent recognition mechanism in their

472
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,620
equipment as well so just this was just

473
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,860
an example of Dos attack against core

474
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,960
network

475
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,059
but there are of course additional

476
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,480
threats also mentioned in this um

477
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,080
in this knowledge base and the gsma the

478
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,780
GSM Association

479
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,760
believes that these 5G security risks

480
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,860
can be addressed through the deployment

481
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,679
of coordinated and verifiable security

482
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,880
measures based on common standards

483
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,500
now the third tool is nessus what nasas

484
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,500
is Network equipment security Assurance

485
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,539
scheme which is a standard

486
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:26,419
it has been

487
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:30,120
created developed by gsma the GSM

488
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,460
Association and the 3gpp the gsma is the

489
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,460
older mobile network

490
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,880
stakeholders the shareholders and and

491
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,480
3gpp is The

492
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,799
Regulators it's the association of

493
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,740
regulators from different countries

494
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,299
so

495
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,520
um and what what it is exactly so it's

496
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,340
an assurance scheme

497
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,760
it provides

498
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,380
opportunity to verify the equipment

499
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,320
providers security processes development

500
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,659
the security of development process

501
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,779
itself how secure it is

502
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:18,179
also uh discuss evaluation

503
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,720
specification is mentioned which is

504
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,539
targeting the equipment

505
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,940
so

506
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,940
the network equipments which are used to

507
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,740
build a 5G Network

508
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,360
can be and are usually tested

509
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,760
not only tested by The Operators or

510
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,580
carriers but can be tested in a

511
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,340
certified Laboratories and can get an

512
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,600
evaluation report a stamp that yes it

513
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,720
this equipment went through all the test

514
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,020
cases and it is it can be considered a

515
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,220
secure

516
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,860
why is this good what are the benefits

517
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,279
of such a standard such scheme is that

518
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,159
it's it's a it's something it's not just

519
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,960
developed by one country

520
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,320
it's developed uh my multiple countries

521
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,580
globally uh uh it's developed by

522
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,000
industry uh regulators and players so

523
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,820
it's commonly accepted and there is an

524
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,340
expectation that also and these are the

525
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,400
European cyber security agency will

526
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,559
adopt nasas and will also make it

527
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,620
mandatory for telecommunication Networks

528
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,559
uh why is it good it's it's good because

529
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,140
it's uh it defines technological

530
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,100
requirements tangible so not static

531
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,860
requirements uh tangible uh and and

532
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,779
does not differentiate vendors based on

533
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,059
the country of origin for example

534
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,580
but looks at only the technical uh

535
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,520
things of of the equipment and it's

536
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,679
continuously evolved so over the time

537
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,279
the features of of 5G networks are

538
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,620
constantly new features are of the 5G

539
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,600
Network are considered and also

540
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,000
additional threats and risks are also

541
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,940
mitigated in this new versions of of

542
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,539
NASA's

543
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,740
to give you a summary of how it looks

544
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,419
what it looks like so on the top you see

545
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:28,820
NASA's requirements towards the

546
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,080
development and product development

547
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,720
process

548
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,020
um you see the standard life cycle of

549
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,080
secure development design coding

550
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,940
compilation testing release operation

551
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,240
Operation and for each step there are

552
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,960
multi multiple set of

553
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,580
Standards which are set

554
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,919
in the requirements

555
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,640
second version of nessus also considers

556
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,460
the process of

557
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,360
insourcing of sourcing of third-party

558
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,940
components because

559
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,159
it's also a you know supply chain

560
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,159
security is nobody is one of the biggest

561
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,700
uh

562
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,620
threat to the security of these

563
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,120
ecosystems

564
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,500
so nessus will also make sure that

565
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,880
sourcing of third-party components

566
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,399
process will be also evaluated and

567
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,640
checked discuss specifications as I

568
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,919
mentioned it's about equipment testing

569
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,120
so testing the core G node B the ran

570
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,360
equipment more and more equipments added

571
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,399
so the second version contains

572
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:50,658
additional seven uh set of test cases

573
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,500
follows also technical measures of EU 5G

574
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,440
toolbox u5g toolbox was introduced in

575
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,419
2020 my European

576
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:07,919
commission and Anisa and it's very

577
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,460
important toolbox

578
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,159
especially the technical requirements

579
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,679
and the NASA's fully supports all these

580
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,419
technical requirements as you can see

581
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,700
there are a few technical requirements

582
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,679
which are not related to equipment such

583
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,260
as physical security

584
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,200
those are not really related to nasas

585
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,440
and nessus does not cover those

586
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,460
what are what are the benefits for

587
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,440
different stakeholders of the mobile

588
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,020
industry the key benefits for mobile

589
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,360
network operators is that they can have

590
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,539
a visibility of security capabilities of

591
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,820
equipment vendors and their network

592
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,419
products prior to purchase so they can

593
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,919
see that okay I want to buy this

594
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,860
equipment does it have a stamp or not if

595
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,740
it has if it has been tested evaluated

596
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,350
in a certified laboratory then

597
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,260
[Music]

598
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,500
they can be sure that they are

599
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,140
purchasing a safe equipment

600
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,140
also it can reduce the security testing

601
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,899
of testing efforts of these of these

602
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:20,520
operators so

603
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,159
because all the tests has been done in

604
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,440
the certification Laboratory

605
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,440
the benefit for National authorities and

606
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,840
Regulators is that this is a secretary

607
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,640
Australian screen which is ready to use

608
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,159
ready for use it can increase the

609
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,899
effective security

610
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,520
not impacting negatively the industry

611
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,320
the benefits for equipment vendors is

612
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,919
that they can using these uh these temps

613
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,679
and the test reports they can

614
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,500
demonstrate the adherence to security

615
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,840
requirements to the stakeholders uh

616
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,940
these this can also illustrate

617
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,440
development maintenance and product

618
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,539
security capabilities of the vendor

619
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,760
so finally

620
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,679
um I have to

621
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,840
I want to emphasize that shared

622
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,720
responsibility is nowadays both Trend

623
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,860
and necessity so the security of complex

624
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,520
systems ecosystems such as 5G can only

625
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,679
work if we can call cooperate and

626
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,600
collaborate in each and every

627
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,000
stakeholder does its own job in terms of

628
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,799
ensuring the security of the entire

629
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,260
ecosystem the standards organizations

630
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,600
might must Define the standards for the

631
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,620
industry

632
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,440
or for the applications the service

633
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,020
providers and operators has to make sure

634
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,559
that end-to-end security is is uh done

635
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,080
When developing an application and also

636
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,840
operating applicational Network the ICT

637
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,940
suppliers must make sure that their

638
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,080
development product development or

639
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,880
product development processes are fully

640
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,340
secured they they follow security by

641
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,440
Design privacy by Design

642
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,919
and the citizens uh the users of the

643
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,279
applications must also follow

644
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:14,899
instructions they have to behave

645
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:17,039
responsibly and the government

646
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,740
responsibility is to oversee the entire

647
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,940
process and make sure that the right

648
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,679
standards are set in law

649
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,100
which are not differentiating on on

650
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,200
static requirements such as country of

651
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,700
origin but rather focusing on technical

652
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,539
measures

653
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,740
so I would like to thank you for your

654
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,019
attention I know it was this was the

655
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,299
last presentation and you are all

656
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,380
waiting for the awards so

657
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,179
the words are from Klaus schwabe the

658
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,279
Schwab the founder and executive

659
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,679
chairman of the world economic Forum the

660
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,679
fourth Industrial Revolution brings us

661
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,980
benefits and we can grasp all the

662
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,219
opportunities it presents if and as long

663
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,619
as we are able to collaborate across

664
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:15,119
Industries across disciplines and across

665
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,919
geographies thank you very much

666
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,719
thank you very much venzel

667
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,899
I see some hands in here that means we

668
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,300
have some questions good

669
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,280
hello

670
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,839
considering that 5G networks use the

671
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:33,659
same infrastructure as 4G 3G and 2G

672
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,599
networks do these security measures

673
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:40,700
being applied backwards compatible

674
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,199
so

675
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,320
the 5G network is is different by

676
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,560
architecture and I think that there are

677
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,139
new requirements coming in when it's

678
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,199
about 5G different Protocols are used

679
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,140
[Music]

680
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,820
and in terms of 5G systems there are two

681
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,260
different types one is a standalone 5G

682
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,960
and a non-standard one the non-standard

683
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,859
one is is based on the existing 4G or 3G

684
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,000
network why the Standalone is is built

685
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
from scratch so for the non-standalone

686
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,240
uh when you are building a 5G Network

687
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,079
you have to also consider the

688
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,960
potential issues of the

689
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,040
former let's say 4G or 3G networks as

690
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,900
well and you have to also mitigate those

691
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,920
risks

692
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,460
although we can say that if we compare

693
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,060
the 4G to 5G the 5G is more secure just

694
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,880
to give you an example uh the encryption

695
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,900
level uh is

696
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,260
256 bit instead of 128.

697
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,220
and there are in terms of uh integration

698
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,540
sorry Integrity yes

699
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,099
there are also additional Protections in

700
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,660
place

701
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,420
thank you

702
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,579
we have here in front and one question

703
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,740
in the back

704
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,820
okay so you said that the 5G security is

705
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,599
way better than the 4G but uh how did

706
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,720
the companies

707
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,520
manage to protect the network from

708
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,700
downgrade attacks it's uh quite

709
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,820
pointless to have amazing Security on

710
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,520
one network if all you need to do is

711
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,740
downgrade the user to a 4G network and

712
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,700
apply a vulnerability

713
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,680
I'm not sure I understand your question

714
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,000
so downgrading the uh from 5G to 4G yes

715
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,760
[Music]

716
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,880
you have two networks in a parallel

717
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,280
running right you have the 4G network

718
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,880
and the 5G Network

719
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,320
usually you get downgraded when the

720
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,240
signal gets low

721
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,700
to keep connectivity

722
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,300
uh are there any security measures in

723
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,060
place to secure uh

724
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,300
this practice of downgrading like for

725
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,079
example uh if you have a Jammer you can

726
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,200
easily downgrade you make so that the

727
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,180
phone or the iot device or whatever

728
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,420
doesn't have any more 5G signal are

729
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,280
there any security measures for example

730
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,079
I guess

731
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,859
the provider of the network to send a

732
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,859
map of the coverage and the phone or the

733
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,380
device to check via GPS if it should

734
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,260
have or not a 5G signal

735
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,380
yeah so I think in in your case we are

736
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,900
talking about non-stand non-standal on

737
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,920
5G networks which are based on 4G so

738
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,980
there are 4G network elements also and

739
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,640
uh and on top of that 5G is added so yes

740
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,339
you have to also make sure that the

741
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:05,940
existing 4G so uh 4G network and network

742
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,400
elements are also secured but if you

743
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,619
look at this knowledge base

744
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,760
which I mentioned and uh nasas they are

745
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,180
not only for 5G but also for 4G as well

746
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,980
so if all these uh threats which are

747
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:26,280
identified for 5G are are mitigated then

748
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,920
you can be sure that you are also

749
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,160
protecting the 4G network as well

750
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,799
okay okay I see thank you

751
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,579
it was yeah please

752
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,680
um my question is

753
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,040
with the 6G around the corner According

754
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,680
to some articles at least do you think

755
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,760
that current Enterprise users will focus

756
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,820
on improving 5G security or will just

757
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,700
jump to the 6G Network in hopes of

758
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,299
better security

759
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,320
um

760
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,260
I'm not sure I heard it can you repeat

761
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,160
the question so with six Gene networks

762
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,260
around the corner According to some

763
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,320
articles at least do you think based on

764
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,480
your expertise and experience do you

765
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,300
think that the current Enterprise users

766
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,079
will focus on improving the 5G security

767
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:29,160
or just jump to the 6G Network in just

768
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,740
hoping for better security okay thank

769
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,060
you and I heard it so yes

770
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:40,380
the six is yes it's let's say on the I'm

771
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,440
not sure that it's on the corner uh what

772
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,540
I have seen is that there was a

773
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,079
conference where 5.5 G was actually

774
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,800
discussed so 6G is is coming but it's

775
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,820
not yet available what I can tell you is

776
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,560
that uh 5G provides already the ultra

777
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,760
latency ultra low latency

778
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,619
features which can be used by

779
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,339
Enterprises for example uh up in in

780
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,280
Hungary the Huawei Logistics Center in

781
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,880
patch uses already a 5G Standalone

782
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,599
Network and autonomous vehicles are used

783
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,880
in this Factory and they are using this

784
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,280
you know feature the ultra low latency

785
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,740
feature of a 5G Network and it's more

786
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,900
than enough it's much better than Wi-Fi

787
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,700
even better than Wi-Fi six so I think

788
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,940
there is no need to wait for 6G what 6G

789
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,880
will bring yes maybe even lower latency

790
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,119
even higher bandwidth

791
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,660
but to be honest even if you have 4G if

792
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,839
you want to watch a video on your mobile

793
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,420
you don't need an extra bandwidth

794
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,300
so the extra bandwidth the 6G provided

795
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,859
extra bandwid will

796
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,140
will need it will be needed in special

797
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,980
cases special use cases for example we

798
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,099
are applications

799
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,320
this is my view I don't think that

800
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,619
enterprises will wait for 6G I think

801
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,680
they should start using the existing 5G

802
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,859
features and also Implement secure 5G

803
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,839
thank you very much pencil

804
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:28,200
if there are no other questions then ah

805
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,140
we have two

806
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,780
hello thank you for representation

807
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,640
um so you've talked about the fourth

808
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,200
wave of the industrial revolution

809
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,359
revolution right and that it's coming

810
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,180
and it's rapidly approaching but uh how

811
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,400
long do you estimate estimate it'll take

812
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,619
for it to be generalized here in Romania

813
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:48,980
since

814
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,540
I don't want to say that we're slow

815
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,820
necessarily but it takes a bit of time

816
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,980
for things to get updated around these

817
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,020
parts

818
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,560
I see so I I I think we already live in

819
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,380
the in the fourth uh in the age of

820
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,440
fourth Industrial Revolution and

821
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,200
um I think uh also in Romania there are

822
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,940
more and more Enterprises which will

823
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,940
take use of uh uh you know additional

824
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,700
sensors I think uh also there are many

825
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,480
homes in Romania full of you know

826
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,000
intelligent and connected iot uh

827
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,280
machines and these iot machines iot

828
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,700
devices will also go into factories

829
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,640
we'll go into Enterprises and

830
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,280
Enterprise wheel Enterprises will

831
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,859
definitely discover the the benefits of

832
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:42,660
you know using 5G the mesh sorry uh

833
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,599
artificial intelligence Technologies and

834
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,960
how you know our business results can be

835
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,880
uh

836
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,740
gained uh from from usage of these

837
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,780
Technologies and and as you could as you

838
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,640
could see everything is connected

839
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,540
everything will be intelligent so I

840
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,420
don't think that there is uh it's not

841
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,780
country specific so I'm sure that even

842
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,440
now if we see Romania as well

843
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,599
um of course you know there has to be a

844
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,420
proper environment and also

845
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,440
um

846
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,260
system which allows competition for

847
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,440
example which can also encourage the

848
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,339
usage of 5G networks

849
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,260
yes of course government can do a lot

850
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,140
for this to make sure that more and more

851
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,119
new technologies can be used in

852
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:38,280
Enterprises but I'm sure it's here

853
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,780
already thank you so much

854
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,260
being given the low latency of the 5G

855
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,300
Network how much longer would you

856
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,160
estimate it will take to have

857
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,859
self-driving cars

858
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:59,520
or more smarter drop traffic yeah

859
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,380
sorry can you speak a little bit louder

860
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,200
being given the low latency or the 5G

861
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,819
Network how much longer would you

862
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,579
estimate it will take to have

863
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:16,020
smart traffic or self-driving cars

864
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,640
smart driving I think uh well

865
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,200
um

866
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,260
I I would say it's it still requires

867
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,920
something like five years because uh I

868
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,540
think the basic infrastructure is not

869
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,460
there regardless of the country whether

870
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,640
it's a Hungary West Europe or uh or

871
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,520
Romania first we have to make sure that

872
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,819
that our roads are

873
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:44,900
in good shape and in good quality

874
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,880
the technology is there definitely we

875
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,900
could we can see Elon Musk and Tesla

876
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,400
what they are doing

877
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,819
it is working but the entire environment

878
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,660
has to be improved and a lot of tests

879
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,260
has to be done before it comes into the

880
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:07,400
daily life of our

881
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,300
of of of us actually so I would say five

882
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,680
to ten years

883
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,279
thank you

884
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,560
thank you very much

885
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,920
and I guess we can share with manzila

886
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,260
around of applause

887
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,430
thank you

888
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:31,819
[Applause]
