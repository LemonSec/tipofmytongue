1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
as Mitch I said I am the Chief

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,720
Information Security Officer of nuclear

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,540
electrical nuclear electrica is a

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,119
Romanian

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,980
government-owned company and we are

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,679
operating a nuclear power plant in

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,139
chernavoda and also a nuclear fuel

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,220
Factory near pitest in my oven

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,039
and for sure we're dealing with a lot of

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,859
technical

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,099
OT security stuff we are protecting a

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,000
very complex nuclear environment two

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,160
reactors can do reactors

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,700
and today I will discuss about a project

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,520
that we initiated

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,360
as by the way as we are innovating on

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,300
the you know Common energy things like

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,160
trying to implement in Romania and a

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,940
small modular reactor technology we are

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,440
keeping the same track on the cyber

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,199
security and we are developing the first

22
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,239
Romanian information sharing and

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,680
Analysis Center

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,080
it is uh actually something that we we

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,420
we started two years back

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,320
when we applied for a European funding

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,100
and we were accepted because as an

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,100
introduction at the European level we

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,920
have the misdirective most of you know

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
about that

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,360
so in the directive we have some domains

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,020
defined for essential service providers

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,320
right and European commission and

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,040
actually most of the Cyber related

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,900
organizations at the European level said

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,360
yeah for each of them we should have an

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,500
Isaac

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
but what were what will do at the

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,420
national level because we have critical

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,100
infrastructures like in energy

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,960
Healthcare and so on and so banking

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,380
right we should encourage the

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,960
organizations the biggest organizations

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,840
from each country to develop locally and

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,520
information sharing analysis Center and

46
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,380
this was the let's say long story short

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,520
how this project uh

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,199
was initiated

49
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,940
first I want to present the mention

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,280
because it is very important to to

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,040
settle like a common understanding for

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,520
everybody to to to see how an Isaac can

53
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,980
help the organizations I know maybe not

54
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,739
all of you are working for an energy or

55
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,920
electricity related organization but for

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,200
sure is something that can be applied in

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,260
other Industries like in health in

58
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,200
healthcare or in banking and there are

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,020
many very mature uh ice acts like fsis

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,800
Financial Services Isaac in in

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,099
in in the market let's say so we are

62
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,500
trying to to bring together on the same

63
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,720
table organizations like nuclear

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,260
electrica and we have for example as the

65
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,000
initial members

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,300
a hydroelectrica a similar organization

67
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,700
as they are operating Hydro

68
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,360
power plants we have room gas they are

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,120
the the gas natural gas producer in

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
Romania

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,920
and many others that are now in

72
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,200
discussions with us to become a member

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,280
is not like a very easy

74
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,680
application because we are trying to to

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,159
to to keep only the the important

76
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,700
members at this phase and later on we

77
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,220
can for example allow like the uh

78
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,739
smaller organizations from the from the

79
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,420
energy

80
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,280
also we have the support from the

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,900
remaining directory for for cyber

82
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,080
security they are giving us very useful

83
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,959
and valuable support of in developing

84
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,840
this project and we have Academia and

85
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,260
research we have EG Bucharest and we

86
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,540
have also service providers and the

87
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,819
first one is Sans Institute they have a

88
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,519
boot here in and they are presented this

89
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,159
conference

90
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,680
and now let's define what an Isaac do

91
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,599
and what we are doing for Romanian

92
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,199
energy sector we are trying to identify

93
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,478
the the prioritized intelligence

94
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,820
requirements because intelligence threat

95
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,100
intelligence as a concept and there are

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,900
many vendors in in the market that are

97
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,759
providing they are delivering threat

98
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,840
intelligence Services threat

99
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,360
intelligence Fields but you know there

100
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,720
are millions of ips millions of iocs how

101
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,840
should I handle all of them

102
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
what which of them are applicable for me

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,900
all those states are applicable for me

104
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,860
maybe not

105
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,560
I want to be more focused on the threads

106
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,660
that are applicable for my industry at

107
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,600
least or to my organization right

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,639
and for that there is some effort that

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,639
should be engaged and honestly I didn't

110
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,180
see in the market like uh

111
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,880
very focused threat intelligence fees

112
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,979
that can help organizations in this in

113
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,540
this way

114
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,380
but this is the reason why the ice X you

115
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,900
know were were developed across the

116
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,940
globe and there are as I said earlier

117
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,580
very mature Isaacs with very long

118
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,639
practice in in the in the in the field

119
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,979
uh

120
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,580
second

121
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,580
we is something that because

122
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,639
geopolitically is we're near a war zone

123
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,100
or area the conflict between Russia and

124
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,780
Ukraine right we need to understand

125
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,840
better our enemies right not all the

126
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,080
organizations have the the resources or

127
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,400
the skill set

128
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,180
to start you know digging deeper uh on

129
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,840
the on the threat actors Behavior it's

130
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,300
not very easier to see exactly what is

131
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,180
the TTP what is the tactic technique and

132
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,840
procedures used or you know developed by

133
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,180
a specific threat actor maybe a Russian

134
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,300
threat actor that is time consuming you

135
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,240
need to know the to have the skill set

136
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,340
and the nice I can come in place and

137
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,919
help organizations with such things

138
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,560
uh also

139
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,380
we based on the discussions we had with

140
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,800
our members we identified

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,479
another kind of need it's not related to

142
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,880
trade intelligence they they want to

143
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,900
have

144
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,100
uh uh a trusted community of peers to

145
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,780
discuss with they want to sit together

146
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,560
and say okay let's now dissect for

147
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,400
example nisdirective or low 360

148
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,460
362 right there there is a order coming

149
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,680
from the remaining director for cyber

150
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,180
security there are some requirements

151
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,919
from there but how should I Implement

152
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,720
them in a very complex environment

153
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,280
because

154
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,199
for a such organization as nuclear

155
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,660
electric or hydroelectrica and other

156
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,940
similar is not very easy to say okay

157
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,380
let's Implement a vulnerability

158
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,720
Management program and in two months I

159
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,780
will I will be done with that no you

160
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,720
have at least three types of

161
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,940
environments you have I.T environment

162
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,340
business ID environment you have OT

163
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,720
environment and you have physical

164
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,979
security environment right and each of

165
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,680
these sub domains of cyber security as I

166
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,960
said vulnerability management

167
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,560
it requires more effort or you know a

168
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
specific skill set to enable you to do

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,180
that and maybe some lessons learned from

170
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,080
other peers or you know some guidance

171
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,139
from other peers is useful is allowing

172
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,220
the our members to implement their uh

173
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,800
the law requirements more easier right

174
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,199
sorry push on the

175
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,699
yeah

176
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,699
so these are the the main capabilities

177
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,220
we defined uh

178
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,919
outside of trade intelligence order and

179
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,919
threat intelligent sharing we we said

180
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,840
okay maybe it's better to define

181
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,639
something like awareness because

182
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,919
awareness I'm not saying that it's very

183
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,199
simple to be done but it's something

184
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,020
that is more easier right and very

185
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,380
useful and the benefit of doing that are

186
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,819
very clear

187
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,639
but we can in disac we can define a

188
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,039
framework for example if I want to do I

189
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,259
don't know Awareness on spear fishing

190
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,500
okay the same template I'm working on I

191
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,139
can share it with my peer from

192
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,360
hydroelectrica and he can take it save

193
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,760
couple of hours doing that just

194
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,399
customizing it a little bit and then use

195
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,260
it internally right

196
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,020
training the same we have pretty much

197
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,839
the same needs we know what are let's

198
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,399
say this what is the skill set that we

199
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,800
need and

200
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,540
where we want to invest in the skill set

201
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,899
that we we want to have right and we can

202
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,200
approach together that or the Isaac can

203
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,019
deliver training right for for the

204
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,640
members

205
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,500
uh other initiatives as this ISAC

206
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,959
project there are other projects

207
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,480
of course with European funding or not

208
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,700
it doesn't matter but can be done

209
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,459
together with other peers it's just if

210
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,860
you want to see this Isaac as a

211
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,800
community of communities and the

212
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
community of projects

213
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,720
can allow the members to develop the

214
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,399
projects together right various things

215
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,019
guidelines and Frameworks

216
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,040
here it's similar what I said earlier I

217
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,560
don't know nist cyber security framework

218
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,380
or nist framework for risk management

219
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,580
37 I think

220
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,240
right that if it can be downloaded from

221
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,860
the next web page but is somebody who

222
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,620
already implemented it yes okay so it

223
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,660
can have some lessons and can give me

224
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,820
some insights how to do that right that

225
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,920
can be discussed but I cannot discuss

226
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,779
that you know public with everybody

227
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,640
because

228
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,959
I I will give him some you know details

229
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,800
about the gears that I have or there are

230
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,200
some details confidential details that I

231
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,540
cannot you know make it make them public

232
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,480
so that is the reason why we want to

233
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,120
have this trusted relationship between

234
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,680
the the same sector members

235
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,140
and the reports uh the third

236
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,500
intelligence reports not only the feeds

237
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,240
we are delivering for example monthly

238
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
trade intelligence reports for our

239
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,300
members and is those are helping them to

240
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,820
to to guide their effort to identify the

241
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,120
threats that have a bigger chance to to

242
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,880
to impact them right as I said for

243
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,339
example I don't know banking projects

244
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,440
are something that you know

245
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,240
opportunistically can impact my

246
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,760
organization but something similar with

247
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,180
black energy three can impact me right

248
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,480
can is something that can be used by

249
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,000
similar detector or by Sim tractor

250
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,880
against me but when somebody is reading

251
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,640
a threat intelligence report sometimes

252
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,279
they see okay I see this I see this that

253
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,440
actor those details about them is

254
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,160
targeting these organizations but I have

255
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,680
my specifics in my organization how

256
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,380
should I implement it and we want or

257
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,240
nothing Romania we have our own

258
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,820
specifics and nobody can understand uh

259
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,500
you know energy sector organizations

260
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,019
better than us and in those reports we

261
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,240
are putting recommendations that are

262
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,760
applicable for them we know based on the

263
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,760
projects common projects implemented by

264
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,980
governmental organizations in Romania we

265
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,760
know pretty much what technology is

266
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,899
nuclear electrica has or either

267
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,420
electrical has and we can do

268
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,800
recommendations Focus the

269
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,959
recommendations to mitigate that that

270
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,459
threat not general ones

271
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,240
okay

272
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,000
just to dig a little bit deeper on on

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,500
the threat intelligence side which is

274
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,180
not only data right uh is not just an IP

275
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,880
that IP will make more sense if I will

276
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
link it to a threat actor I will give

277
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
him a confidence level okay because

278
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,000
today for example an IP can be used by a

279
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,560
domain but the same domain tomorrow will

280
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,240
have another IP will respond to another

281
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,680
IP right or I need to see how accurate

282
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,600
is that data should I block it maybe

283
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,060
I'll block a business related service in

284
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,459
my organization you know Billing System

285
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,579
will go down my clients will not be able

286
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,720
to to access the the mobile application

287
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,899
for billing or you know sending data to

288
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,019
to the to the electricity organization

289
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,120
so for that we need to have a confidence

290
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,480
level to trust that that data is

291
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,440
accurate and I should block it right

292
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,620
Also regarding the ttps right I want to

293
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,620
understand exactly what are the tactics

294
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,720
techniques and procedures used by the

295
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,940
threat actor I need to actually to put

296
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,000
all these four puzzle pieces together in

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,740
order to understand what is applicable

298
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,500
for me and what is not applicable I'm

299
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,540
not saying that not applicable means to

300
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,180
ignore it no but we don't have like

301
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,440
Unlimited

302
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,760
time money tools to ingest is you know

303
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,459
old iocs or and all the threat

304
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,200
intelligence data across the world we

305
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,260
want to focus and mitigate the threads

306
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,079
that are applicable for for me

307
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,060
so we want to understand the

308
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,839
capabilities that the attractor has why

309
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,899
because I want to see where I should

310
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,480
Implement you know mitigation mechanisms

311
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,200
maybe it is in the Border firewall or

312
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,480
it's just I need to do some monitoring

313
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,820
in my scene solution and that's it and

314
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,040
Trigger another art whenever the thing

315
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,040
betting is happening right I want to

316
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,620
understand what victims that threat

317
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,260
actor is targeting because as I said

318
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,360
earlier it's important to see if I

319
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,600
cannot be targeted or not

320
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,660
and also I want to understand the the

321
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,240
infrastructure all these things if I are

322
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,600
are you know put together

323
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,019
will enable the consumer or the member

324
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,240
of the Isaac to take the right to the

325
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,279
right decision

326
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,680
as you can see on this slide starting

327
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,920
with basic iocs you know from a threat

328
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,720
intelligence feed

329
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,839
you can take a malicious IP address and

330
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,940
block it or just put it in a watch list

331
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,639
or a Sim correlation Rule and that it

332
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,500
will get another and that is technical

333
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,060
trait intelligence I can do something

334
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,380
technical

335
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,380
but if I link it to a threat actor okay

336
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,839
and understand better what's going on

337
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,420
with that bad IP and I get also some

338
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,260
ttps saying okay this IP is used for

339
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,320
exploiting lock for sale good

340
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,959
something else that you know just a bad

341
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,440
IP right is maybe saying I'm not using

342
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
any Java application and you know this

343
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,540
love for

344
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,579
J library is not using my Java

345
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,699
environment so maybe he's not you know

346
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,100
the right time now to consume like five

347
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,380
minutes to add the fire rule right I

348
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,060
have something more important

349
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,060
and in this way you can be able to

350
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,279
identify more systems that can be

351
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,199
impacted by your environment in your

352
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,019
environment and defend more efficiently

353
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,620
right and the last steps like the last

354
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,260
phases of the in you know

355
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,360
contextualization of that of a threat

356
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,399
intelligence feed they are representing

357
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,399
the uh the operational part of threat

358
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,760
Intel

359
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,779
again there are some questions that

360
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,100
treat intelligence and not a simple ioc

361
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,260
can answer for example what where and

362
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,579
when right we can for example saying we

363
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,500
have the atomic indicators from from

364
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,120
misp

365
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,420
we can say this IP

366
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,260
is telling me from where is coming right

367
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,899
I have the who is details and I can say

368
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,600
is coming from Romania it's coming from

369
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,079
Russia right and how is the answer that

370
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,199
can be answered by the ttps because it's

371
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,139
defining the entire behavior of the of

372
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,079
the of the attacker or you know

373
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,180
specifically behavior of a campaign

374
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,079
right and why and who will say us the

375
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,300
train landscape is that type of report

376
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,060
that is saying is giving us the context

377
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,279
usually it's done based on some

378
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,339
historical data is not only for like a

379
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,300
snapshot

380
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,180
from a couple of days is done for

381
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,240
history for data collected for for

382
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,919
months you need to

383
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,339
uh you didn't have Telemetry collect

384
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,040
data

385
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,780
aggregate it and see some Trends

386
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,140
Identify some some patterns in the

387
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,480
behavior and then you can respond to

388
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,559
this questions why and who because for

389
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,119
example maybe you saw a lot of

390
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,500
commercial

391
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,679
vendors are saying uh apt I don't know

392
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,500
muddy water is coming from Iron how they

393
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,120
identify that

394
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,660
very easily they were watching the

395
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,660
adversary is better you know like the

396
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,000
Art of War you need to know your

397
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,679
adversary if you want to have a bigger

398
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,260
chance to to win that war right

399
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,780
all these three types of threat

400
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,480
intelligence deliverables can be

401
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,059
consumed internally in by various teams

402
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,460
the Tactical part can go to the stock

403
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,820
team to fire all directly on an

404
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,100
automated way the operational one the

405
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,600
stock analyst to understand and

406
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,120
contextualize a threat alert when they

407
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,820
are doing the triage and or analyzing it

408
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,580
or during the incident response you are

409
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,039
you are breached and you see okay I have

410
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,260
communication with this IP and I saw

411
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,539
some hashes doing bad stuff there okay

412
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,280
but you see only a small piece of that

413
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,100
of the campaign but somebody else in a

414
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,900
threat intelligence report maybe they

415
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,000
already said this is the entire list of

416
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,940
the hashes you can use it and search for

417
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,840
for in your environment for for it right

418
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,660
and the the the Strategic deliverable is

419
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,980
more dedicated for seesaws or cios sea

420
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,039
level usually right they need to to have

421
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,140
enough insights in order to take the

422
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,840
right decision for example saying yeah I

423
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
see this trend going up around somewhere

424
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,500
now

425
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,480
around summer incident now costs more

426
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,320
than 3 million per you know in average I

427
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,179
should invest more money in my in my

428
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,980
cyber security

429
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,480
team right

430
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,440
now I want to go because I I said that

431
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,740
is a light one but from technical point

432
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,539
of view it's not just going you know web

433
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,720
application user interface and just see

434
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,760
what's going on there right we are using

435
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,679
misp is

436
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,600
well known application for threat

437
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,700
intelligence and easy to be integrated

438
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,120
with with other missed Solutions

439
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,760
so the core functionality is sharing by

440
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,460
default and is something that is our is

441
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,260
is something that we want to to have

442
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,260
this is the core business of an ISAC to

443
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,660
share information with other members

444
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,340
anyone can be a consumer and or not now

445
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,080
for example you have members that

446
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,059
they're sorry they are they are

447
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,220
consumers but they are not contributors

448
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,380
they're saying okay I don't have in

449
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,220
internal capabilities to be able to you

450
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,460
know analyze uh I don't know to do

451
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,160
reverse engineering to to to extract

452
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,940
iocs from from my uh security alerts

453
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,880
okay that's fine fair enough but they

454
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,419
can be consumers and they there are two

455
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,720
two two types of consumers let's say the

456
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,600
mature ones which did an API integration

457
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,520
with our misp and they are consuming our

458
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,460
data and in you know sending it directly

459
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,440
to security controls to be blocked or

460
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,900
monitored and the basic ones which are

461
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,120
you know users that are going the web

462
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,320
interface and uh you know watching the

463
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,059
data you know watching the day

464
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:44,460
extracting only what they they want to

465
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,340
extract from there and and that's it

466
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,240
uh

467
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,980
as I said earlier and as you can see

468
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,860
here it's very easy to sorry

469
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,600
okay

470
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,539
it's very easy to integrate the multiple

471
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,220
misps because

472
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,120
we have one member and it is remain

473
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,620
directory for cyber security they have

474
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,900
their own misp right and we want to

475
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,000
collect data from them and contribute to

476
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,700
them that can be done misp to misp right

477
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,280
and there are galaxies there are

478
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,140
organizations that can be defined in the

479
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,380
misps and the data can be segregated

480
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,740
very very easily because I don't want to

481
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,780
share everything with everybody with any

482
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,760
member that I have in the Isaac we are

483
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,640
using the TLP protocol and for example

484
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,100
only with the trusted members other

485
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,860
energy sector players who are sharing

486
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,140
the the TLP Red Data TLP Amber is for

487
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,000
example shared with Academia research

488
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,880
and ngos and government

489
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,820
and so it's very easy to to support such

490
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,020
practice in in in in in an Isaac

491
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,980
how it it is working very easily they

492
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,039
can Implement a misp or not is like you

493
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,020
know they need a hardware first and then

494
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,020
they should just read the the

495
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,039
installation uh installation guide and

496
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,500
that's it pretty much because also from

497
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,600
the security point of view everything is

498
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,120
described there this missed project by

499
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,659
the way was also they have a European

500
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:25,919
funding

501
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,400
and now it's pretty pretty mature you

502
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,740
can so the member can put the the mism

503
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,520
in their environment or just you know uh

504
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,280
logging in our web interface then they

505
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,740
can connect to the thread feeds based on

506
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,900
their membership level and extract the

507
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,280
data IPS file hashes domains ttps by the

508
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,900
way misp is using uh the most important

509
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,520
standards for trade intelligence ticks

510
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,720
Taxi

511
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,440
and that's very easy to to be to get the

512
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,000
data in a structured way

513
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,659
uh then it is they can connect to

514
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,900
trusted providers trusted provider means

515
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,919
an Isaac as us or other sources so we'll

516
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,280
enable them to be more connected in the

517
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,080
threat intelligence world

518
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,539
and then they can just queries and

519
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,940
update the security controls based on

520
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,280
what they are seeing in in the

521
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,639
environment

522
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,440
's environment because

523
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,740
is for energy organizations energy

524
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,980
companies and they have huge OT or ICS

525
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,559
environments is and

526
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,780
most of the networks for example in our

527
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,820
reactors the networks are air gap you

528
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,919
cannot just you know from home I can do

529
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,280
configurations you know or maintenance

530
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,080
troubleshooting in my in my networks in

531
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,179
in the whole environment there are air

532
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,700
gap so what can I do I can just very

533
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,700
easily get the data on a USB go to a

534
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,919
security cache or you know security

535
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,100
Appliance scan it with multiple AVS you

536
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,080
know do whatever I want to from security

537
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,780
point of view and then I can get the

538
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,900
data in my air gap environment put in a

539
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,539
local Mist there and consume it because

540
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,780
in OT we have security controls and they

541
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,059
know about taxi they know about Stakes

542
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,039
they can they're able to consume threat

543
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,559
intelligence right and if somebody

544
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,860
thinks that air gap networks are very

545
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,780
well protected just because they are not

546
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,580
connected to the internet that's not

547
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,980
true just I just want to remember about

548
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,299
tax net and many other cases uh when air

549
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,340
gap networks were

550
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,480
um breached and not just Bridge as in

551
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,659
stats net case when they stop or they

552
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:51,179
actually modified some

553
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:54,900
parameters of a PLC no it's just it's

554
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,299
about also data exfiltration they can

555
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,600
exfiltrate data from air gap Networks

556
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,940
good

557
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,179
now because I kept this more catchy

558
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,280
slide for

559
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,419
um

560
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,960
as is just

561
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,120
for the final

562
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,700
part of my presentation because that

563
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,380
intelligence is about sharing and this

564
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,419
slide is increasing a little bit the

565
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,460
concerns that we should have in this

566
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,419
field

567
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,740
uh by the way manufacturing by is

568
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,620
something that is not Islam that I'm

569
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,679
saying is said by by many vendors in the

570
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,840
market manufacturing became

571
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,240
the most targeted industry after

572
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,380
in this year

573
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,120
usually for the last three four years

574
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,760
banking was the most targeted one but

575
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,220
now manufacturing is on the first place

576
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,039
and this is something that is changing

577
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,740
the role of the game because you know

578
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,900
the attackers said okay

579
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,539
banking is very well regulated they

580
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,460
invested a lot of money in cyber

581
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,679
security a lot of a lot of security

582
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,200
controls there but manufacturing and OT

583
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,100
iot ICS environments not too many

584
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,260
because if you are looking to the cyber

585
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,679
security market for OT security they are

586
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,559
teenagers right they just start Building

587
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,380
Solutions mature solutions for for for

588
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,500
protecting ICS environments

589
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,500
and energy and oil and gas together they

590
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,659
are on the fifth place this is something

591
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,320
that also is important to to to to to

592
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,400
see and take actions based on on such

593
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,799
information I mean like somebody which

594
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,240
has the decision power in an

595
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,220
organization when they see things like

596
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,140
this tomorrow they should start doing

597
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,520
something

598
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,860
and as you can see on the map we have

599
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,500
for example in Germany

600
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,860
in the first nine months of the year

601
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,179
from January to to September they had

602
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:03,960
four critical infrastructure compromised

603
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,860
by uh various uh threat actors I know

604
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,020
Rosner is a Russian company but they

605
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,000
breached the German Bridge the the

606
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,919
German office right

607
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,400
oil and tanking another one we have in

608
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,640
Japan because you might Denso right and

609
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,620
many many others and I can give you

610
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,500
Colonial pipeline example Samsung Toyota

611
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,100
twice in two years once we run somewhere

612
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,620
the second time was just a data breach

613
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,960
with the confidential data which was

614
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,159
exposed

615
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,799
and these are Big organizations they

616
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,840
know how to do cyber security but the

617
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,299
environment is pretty complex you need

618
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:46,500
to to see how you should put a cyber

619
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,320
security programming practice in a way

620
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,240
that it should be flexible because if a

621
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,799
procedure for example

622
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,640
he's saying look this this and this okay

623
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,919
in one year it will be Obsolete and by

624
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:02,960
the way something there are many uh

625
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,880
experts in the in in the field saying

626
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,640
that we should have an incident response

627
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,340
plan only for ransomware because it that

628
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,640
is another animal right if I'm following

629
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,840
the common IR procedure or plan that I

630
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,480
am using for business email compromise

631
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,000
that will not to work efficiently for

632
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,440
ransomware right because you know if I

633
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,559
in business May compromise maybe I if I

634
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,600
want to you know recover I should reset

635
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,400
some passwords but from my ransomware

636
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,799
the the recovery phase is totally

637
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,960
different

638
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,419
and in global organizations that think

639
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,039
is not easy to be implemented

640
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,159
and some predictions and statistics for

641
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,240
OT security

642
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,779
89 of manufacturing Oil and Gas and

643
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,360
energy compromise companies

644
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,520
have experienced cyber attacks in the

645
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,679
last 12 months 89 I know

646
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,539
in that group we put all the companies

647
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,480
around the globe or where we had the

648
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,419
military right Telemetry means Synergy

649
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,220
Isaac through the fees that we are

650
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,260
collecting from them from vendors or

651
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,059
public freed feeds but we are

652
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,320
aggregating them

653
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,240
the average cost of a cyber incidence

654
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,140
against OT is now 2.8 million is still

655
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,460
less than the average for uh a cyber

656
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,720
incident which

657
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,960
was like last year 3.4 million or

658
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,240
something like this

659
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,880
3.2.8 million is much is too much

660
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
honestly I mean I know ransomware and

661
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,260
paying the ransomware is increasing the

662
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,600
average cost is not just the cost to

663
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,659
recover or to mitigate an incident is

664
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,820
the overall cost that is being maybe you

665
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,500
need to shut down your plant that means

666
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,220
in for any energy

667
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,340
organizations means to start buying

668
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,840
energy from the market because you have

669
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,880
contracts and need to deliver it to the

670
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,100
to the to the clients right and so the

671
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,260
cost is increasing you know the is

672
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,240
actually double

673
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,899
in OT environments uh around 10 percent

674
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,500
of attacks are determined determined by

675
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,580
removal media uh devices it will say oh

676
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,500
man

677
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,419
how this is still happening very easily

678
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:30,059
because you have contractors you need to

679
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,659
get projects uh configuration files for

680
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,679
your plcs for your hbis they need to go

681
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,840
inside or the plant with some

682
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,140
documentation and other things right

683
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,799
and that is a risk that they are

684
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,440
bringing with with the USBs or removable

685
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,360
media they are bringing all The

686
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,880
Regulators for example in nuclear field

687
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,340
are saying that this is the biggest

688
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,220
threat that we should mitigate

689
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,120
and if we are comparing with it is three

690
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,679
times more that

691
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:10,620
uh is it is in it right so this is

692
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,919
something for OT that

693
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,860
uh you know the guys in in the room that

694
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,600
are working you know in uh OT

695
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,179
environments they should maybe go and

696
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,340
see how they should

697
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,440
modify the procedures update the

698
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,419
procedures that they they have in place

699
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,419
for for mitigating this

700
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,580
and the vulnerabilities in all the

701
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,580
environments they're representing uh 65

702
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,620
percent of total let's say that is not

703
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,980
possible no it's possible because for

704
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,940
example I don't know Microsoft Exchange

705
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,500
somebody identified a cve in 2020 but in

706
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,399
the next Tuesday patch it was mitigated

707
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,919
it's closed it's not reported anymore

708
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,220
right but in OT Siemens or Honeywell or

709
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,220
I don't know other vendors they not just

710
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,960
go and release a patch for a PLC or rtu

711
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,899
over the night they need to take time to

712
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,559
test it to see how the operations will

713
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,340
will be impacted and there are

714
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,140
situations and when they are deciding to

715
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,960
say will not patch it that's it please

716
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,679
apply other mitigations in in place to

717
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,200
to block the the exploitation of that

718
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,659
vulnerability and in this way

719
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,840
we come in this place where the 65

720
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,940
percent of the total vulnerabilities are

721
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,419
represented by OT vulnerabilities and by

722
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,200
the way

723
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,020
you may be and it's the case for all of

724
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,360
our organizations you cannot go and

725
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,658
replace

726
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,179
a digital system from your environment

727
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,120
emitter because it cost is passed first

728
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,460
of a system that is controlling a huge

729
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,740
processing in the organization and maybe

730
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,600
it costs like one million two million

731
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,299
stimulus I don't know up to 100 100

732
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,840
Millions

733
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,480
that was for today from my side uh I

734
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,460
just want to say one more thing

735
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,279
if in the room are other I don't know

736
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,159
representatives from organizations from

737
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,480
critical infrastructure organizations

738
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,360
from other domains or I don't know not

739
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,460
energy I know energy everybody's now

740
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,320
looking on the energy bill and is

741
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,539
talking about energy but Healthcare is

742
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,480
very important banking as I know we

743
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,580
don't have an ISAC in Romanian banking

744
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,340
for Romanian banking anybody who wants

745
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,899
to start a such initiative we can

746
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,500
discuss because the benefits are very

747
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,620
clear and the value added that the

748
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,960
members will see if they became a member

749
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,000
of an Isaac

750
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,860
thank you for spin

751
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,460
um guys let's have a handful question

752
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,779
[Applause]

753
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:01,260
do we have any questions in the audience

754
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,200
yes we do

755
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,980
coming this way

756
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,320
thank you for the great presentation uh

757
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,780
I have one question how do you manage

758
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,780
the trust in an aspect in motivating the

759
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,060
contributors to continue contributing

760
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,280
not only consuming

761
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,099
first is uh giving him feedback right

762
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,940
basic thing if somebody is contributing

763
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,020
and uh you know is valuable for example

764
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:35,040
no I'll give you very clear examples now

765
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,580
our members are not saying I saw this

766
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,800
incident happening in my environment I

767
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,780
want to contribute to it intelligence to

768
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,639
share with other members no they're

769
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,580
saying we saw in the wild happening this

770
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,418
not to me but I think it can happen to

771
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,639
the other members right and they are you

772
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,899
know contributing

773
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,119
we are giving him feedback saying okay

774
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,740
good because

775
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,520
most probably other members will see the

776
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,320
same the same behavior happening in

777
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,500
their environment or not but sooner or

778
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,079
later they will see somewhere in the

779
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,060
news or in other threat intelligence

780
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,280
fishing yeah is

781
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,400
I saw that and now I can say it was

782
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,980
valuable right and there are other yeah

783
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,000
please

784
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
okay

785
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,240
next question over here

786
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,740
yeah thank you great presentation

787
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,720
because Minnie and I'm glad somebody is

788
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,480
doing such a initiative in Romania just

789
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,280
wanted to add so I'm familiar with

790
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,880
Healthcare isak hi sac and uh how the

791
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,680
governance structure works and how they

792
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,020
have a board of directors that's

793
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,480
responsible for this how do you plan on

794
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,119
implementing in this one the governance

795
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,619
model and making sure as the previous

796
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,780
interviewer asked also making sure the

797
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,359
accountability and the Mandate is is

798
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,160
there so people can share use the

799
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,320
information and be active in the

800
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,599
community yeah we're taking the

801
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,940
advantage of using technical tools first

802
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,920
for sharing right Miss is allowing us to

803
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,700
Mark the data using TLP and that is easy

804
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,480
to say these users in the platform have

805
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,960
access only to TLP I don't know Amber or

806
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,320
below right so from this point of view

807
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,599
is pretty easy all right

808
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,700
uh from the government's point of view

809
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,980
we have a board of uh

810
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,359
the board of Isaac

811
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,579
we have a chairman with two years man

812
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,339
that mandate and it can be re-elected

813
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:48,119
third times he's like in democracy uh

814
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,320
but we're still in the development phase

815
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,660
uh we still need members now we are

816
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,079
discussing with other uh

817
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:59,040
organizations from Romanian energy

818
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,800
sector and we start looking also in the

819
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,060
region because we are members of

820
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,460
European energy they are very mature

821
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,940
they started in 2015.

822
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,099
and they encouraged us to take the

823
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,960
leadership in the region saying okay

824
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,380
what you are doing is nice let's go for

825
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,780
example in Bulgaria and say see if there

826
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,660
are energy organizations from there that

827
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,520
they want to become member in in your

828
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,420
Isaac or to help them to to develop a

829
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,280
local Isaac in Bulgaria and other

830
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,619
countries in the in the region

831
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,180
the governor's model is not really

832
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,880
easier we were used to have we have two

833
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,560
parts we have the capabilities we

834
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,500
present which is actually what we are

835
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,660
doing in the deliverables and some task

836
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,960
forces and we have the steering of

837
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,900
mechanism of this Isaac it is founded by

838
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,660
European Union okay so we still have

839
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,900
money one year uh after that maybe

840
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,760
nuclear electrical will continue to

841
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,320
support it for a while and then we'll uh

842
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,099
switch you know the entire is act on Ong

843
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,900
I mean

844
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,599
I will not dream when the will we are

845
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,420
doing what other guys are doing

846
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,780
okay so we have two questions gentlemen

847
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,900
on the left side so thank you for the

848
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,700
presentation

849
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,220
um I do have a couple of questions so

850
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,520
how do you deal with uh keeping the bad

851
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,380
indicators out you mentioned that

852
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,160
everybody is contributing

853
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
how you how you are keeping betting it

854
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,820
indicators out

855
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,980
from the misp

856
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,460
yeah from the mist from misp

857
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,220
how we are protecting the Mist no no how

858
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,060
are you doing filter out bad indicators

859
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:58,260
means low confidence yeah so usually all

860
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,480
those sources from where collecting data

861
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,040
the data is coming with a confidence

862
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,040
level then we have multiple phases

863
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,420
before we're delivering

864
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,460
we're analyzing it we're trying to see

865
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,280
if it is accurate we we can maintain the

866
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,079
confidence level or not if you are

867
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,060
decreasing the confidence level that

868
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,040
became inaccurate data let's say and

869
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,839
that will not be sent out to the to the

870
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,780
members okay so we have a process a

871
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,940
threat intelligence process starting

872
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,119
with collecting and no continual is

873
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,020
another analysis uh delivery and so on

874
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,960
and also what we have and what we

875
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,400
implemented is the prioritized

876
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,320
intelligence requirements because not

877
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,599
all the data is important for us as I

878
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,640
said we have only for example around

879
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,520
five thread groups that are important

880
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,200
for us and who are monitoring them

881
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,260
closely we don't want to delete the you

882
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,960
know the effort you know and spread the

883
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,540
focus on all the threat groups in the

884
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,680
world

885
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,160
awesome two other questions Luciano

886
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,980
hi thank you for the presentation I have

887
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,040
a question uh what is the Rel do you

888
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,960
have any relationship with because we we

889
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,060
have the NIS directive in Europe right

890
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,760
the network and infrastructure security

891
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,359
directive which mandates the creation of

892
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:23,640
scissors and uh uh NIS Authority uh and

893
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,619
also there's a Nissa at the European

894
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,980
level right so uh do you have a

895
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,079
relationship with the Romanian third or

896
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,000
whoever is the authority in Romania for

897
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,480
for this sector uh and also at the

898
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,020
European level with Vanessa and other

899
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,780
of other

900
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,640
similar organizations yeah sure first

901
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,320
when we started the project we got a

902
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,480
support letter from Romanian I I think

903
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,200
at that point was still Jetro and we got

904
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,960
a support letter from from them okay and

905
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,880
now we are doing for example uh uh in

906
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,579
common we are doing various for example

907
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,400
conferences trainings we are doing them

908
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,640
together and they are helping us to

909
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,400
develop this project we got very we got

910
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,200
very nice support from their side and

911
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,480
also at the European level we are in con

912
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
as I said we have a memorandum of

913
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,180
understanding with European energy Isaac

914
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,300
and using the end any size wall so yeah

915
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,060
we are in touch with all the most

916
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,560
important players

917
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,560
also uh as a comment uh Lucian at

918
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,200
European level Anissa is handling

919
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,099
Secretariat for the NIS committee they

920
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,140
are not uh

921
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,839
pushing out policies or something like

922
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,480
that the decisions are not made by Anisa

923
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,540
like made a board

924
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,220
of Representatives coming from all

925
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,160
member states and the agency that does

926
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,599
cyber security like on hands or

927
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,119
all the European Union or european

928
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,800
commission and European Parliament can

929
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,140
sell to you

930
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,700
foreign

931
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,280
no they're not coordinating

932
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,500
that that's actually the point the

933
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,220
member states take decisions and they

934
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,020
are ensuring that everyone has the same

935
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,420
data

936
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,480
okay if there are one more question here

937
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,820
and then we have some some questions

938
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,859
over here I wasn't thinking that my

939
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:30,300
presentation will arise a lot of

940
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,560
questions

941
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,400
uh very nice presentation thanks for it

942
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,579
um you mentioned earlier that uh at

943
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,619
least for now you prioritize what's

944
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,020
relevant and important as a threat for

945
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,060
you yeah and you also also mention

946
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,000
stocksnet which was a basis for a lot of

947
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,180
other attacks in different fields uh

948
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,000
recently the Chilean Observatory was

949
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,640
attacked I was wondering if you'll Also

950
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,859
let's say expand to a more General view

951
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:02,280
because a lot of malware or threat

952
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,579
actors adapt and reuse something from

953
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:09,480
one domain or field to another yeah we

954
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,099
have ransomware as a service for example

955
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:14,220
right and the various modules of a piece

956
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,500
of malware can be reused by other thread

957
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,260
groups but as I said we are trying to

958
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,380
see what are the thread groups that we

959
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,839
want to keep in monitoring mode right

960
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,280
even if they are using pieces from other

961
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,960
campaigns or other thread groups or you

962
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,180
know they have similarities yeah that

963
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,839
can be done but we don't want to we want

964
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:39,900
to keep our focus on what is important

965
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,200
for us right that this is the

966
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,980
let's say a very important thing that we

967
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,619
want to to keep in place so last

968
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:53,700
question here uh and after this I'm

969
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,140
going to have to ask you to please

970
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,220
approach husband in the break and ask

971
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,200
him whatever you feel like so last

972
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,400
question

973
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,420
thank you

974
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,400
but the global level the way of

975
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,880
improving security is by having

976
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,180
transparency on breaches and on

977
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,560
vulnerabilities and this would trigger

978
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,720
to improve the security at the other

979
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,220
side of the Spectrum in Romania

980
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,200
everybody is praising how good we are

981
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,980
and how experts we are but not sharing

982
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,319
our vulnerabilities and our breaches

983
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,599
what do you think we should do in order

984
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,359
to learn from the global practices or

985
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:32,700
they should learn from us yeah the most

986
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,380
important thing is to create the right

987
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,400
context

988
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,740
for if you don't trust somebody you'll

989
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,660
not be transparent right I cannot be

990
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,579
candid with somebody that I cannot trust

991
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,880
right so the Isaac is this is the maybe

992
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,260
the most important thing we are trying

993
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,240
to create the context for other

994
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,200
organizations in the same sector to

995
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,839
trust others right to have com this is

996
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,640
communities of communities trusted

997
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,980
communities of community of communities

998
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,520
sorry but we are trying and it's very

999
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,460
easy because I mean I I wasn't expecting

1000
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,900
to see you know this

1001
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,260
level of transparency from the members

1002
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,200
but they saw the benefits I'm saying if

1003
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,599
I'm not I'm not contributing I will not

1004
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:22,020
get you know what I need from from the

1005
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,140
member from the other members right and

1006
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,140
