1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,319
welcome to this gig that I was somehow

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,340
tricked into doing for some reason

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:08,940
um

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,860
I kept it a little bit low touch because

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,259
I really wanted to get the audience

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,400
engaged and I'd like to kick it off with

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,380
so the presidency the presentation is

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,820
called the secret source of cyber

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,500
security operations

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,439
so I'd like to start with what's the

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,619
difference between cyber security

12
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:31,140
gotcha it's not going to do that

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,940
um

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,820
let's start over a little bit of I'm

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,380
very nervous because it's the first time

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,820
that I've done this in front of such a

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,379
huge audience so if you want to grab a

18
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,719
coffee like by all means like I'll have

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,980
five people in the room and be really

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,300
happy about it

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,879
so who am I

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:48,960
um

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,300
18 years in activity 14 in cyber

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,120
security for the past almost eight years

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,820
I've done cyber security operations

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,920
so apparently people

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,480
saw like think that they know what I'm

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,860
talking about all have to see

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,860
um I'm what I used I call myself a cozy

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,979
host for the Imposter syndrome because

31
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,439
like in this type of activity you always

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,320
think that like you're the lowest person

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,060
and like everybody else is better than

34
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,740
you so if you're in the room and you

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,540
feel the same you're not alone so this

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,400
is a call out to everybody I've actually

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,900
heard people

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,540
uh on the floor and elsewhere talking

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,640
about this thing so yeah

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,979
being a people leader for a significant

41
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,140
amount of time one some of the things

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,840
that really resonated with me

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,439
um are servant leadership so my role as

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,659
a people leader is to actually enable

45
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,320
the people that I'm responsible for to

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,380
work and be productive

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,500
um

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,780
and I I strive to do that and one of the

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,700
things that I think many organizations

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,979
are lacking is the whole start with why

51
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,619
which is a Simon signing concept and I

52
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,200
really like so

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,500
and the last piece of information is I'm

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,300
a

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,520
driver enthusiasts so this is like a

56
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,220
mask off mask on type of moment so I

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,500
really enjoy this is my my moment to

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
disconnect from everything so like I go

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,220
on the track and like I

60
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,599
don't care for anything about eight

61
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,400
hours until my children call but that's

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,319
a different story

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,060
so

64
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,980
in the line of starting why why the

65
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,480
presentation

66
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,400
um

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,980
in these types of conventions you hear a

68
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,480
lot of discussions about the latest

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,700
techniques the latest stuff that happens

70
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,260
the latest exploits the latest

71
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,360
misconfigurations you don't hear a lot

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,580
about the people that are in the first

73
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,319
line of defense the people in operations

74
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,540
the like

75
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,640
let's call them the foot soldiers if you

76
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,599
want

77
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,700
and what I try to do in this

78
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,700
presentation so it's just a summary of

79
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,680
maybe some not the most but some of the

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,239
most important lessons that I've learned

81
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,680
in my professional life

82
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,220
uh why because first of all I hope it

83
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,379
will help the people that the corporate

84
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,260
world calls the individual contributors

85
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,300
but I also hope that this will help

86
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,180
their managers and it will enable to

87
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,459
maybe change a little bit their mindset

88
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,680
and also the stakeholders and policy

89
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,620
makers and while this mostly applies to

90
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,200
service providers which have these

91
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,319
significant operations

92
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,360
hope it works

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,739
um

94
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,900
I think it also applies to people that

95
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,280
are responsible for internal security

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,200
teams of different sizes

97
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,379
we're going to talk about five cases

98
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,260
um it's not going to be it's going to be

99
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,480
a mix so we it's not like one person

100
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,760
everything's anonymized and everything's

101
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,040
like coincidental or not

102
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,560
but hopefully this will be helpful for

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,060
you and we're going to start with the

104
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,459
first case which we're going to call the

105
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,200
first story The gutting case of civil

106
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,640
Shepherd I don't know if you know her

107
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,260
she used to be a big hit when I was like

108
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,659
really tiny so if you don't know her

109
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,720
like midnight color and a lot

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,560
so Sybil was the fresh college graduate

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,680
um civil had no real work experience and

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,660
at least in Romania

113
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,080
this is a non-starter for most Tas so

114
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,300
like hey I'm fresh out of college like

115
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,520
we don't care what's your experience you

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,340
need to have four senses and five other

117
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,840
certifications to be considered for

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,759
junior positions so thank you very much

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,919
no

120
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,360
um yeah

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,979
actually there was a really difficult

122
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,800
housing situation involved as well so

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,419
civil

124
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,180
came and discussed with the people in

125
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,560
the organization that we're talking

126
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,300
about

127
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,780
and civil was an absolutely brilliant

128
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,940
cyber security professional I mean think

129
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,880
Matrix think how NEOS is in The Matrix

130
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,820
that's how civil sees in

131
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,580
all the code in the world so I think red

132
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,979
Reddington if you if you watch a

133
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,560
blacklist when he talks about Demby he

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,900
says he's Splendid so that was civil

135
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,280
Shepherd I mean look at her seriously

136
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,000
um

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,240
why is it a gutting case because Sybil

138
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,800
got hired and it got a what

139
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,820
um civil got hired so uh spent a good

140
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,560
period of time but unfortunately the

141
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,960
organizational where Sybil got hurt was

142
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,820
not actually prepared for the talent

143
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,780
that

144
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,240
she brought to the table so

145
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,880
Sybil had to actually leave to a place

146
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,860
that was far more far far more suitable

147
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,139
for the skill set and

148
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,660
um it is what it is

149
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,759
so Sybil comes with a with a really

150
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,060
really important lesson for you as

151
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,240
individual contributors you as managers

152
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,280
and your stakeholders

153
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,039
if you love something set it free and

154
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,560
there's a small here it says if it

155
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,000
doesn't come back hunted down and kill

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,240
it but like I'll leave it at that

157
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,360
um

158
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,820
as a as a manager myself

159
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,880
I strongly encourage you to be happy

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,340
when somebody says hey I'm going to

161
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,560
pursue another opportunity because it

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,840
helps me fulfill my dream it will make

163
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,360
you a lot more accomplished than saying

164
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,100
oh I have this challenge I have to have

165
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,960
find a back hill for a backfield for

166
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,180
this person the market is

167
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,699
another entity doesn't help me and

168
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,680
everybody asks for a lot of money like

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
if you love something set it free

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,800
because

171
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,259
it'll make you grow as a person it's not

172
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,000
the easiest thing to do but we don't

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,900
take it easy path

174
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,940
the second story is we're going to call

175
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,860
it the metamorphic case of Polo tradis

176
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,960
and because if you if you read June I've

177
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,199
read you know like a million times uh

178
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,360
before it was a thing I think

179
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,280
some old

180
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,220
um so Paula Chinese had many many like

181
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,800
access to many ancestries because when

182
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,139
he took the spice he became prescient

183
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,539
and so on so this is a story of many

184
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:13,380
people

185
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,900
you may be in this role you may have

186
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,180
been in this role Paul may be a former

187
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,800
government employee he may be an

188
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,599
employee at the end job and perhaps he

189
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
wants to dabble into cyber security for

190
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,020
the first time he comes into

191
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,819
organization spends one to three years

192
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,220
in the organization and then wants to

193
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,259
experience something else and kudos to

194
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,539
them I love a person that is going to

195
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,340
say hey

196
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,139
I know it's like for example former

197
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,060
government employees saying hey it's my

198
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,639
first uh encounter with the corporate

199
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,319
world I want to try something else

200
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,960
please don't hold it against me don't

201
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,060
hold it against them

202
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,680
Paul

203
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,800
insert whatever time you want gives you

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,539
a phone call and says hey

205
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,380
it's not really what was sold to me 88

206
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,880
sorry

207
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,080
um and I'd really like to come back so

208
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,539
uh I see my wife she's like oh my God I

209
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,940
can't believe she's saying that so he

210
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,860
reaches out to you and says hey I want

211
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,560
to come back so

212
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,919
dear cyber security managers

213
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,440
sometimes the grass is greener on the

214
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,460
other side because it's fed with

215
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,660
something that I'm not allowed to say

216
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,819
because I represent the company but you

217
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,319
know what I mean

218
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,520
um

219
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,860
for you as individual contributors do

220
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,039
not shy away from that do not if you've

221
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,500
had a good relationship with your former

222
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,320
manager do not shy away from picking up

223
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,179
the phone and saying hey

224
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,799
help me if you can

225
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,020
because if you have a good manager and

226
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,720
this is where the the we separate the

227
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,459
grain from the chaff

228
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,519
they're going to help you

229
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,399
for you cyber security managers manifest

230
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,600
empathy

231
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,899
put yourself in their shoes and think

232
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,580
about what you're doing their faith in

233
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,220
in their in their shoes so help them

234
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,200
you may not have the role you may know

235
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,459
somebody who has the role you may

236
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,680
facilitate but again grow yourselves as

237
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,740
managers and it'll prove

238
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,940
better in the long term

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,640
the third story we're going to call it

240
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,200
the Intriguing case of Captain Thor Iron

241
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
Hulk and this I I I couldn't for my life

242
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,459
depended I couldn't draw a circle so

243
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,660
this is something that I actually found

244
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,899
online

245
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,700
um

246
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,060
Marvel

247
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,660
so

248
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,540
Captain Thor ironhulk had a couple of

249
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,820
interviews with a certain organization

250
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,980
the interviews were like really crappy

251
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,839
the feedback that he got

252
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,320
were like he can't he really decide what

253
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,019
he is is he a green Beast is he well

254
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,260
captain of justice is he a Norse god so

255
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,040
it's like such a bad candidate

256
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,720
he doesn't even know the name of a

257
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,640
single vendor

258
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,860
of a web proxy solution like come on

259
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,080
Websense

260
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,240
blue scope whatever I don't care

261
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,980
and this is actually one of the stories

262
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,720
that's like the nearest and nearest to

263
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,760
my heart because I got to actually talk

264
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,519
to Captain Thor ironhawk and he's

265
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,459
awesome I mean

266
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,160
you get to a point where you start to

267
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,200
sense that something's like beneath the

268
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,839
surface and you try to explore it and

269
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,240
Captain Thor ironhog says hey I don't

270
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,779
know the name of a web proxy solution

271
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,399
but I actually have my own engines

272
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,140
instance that I've put in my lab at home

273
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,519
it's like hmm

274
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,320
tell me about your lab at home like it

275
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,880
has an ideas and it has this and that

276
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,740
and I'm actually blocking my wife's

277
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,760
shopping Habits Like I'm sorry honey but

278
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,620
uh Zara is down or whatever it's like

279
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,899
this is one of the situations where if

280
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,779
you're a good people reader if you're a

281
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,640
manager that understands the cyber

282
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,740
security landscape you're going to have

283
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,200
that person hired on the spot

284
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,260
so Captain Thor ironhawk

285
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,660
turns out that he's a really dependable

286
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,360
fire and forget down-to-earth operations

287
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,240
person I really like I really like to

288
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,920
surround myself with fire and forget

289
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,920
people what I mean by that is like we

290
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,260
have stuff to do if I assign somebody

291
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,839
like hey help me with this I'm not the

292
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,000
kind of person that will double check

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,680
every two days that something has been

294
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,140
progressed we will talk about this in

295
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,300
three months or two weeks or next year

296
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,339
but I know that this type of person is a

297
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:36,839
person that I can depend on that when

298
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,399
the time comes they would have done

299
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,320
their own job surround yourself with

300
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,079
these types of people and strive to be

301
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,940
this kind of people like managers and

302
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,180
contributors because it's a much leaner

303
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,300
a much much much better solution to to

304
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,660
workplace relationships if you ask me

305
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,399
and Captain Thor I don't know because

306
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,200
like he has some cycle

307
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,100
Magical Hammer unbreakable Shield power

308
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,560
armor and invincibility he's one of the

309
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,839
people that I very much like to have

310
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,519
around during syrians incident and

311
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,700
this is like you hire people strive to

312
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,320
find the potential in people and to tap

313
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,820
it and you're going to be surprised and

314
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,140
you're going to grow you're going to be

315
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,100
better

316
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,740
so the lesson that

317
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,160
the Chimera brings to to the story

318
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,140
actually there are two lessons so first

319
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,120
of all higher the wise the why not the

320
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,220
wise like you have a challenge like hey

321
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,380
what do you think about this there there

322
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,360
will be people that will say why not

323
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,519
let's try this crazy idea say see what

324
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,140
have what comes out of it

325
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,760
there will be people saying like why

326
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,620
it's disruptive I don't like it I don't

327
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,019
care about this higher the why not

328
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,620
strive to be the why Nots because

329
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,519
we work in cyber security we're not

330
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,519
in we're not making bread even though

331
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,320
there's Innovation so

332
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,160
keto bread

333
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,880
the second lesson is change is

334
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,860
inevitable the people that are the why

335
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,540
not are going to be better adapted to

336
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,420
the change and if there's anything that

337
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,579
people that have spent a lot of a lot of

338
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,500
time in the industry is change is

339
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,959
inevitable except from a vending machine

340
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,320
that's like use the

341
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,620
the ones with the car

342
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,420
the fourth story we're going to call it

343
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,399
the unwavering case of geralt of Rivia

344
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,040
this comes with a lesson also from

345
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,459
from The Blacklist so if you like The

346
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,040
Blacklist I like The Blacklist so

347
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
so girls

348
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,079
is again it's a Persona it exemplifies

349
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,839
many people by the nature of the Beast

350
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,820
that come from really toxic environments

351
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,980
and you give them a chance

352
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,560
um some come from companies that have

353
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,380
really bad cultures some come from

354
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,180
other places that don't have such a

355
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,779
great culture

356
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,540
he tried so many times they tried so

357
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,399
many times to join organization but

358
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,380
didn't really work out for them

359
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,839
so I mean as it says here in this

360
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,040
respect it's more like Captain America

361
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,600
than geralt

362
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,880
um with geralt was like 30 chance of

363
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,420
making it out alive so anyway

364
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,120
maybe not a really

365
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,700
good choice of a persona but he was

366
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,560
given a chance and he became one of the

367
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,779
most Dependable loyal and high

368
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,399
performing employee of that organization

369
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,920
and I think that

370
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,979
um

371
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,120
it's a really difficult conversation one

372
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,040
that may be

373
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,880
um

374
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,220
subject of like coffee elsewhere

375
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,160
because in this day and age we talk a

376
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
lot about

377
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,180
this is just a job

378
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,040
but on the other hand

379
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,079
I think it's really important for an

380
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,220
employee

381
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,860
to be loyal and to them to to the

382
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,380
organization and for the organization to

383
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,500
be loyal to an employee Facebook sorry

384
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,100
the allergies they're crushing me

385
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
um

386
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,880
yeah I think because

387
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,980
a person that's invested like look at

388
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,260
what happens in Ukraine and how a good

389
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,959
people leader has managed to to gather

390
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,839
around and to really rally the people

391
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,000
against an external enforcement why

392
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,180
loyalty is so important and

393
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,940
we need to try to to make this it's a

394
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,440
two-way street it's not like oh the

395
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,639
employees are loyal to the companies

396
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,860
like no it doesn't work like that it is

397
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,500
always a two-way street and

398
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,860
if an employee is loyalty to a company

399
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,779
is

400
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,959
not so obvious the other way around it

401
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,820
makes the news and it's going to create

402
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,380
a really bad reputation no matter how

403
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,240
much money you throw at people if you

404
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,920
have a bad reputation people are not

405
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,800
going to come you need to behave in a

406
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,219
certain way

407
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,740
so the fourth story this is there's a

408
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,899
really slow it's a really cool video but

409
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,180
I I couldn't put it here when red

410
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,820
explains about loyalty and how he worked

411
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,980
to putting carpets in a very hot summer

412
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,279
when he was really really young Google

413
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,680
it read value loyalty you'll see it it's

414
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,920
a really impressive demonstration from

415
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,320
from James Spader but yeah value loyalty

416
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,519
Above All Else

417
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,880
do not deceive to not

418
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,339
light your employees

419
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,260
it's better to tell them I'm not at

420
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,760
Liberty to say than to lie

421
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,500
the fifth Story

422
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,100
it's again a persona it's we're going to

423
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,420
call it the frustrating case of

424
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,100
Cassandra

425
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,320
Cassandra the priest of the the

426
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,079
Priestess Apollo Priestess from like the

427
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,120
ancient times I think it was Apollo

428
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,800
maybe

429
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,660
um should predict the fall of stray

430
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,000
should predict a lot of stuff but nobody

431
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,680
would listen to her

432
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,019
so

433
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,880
there are many Cassandras in cyber

434
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,830
security that's the reality of things

435
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,109
[Music]

436
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,900
and I'd like to to have a show of hands

437
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,000
so I'm the of the opinion

438
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,640
that cyber security is one of the very

439
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,740
very few areas short of a kinetic

440
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,839
conflict that we have up north where

441
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,880
human intelligence actually is at war

442
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,619
with human intelligence like do you

443
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,439
agree with this statement I do I do

444
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,199
it's like you battle adversaries you try

445
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,120
to evict adversaries you try to outsmart

446
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,679
them you try to do stuff to them they

447
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,960
try to do stuff to you on a daily basis

448
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,400
this is unheard of this doesn't happen

449
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,039
in I.T operations and unless you

450
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,320
you are a fan of the rise of the robots

451
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
or something else

452
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,240
so I think it's really important I I

453
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,700
don't I I think that many organizations

454
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,059
do not do a

455
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,720
a good job at recognizing the Cassandras

456
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,280
in the organization actually enabling

457
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,140
and empowering them they're going to say

458
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,299
hey I have a strategy

459
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,559
um you're not going to come and append

460
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,900
it because you're stupid ideas like ah

461
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,940
go play in your sandbox

462
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,440
so

463
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,960
Cassandra is many people that are not

464
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,460
listened by the stakeholders this is

465
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,500
more lessons about stakeholders and

466
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,400
about

467
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
the people that actually do the work

468
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,700
um there's a saying from one of the

469
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,620
mentors that I have that says I'm too

470
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,880
busy shooting girls to talk to the

471
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,740
machine gun salesperson

472
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,919
so it's like yeah we have to fight these

473
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,080
alerts and they're like trillions like

474
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,700
maybe we could do this and there are no

475
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,980
more alerts like ah you're stalking

476
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,140
 sorry

477
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,460
um

478
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,760
so if you're in that role create

479
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,100
listening posts nurture Innovation

480
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,980
culture I've seen and it's not only a a

481
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,260
feature of cyber security it's also in

482
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,400
many walks of life uh

483
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,840
many people many many organizations

484
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,020
consider that Innovation is the

485
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,380
privilege of like their r d Department

486
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,840
some of you may know the story about the

487
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,880
rear spoiler from the dachiometrics

488
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,220
which was like somebody invented the way

489
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,140
to make it cheaper they were like they

490
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,539
took their idea and now he sued them and

491
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,640
got millions of dollars so Innovation is

492
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,039
not the privilege of few many people in

493
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,380
your organizations can have ideas that

494
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,940
are brilliant and awesome

495
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,919
so create listening pause give people 20

496
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,780
of me time

497
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,140
try to enforce this try to encourage

498
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,760
them to do the work that they care about

499
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,340
the the lesson that Cassandra brings

500
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,039
comes from left Tolstoy we're in peace

501
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,720
the strongest of Warriors are these two

502
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,520
time and patience it's a lesson for you

503
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
that have these ideas and are not being

504
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,940
listened to and if your ideas are not

505
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,100
listened to start your own gig but it's

506
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,740
like written really slow because I'm I

507
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,600
don't know how the message sounds so

508
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,820
follow your dreams follow your ideas

509
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,100
so that was the bulk of the presentation

510
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,720
I do have a couple of Kudos and call

511
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,280
outs that are going to take me like 30

512
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,240
seconds

513
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,860
so first of all I'd like to thank the

514
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,679
organization that made this possible and

515
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,120
I'd like to invite with me on the stage

516
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,220
Andrei

517
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,960
please

518
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,120
so in our organization we've actually

519
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,360
created a challenge coin

520
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,000
that we give to all the people that

521
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,419
have been serving the cyber security

522
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,400
Community for a long time therefore our

523
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,679
Champions they're for the people that no

524
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,260
no no no no no no why so it has a lot of

525
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,660
it has a lot of Easter eggs that I'm

526
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,640
sure you're gonna have fun thank you for

527
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,679
all the partnership in the past I don't

528
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,780
know how many years and yeah too many

529
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,960
and we hope we'll see you next time

530
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,679
thank you

531
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,640
the second call out is to the people in

532
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,400
the trenches I know your jobs are really

533
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,500
difficult so

534
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,539
help us try to make them better because

535
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,340
the ideas come from actually doing the

536
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,679
work from making the machine guns better

537
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,419
for making the tanks better for making

538
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,860
everything better

539
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,059
and um

540
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,120
the third the last but not the least

541
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,600
important call out is to my better half

542
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,260
thank you

543
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,960
thank you thank you very much Andre are

544
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,280
there any questions for Andre

545
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,740
if not I would have fun

546
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,520
I read about a lot of experience you

547
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,100
have in um

548
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,640
managing people or searching for people

549
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,059
or trying to support them in their

550
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,980
growth

551
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,880
and I've read that you have a large team

552
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,059
of L3 security specialists

553
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,120
and the question would be which would be

554
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,419
the most

555
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:14,820
valuable skills on L3 Specialists should

556
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,460
have the most what the most valuable

557
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,600
valuable skill

558
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,820
the the mindset

559
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,600
it's not a skill it's like

560
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,340
think

561
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,340
have a growth mindset

562
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,559
it's there are some people that will

563
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,260
know like hey I know I'm I'm a person

564
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,419
I'm a forensicator I know how to do

565
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,220
forensics like that's great but

566
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,780
forensics may be gone tomorrow because

567
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,580
somebody's going to invent an AI thing

568
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,900
that's going to do everything and you're

569
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,419
gonna be redundant like what what do you

570
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,280
put instead think

571
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,120
fast have a growth mindset

572
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,000
I've had people

573
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,820
hired with almost no cyber security

574
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,059
experience and they've they've become

575
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,159
extraordinary

576
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,140
that's the most valuable thing that you

577
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,480
can bring to the table it's not hey I

578
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,100
know because

579
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,960
and it's also a skill that does not a

580
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,659
skill that does not depreciate uh Don

581
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,539
Smith who talked last year is like he

582
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,679
has a quote he says like uh in cyber

583
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,960
security live for a day Everything

584
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,880
Changes live for live for a year

585
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,980
everything's the same

586
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,640
so I quote him it's not very about him

587
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,120
but your mind said the way that you

588
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,919
approach a problem is your most

589
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,240
important skill set it doesn't matter

590
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,940
like exploits will come and go

591
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,919
techniques will come and go but

592
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,799
being flexible being the why not

593
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,780
is the most important thing that I

594
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,400
personally look for in these people

595
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,320
because they're the people that when

596
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,360
when the tides change and in cyber

597
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,280
security Tides change these are the

598
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,880
people that will be the best suited to

599
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,059
to make sure that we keep defending the

600
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,220
people that we keep defending that's my

601
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,520
take on things okay thank you

602
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,020
thanks everybody

603
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,740
thank you
