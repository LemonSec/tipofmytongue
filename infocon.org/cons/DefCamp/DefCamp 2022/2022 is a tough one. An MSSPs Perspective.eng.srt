1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,340
I'm a cyber security with expert

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,680
romanias and I'm a cyber security with

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,020
expert Romania this is what four coffees

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,340
does to you to your ability to speak

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,480
early in the AM

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,940
some of you might know me

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,839
others please patience

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,359
perspective a brief perspective I take

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,460
it because we're out of time

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,340
even before starting on

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,820
how we we as a managed security services

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
provider orange Business Services have

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,340
dealt with 2022 so far

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,980
because 2022 has been a very very rough

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,218
year

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,660
this is actually a touch screen I like

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,839
it

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,620
I'm gonna go through the context of 2022

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,600
I'm going to talk to you about some of

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,399
the attacks the attackers and the

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,719
targets

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,239
and of course I'm going to end with

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,100
predictions because any business

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,319
presentation should have some type of

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,420
prediction on this on the last slide

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,080
even though they never pan out

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,679
ever

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,540
so for most managed Security Services

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,280
providers such as orange Business

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,420
Services

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,020
a common year it's mostly like a

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,000
you have your UPS you have your downs

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,799
and of course the in-betweens you have

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,320
some malware campaigns and then you

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,479
maybe have a period of Silence where you

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,640
regroup when you learn some new ttps

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,759
when you update your stuff your uh your

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,220
processes your knowledge

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,040
and then of course well

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,540
uh you might bump into another period of

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,060
um intense activity when it comes to

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,520
attacks

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,360
this has been 2022 so far

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,399
um it it is it still is

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
unfortunately a mix of all things that

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,100
could have went gone wrong

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,920
uh squared

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,119
so

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,480
for a

50
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,040
run-of-the-mill

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,099
you know company that

52
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,840
wants to

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,360
wants to have some sort of cyber

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,459
security services offered by a third

55
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,379
party

56
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,420
um the process in itself should be

57
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,060
transparent should be pain-free should

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,239
be mostly click and go should be a a a a

59
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,420
a easy onboarding process and then

60
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,940
everything it's it's hands off

61
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,440
not this year

62
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,180
because this year has brought a new

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,940
context something that we didn't

64
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,239
actually had the chance to uh to align

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,319
with

66
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,540
and this is mostly because of the

67
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,019
previous two years you might remember

68
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,180
covid-19 that's still a thing and it was

69
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,239
during 2020 and 2021

70
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,739
and this post-pandemic context brought a

71
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,959
very new and Lush environment for

72
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,300
attackers for malicious actors and the

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,220
like to deal with

74
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,159
you had a lot of new technologies in the

75
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,739
perimeter because everyone had to move

76
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,500
to their office in their in their homes

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,780
you had a lot of new tools you had a lot

78
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,099
of new software you had a lot of new

79
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,319
processes everything was ripe and ready

80
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,040
to be well honestly taken down

81
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,620
and then you have the new tools because

82
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,260
everything moves to a

83
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,780
service perspective right everything is

84
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,459
service oriented everything is

85
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,099
more or less a service offering when it

86
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,099
comes to malicious tools

87
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,680
right you have ransomware as a service

88
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,680
providers

89
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,200
you you actually pay a monthly

90
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,080
subscription in order to have access to

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
a command and control center that allows

92
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,099
you to exploit vulnerable

93
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:08,159
vulnerable assets using some type of

94
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,560
malware right that is readily available

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,379
within that platform and then you have

96
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,680
the ability to collect you know your

97
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,220
your gains your Ransom or to wipe

98
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,860
everything off at the click of a button

99
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,180
this is scary

100
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,139
but it is the new it is a new reality it

101
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,479
is a new context that we have to grow uh

102
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,120
accustomed to and it is something that

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,860
most managed security services provider

104
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,540
have to deal with

105
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,300
on the long term

106
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,919
and then

107
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,960
completely unexpected you have the

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,900
geopolitics you have the West attacking

109
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,940
the east or actually responding to the

110
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,479
to attacks from the East you have state

111
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,840
actors that for the better part of of

112
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,720
the past 20 years or so we're not

113
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,880
necessarily interested in Romania it's

114
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,740
not that they are now you know it's not

115
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,540
that something happened overnight and

116
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,300
and out of nowhere Romania has become a

117
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,960
ripe Target for State actors from Iran

118
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,320
or China it's just that everything is

119
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,320
cyber warfare Warfare now everything is

120
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,160
attack and well for the better part of

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,620
uh of our services defense

122
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,560
this has been 2022 in a nutshell right

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,100
so far

124
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,979
starting off with January log for J I

125
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,580
presume it rings a bell right you some

126
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,340
some of you might have spent some very

127
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,340
very late nights doing

128
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,940
inventory and auditing Assets in order

129
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,820
to just get a glance get a better

130
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,620
understanding of on what is the attack

131
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,120
surface for the lock for J in your

132
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
Enterprises

133
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,060
but that mostly dialed down by uh by uh

134
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,580
mid-spring right you automated the tools

135
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,860
you automated the response to some

136
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,360
extent you've patch everything you

137
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,440
updated most of most of your stuff

138
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,919
we are now okay right and for the uh for

139
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,180
orange Business Services Business

140
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,220
Internet Security

141
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,080
um

142
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,419
manage detection and response types of

143
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,520
services we are definitely seeing a

144
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,080
um increase when it comes to the

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,400
preventive and protective measures that

146
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,500
have been taken regarding Long 4J in our

147
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,639
customers base

148
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,900
and then you have DDOS

149
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,759
which as you might see from those very

150
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,819
nicely drawn circles then there

151
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,479
was a thing somewhere mid-april the

152
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,639
Press was talking about DDOS attacks

153
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,660
mostly coming from Russia or from China

154
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,759
targeting some governmental

155
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,039
infrastructure targeting some private

156
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,979
entities but this is DDOS it's

157
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:03,419
unsophisticated I know it hurts but it's

158
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,940
still unsophisticated it's extremely

159
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,340
extremely low yield it's just High noise

160
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,840
right

161
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,280
malware was a constant a constant and

162
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,720
and very very tiring

163
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,680
uh type of uh of um activity to deal

164
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,860
with from a from an mssp's perspective

165
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,419
uh we had malware campaigns ranging from

166
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,500
um mobile malware spread through SMS

167
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,539
through SMS messages we had if I

168
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,979
remember correctly we had two such

169
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,819
campaigns and one one was in the fourth

170
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,240
quarter of 2022 2021 followed shortly by

171
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,380
another one in in the beginning of 2022

172
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,979
um

173
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,620
and we've seen some other type of

174
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,220
activity which I'm going to go into

175
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,400
early early summer in the early summer

176
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,099
and then you have fake news you have

177
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,039
this information you have psyops and and

178
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,319
the previous speaker actually did an

179
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,020
amazing job of just pointing out how

180
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,060
this

181
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,620
um

182
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,780
this type of human vulnerability could

183
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,300
can actually be exploited in a technical

184
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,860
standpoint right

185
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,740
you have fake news and we still do deal

186
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,500
with fake news ranging from

187
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,979
um kovi 19 kovi 19 related stuff at the

188
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,700
beginning of the year to more contextual

189
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,779
and more topical things as of now may

190
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,899
some of you might remember that in the

191
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,860
beginning of the spring

192
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,300
some of us received recruitment letters

193
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,959
from various fake

194
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,100
Army officials

195
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,420
in in our area that that type of

196
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,660
disinformation was initially spread to

197
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,380
um to the internet

198
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,180
going back to what we actually do and

199
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,300
how we managed to observe these things

200
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,459
orange Business Services is one of the

201
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:17,880
largest mssp in Romania

202
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,000
we do provide services for more than 400

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,640
companies ranging from smes to large

204
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Enterprises although we are heavily

205
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,220
vested to the large Enterprises

206
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,980
we do protect tens of thousands of

207
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,880
assets and our services range from

208
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,640
managed IPS and IDs is to security

209
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
operations centers

210
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,980
we do have the capability to collect and

211
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,399
then to and then to analyze these

212
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,560
um well

213
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,880
um you know

214
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,980
um

215
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,779
breadcrumbs and translate the

216
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,160
breadcrumbs into actual insights and

217
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,219
um intelligence

218
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,880
and this is some of the things that

219
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,459
we've been seeing since the the start of

220
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,899
the year

221
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,160
a increase in ransomware and in DDOS but

222
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,940
the Dos was mostly on low hanging fruits

223
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,760
I do remember and I I do remember that

224
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,880
one time in April one

225
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,640
one of the websites when airport the

226
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,620
Romanian airport was taken down for

227
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,800
nearly two hours by a DDOS attack

228
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,899
two hours

229
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,300
can you imagine a website with maybe

230
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,060
four visitors each year being taken down

231
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,519
for two hours for two entire hours well

232
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,100
so DDOS is mostly low hanging fruits

233
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,880
DDOS is mostly noise and very very low

234
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,360
yield for attackers but it has increased

235
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,940
year over year since 2021 and it has

236
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,560
we did recognize some activity in our

237
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,420
customers infrastructures

238
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,500
right

239
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,600
and I think that the largest observed

240
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,540
DDOS peaked at some 120 gigabytes per

241
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,620
second

242
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,560
that's I I don't it might sound scary it

243
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,899
actually isn't

244
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,779
the better part of these attacks more

245
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,940
than 90 percent of all observers that

246
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,640
observed attacks are opportunity attacks

247
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,620
they are not targeted they are not

248
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,600
sufficiently targeted at least they

249
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,500
don't have a uh you know a definitive

250
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,980
goal in in affecting one or another

251
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,140
customer or entity it's mostly

252
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,060
everything that's visible and it's up

253
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,579
for grabs the attackers try to actually

254
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,560
take it

255
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,720
some nine percent of the attacks are

256
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,940
mostly targeted and these are some

257
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,440
persistent attacks some more complex

258
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,500
types of activities and then

259
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,779
one percent of everything that we have

260
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,440
observed so far in 2022 are Insider

261
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,579
threats

262
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,920
and Insider threats mostly relates to

263
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,100
misconfigurations and people clicking

264
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,800
the incorrect button or incorrect Link

265
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,599
in one of their applications

266
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,060
the malware that we've observed during

267
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,660
this year it's extremely diverse and

268
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,399
some of the names here might come up as

269
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,100
might come as a surprise because it's uh

270
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,959
it's a kind of you know the a word for

271
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,360
the most inconsistent lineup of malware

272
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,079
ever we've seen everything from Trojans

273
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,500
and mobile malware to Zeus right

274
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,700
Zeus

275
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,260
that that thing is still alive right so

276
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,279
you know that back in 2021 I think uh

277
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,500
the

278
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,320
Russian authorities that they they said

279
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,500
that they some somehow managed to take

280
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,579
down the people behind the the the the

281
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,980
the the Zeus botnet but well actually

282
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,320
that thing is still alive and kicking

283
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,680
the ransomware mainly distributed out of

284
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,660
Russia

285
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,300
um with it's you know that county is

286
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,760
highly modular but um what we've

287
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,880
observed is that for the better part of

288
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,760
the the detections

289
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,700
Conti was set as a wiper they didn't

290
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,820
even try to actually encrypt and then

291
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,160
ask for money they were just trying to

292
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,680
wipe everything off this is

293
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,040
right again a low level of

294
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,540
sophistication when it comes to these

295
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,279
types of attacks or actually it might be

296
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,120
an inability of the attacker to act upon

297
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,100
that Ransom because at least from

298
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,860
starting with March 2022 it would have

299
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,380
been very difficult for an entity in

300
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,320
Europe to actually pay a ransom to

301
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,139
someone in Russia for example or in

302
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,720
China and not because of the sanctions

303
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,760
but mostly because Bitcoin and every

304
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,959
crypto was way down

305
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,079
the vectors the attacks and the vectors

306
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,300
themselves

307
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,459
of course of course phishing still

308
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,620
Reigns Supreme with six out of 10

309
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,180
attacks

310
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,040
being delivered this way

311
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,000
and it's mostly emails but we did see an

312
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,940
increase in 2022 over 2021 when it comes

313
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,639
to social media people are reacting more

314
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,680
and more to private messages direct

315
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,260
messages over some type of platform and

316
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,660
then they follow through the links but

317
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,980
of course it's fishing it's topical

318
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,100
fishing so it's mostly related it was in

319
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,740
the beginning of 2022 it was related to

320
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,800
covid uh but then of course topics

321
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,620
change to to from I don't know from uh

322
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,880
the war in Ukraine to inflation and gas

323
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,959
prices and uh the broken down economy

324
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,019
whatever you may call it some political

325
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:01,980
maneuvering and political call to

326
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,260
actions there but

327
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,600
this is although this is still worrying

328
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,220
uh it does bring some type of diminished

329
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,800
Comfort when it comes to mssps knowing

330
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,199
that phishing in itself

331
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,660
it's something that can be partially

332
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,760
mitigated and successfully mitigated

333
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,320
although partially by education and

334
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
awareness right so you don't have to

335
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,959
build huge uh firewalls in front of it

336
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,180
you don't have to I don't know invest

337
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,320
your K-PAX into some type of new French

338
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,740
technology you just have to insist in

339
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,980
educating your users right and raising

340
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,899
the awareness

341
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,300
then

342
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,459
maybe less than one percent of each of

343
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,880
the observed attacks was a vector to an

344
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,420
exploit to an active software exploit

345
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,800
right that is

346
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,440
this is surprising for me at least and

347
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,000
again uh acts as an enforcement to what

348
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,220
I've said earlier that for the better

349
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,300
part of the attacks

350
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,220
the attackers are mostly uh searching

351
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,260
for an opportunity to gain access they

352
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,860
are not necessarily targeting uh one one

353
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,660
person or another or one entity or

354
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,579
another

355
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,980
and of course a lot of noise

356
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,740
Brute Force DDOS is all over the place

357
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,180
it has been constantly it has become a

358
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,399
run-of-the-mill

359
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,820
type of you know title in the news in

360
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,220
the news cycle everyone is talking about

361
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,019
or at least they have been talking about

362
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,000
DDOS in um from from late spring to

363
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,079
early summer 2022 as this thing that

364
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,240
might cause you some minor discomfort

365
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,279
but we have to get accustomed to

366
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,480
looking forward to moving forward with

367
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,540
with the vectors in itself Cobalt strike

368
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,540
of course everyone is using it and well

369
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,900
we've seen a large range of beacons you

370
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,780
know like hack beacons in use

371
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,359
all over the place

372
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,000
mostly uh starting with the hot with

373
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,640
with the with the third quarter of 2022

374
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,339
so in the second half of 2022

375
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,679
and they try to push anything and

376
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,200
everything to it to those beacons you

377
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,780
know because once you have write your

378
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,059
your strong foot in the strong fold you

379
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,740
can you can actually push everything to

380
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,220
to a cobal strike Beacon ransomware as a

381
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,559
service we've seen Revel

382
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,600
we've seen Revel actually in use in

383
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,100
Romania

384
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,260
in Romania as in the C2C was located in

385
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,360
Romania

386
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,500
um

387
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,280
DDOS again not the most notable operator

388
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,620
you know it's killnet

389
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,419
some of you might have heard of this

390
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,860
group of

391
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,559
well malicious actors stemming coming

392
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,539
from Russia

393
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,380
um uh it has been a personal curiosity

394
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,960
to observe uh to observe these people

395
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,900
from you know like general public

396
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,580
knowledge and whatever was readily

397
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,559
available and some ascent

398
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,419
in order to get a better better

399
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,000
understanding of not not of their

400
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,840
motivation but what uh what is it about

401
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,360
their sophistication and they uh their

402
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,059
ability to actually inflict the damage

403
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,140
they are extremely noisy with extremely

404
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,720
low gains and low yield

405
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm going to say it and I'm going to say

406
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,020
the very very in a very I hope

407
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,940
concise way killnet is a joke

408
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,380
moving forward to mobile attack mobile

409
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,780
attacks

410
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,880
large scale campaigns through SMS mostly

411
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,160
at the end of 2021 and the beginning of

412
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,960
2022

413
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,140
some 25 percent increase in the number

414
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,760
of campaigns

415
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,039
and the surface of the campaign was

416
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,919
actually worrisome in in February 2022 I

417
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,460
remember that now I was reading this

418
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,760
this report from dnsc if I remember

419
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,160
correctly

420
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,280
stating that some half up to half a

421
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,679
million of

422
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,480
users from Romania might have been

423
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,919
targets of a SMS phishing campaign

424
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,100
all right

425
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,320
and then we'd run somewhere we have a

426
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,400
mixed bag of uh of incidents it's mostly

427
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,500
the high profile victims are hit and

428
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,780
miss you might have heard like in the

429
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,480
news Cycles about some hospitals being

430
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,260
taken off for some days here some 72 or

431
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,240
96 hours while they restore from backup

432
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,419
some other entities

433
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:05,160
uh actually boasting about the fact that

434
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,679
they do keep all their information in

435
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,860
written form so a ransomware attack like

436
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,140
a disruptive attack to their to the

437
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,520
availability of their infrastructure is

438
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,200
not such a big deal

439
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,900
this is the case in what we have been

440
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,679
observing until now ransomware is is is

441
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,320
one of the most

442
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,200
um you know the most detected the

443
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,299
detected attacks types of attacks in

444
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,679
2022 but the impact of ransomware in

445
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,120
Romania is not as

446
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,460
important as in other parts of the

447
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,780
Western World at least by comparison

448
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,460
from public reports and again some

449
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,960
ascent

450
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,000
maybe some two to three percent of each

451
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,460
of the victims of ransomware attack

452
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,940
actually stand to lose

453
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,600
either business critical or other types

454
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,240
of important information during those

455
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,700
attacks I'm not saying that ransomware

456
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,440
is not meant to be worrisome it is and I

457
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,820
presume that

458
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,039
most of the people in this audience know

459
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,900
that ransomware is still one of the

460
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,880
things that we have to deal with and

461
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,320
we'll probably have to deal with for the

462
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,820
better part of the I don't know the

463
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,500
foreseeable future but the

464
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,820
reality as we're seeing it in our

465
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,940
customer infrastructure is that the

466
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,020
impact is not uh sufficiently high in

467
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,580
order to

468
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,000
um you know to have us

469
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,600
um either enforcing some types of very

470
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,400
restrictive policies when it comes to

471
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,320
using the assets or the internet

472
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,179
connectivity or in other means

473
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:57,320
changing the way we provide our services

474
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,580
the attackers

475
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,039
um you can of course gain a very high

476
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,840
level overview of some of the

477
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,640
observables in business internet

478
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,159
security or mssp Provider from our

479
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,080
business internet security report the

480
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,059
fifth edition is readily available and I

481
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,260
think you can download it and you think

482
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,179
you can browse it from the orange stand

483
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,120
I'm going to focus on these four

484
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,880
countries

485
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,580
as you probably know it's extremely it's

486
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,980
extremely difficult to pinpoint a attack

487
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,580
when it hits your firewalls right VPS

488
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:35,340
says are extremely are very inexpensive

489
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,940
Europe has large bandwidths when a large

490
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,400
bandwidth when it comes to connectivity

491
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,620
to Romania uh so does China and U.S what

492
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,480
we what we did here is that we

493
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,919
went over some of the observables

494
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,280
hitting our firewalls and we try to

495
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,700
pinpoint some of the

496
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,120
attackers some of the APT groups

497
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,580
that we know from either open source

498
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,360
intelligence or some of our collected

499
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,620
Insider collected threat intelligence

500
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,559
from Orange Romania we've known to be

501
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,159
operating in either China Russia us or

502
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,919
as you will see uh in the next slide in

503
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,080
uh Iran

504
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,460
and unfortunately we did see and we are

505
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,880
still we are still witnessing some

506
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,100
activity from uh some of the

507
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,000
most let's let me put it this way some

508
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,980
of the most important apt groups that

509
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,159
we've we've been monitoring and

510
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,620
observing

511
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,980
for the past two or three years so

512
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,919
and this year the Russians of course

513
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,140
they are the most visible apt-28 and 29

514
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,120
they deal mostly in phishing attacks and

515
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,179
they uh their goal is to exfiltrate data

516
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,100
fortunately for our customers they

517
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,940
didn't

518
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:10,940
uh get to do that and again killnet

519
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,679
the very high noise group that has spun

520
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,080
off to smaller groups such as no name

521
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,740
zero five seven and this is an apt group

522
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,419
that

523
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,720
um should be should be monitored for the

524
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,520
next I don't know

525
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,820
half a year up to a year or so because

526
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,400
they are they are very very active in

527
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,659
the CIS States and they are reaching

528
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,780
um and they are moving towards towards

529
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,120
Eastern Europe

530
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,000
um apt-27 and 41 these are the Chinese

531
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,880
groups that we've been

532
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,679
monitoring and targeting in our client

533
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,000
infrastructure

534
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,100
again mostly fishing

535
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,140
the occasional ransomware here and then

536
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,360
but their principal goal is to

537
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,100
exfiltrate data

538
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,840
they don't care that much about the type

539
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,159
of data they are searching for

540
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,900
everything that can be consumed is good

541
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,980
to be exfiltrated

542
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,780
apt-27 for example they use spear

543
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,340
phishing so these are more sophisticated

544
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,700
attacks better targeting a given company

545
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,940
or individual and they use something

546
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,799
they use malware such as quick pulse to

547
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,720
deploy their

548
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,120
their advantages

549
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,320
and

550
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,820
apt 35 and this is 2022 has been the

551
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,440
first year that we monitored and we

552
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,440
observed we've observed the the activity

553
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,799
of this Iranian apt group the newscaster

554
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,380
group they deal mostly in very complex

555
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,980
social engineering operations

556
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,140
um their goal their goals are actually

557
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,960
multiple

558
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,140
they will probably you know be satisfied

559
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,600
if they managed to wipe something or

560
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,940
exploitate

561
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,740
any type of data they can access

562
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,900
but this has been very interesting for

563
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,520
us because

564
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,220
um again Romania is not

565
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,679
usually or let's say traditionally a

566
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,559
target of any kind of interest for

567
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,860
Middle Eastern apt groups and I'm

568
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,500
talking about direct targeting rights

569
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,299
spear phishing

570
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,840
or even whaling

571
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,179
they too long didn't read of this slide

572
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,580
and the previous slide is that while

573
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,640
there is minimal apt activity across our

574
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,980
monitoring surface

575
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,400
the attempts of exploitations although

576
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,580
are detected they are they have very

577
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,039
very low yields so they don't

578
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,620
necessarily have a uh you know the

579
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,860
expected outcome or impact of the apt's

580
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,640
group

581
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,320
and the most the the the

582
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,360
most observables are phishing artifacts

583
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,139
and fishing attacks

584
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,799
the targets

585
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,260
um of course I'm not I'm not going to

586
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,240
give a specific and I'm not going to you

587
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,539
know mention like companies and

588
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,779
Enterprises that have been targets of uh

589
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:19,620
of our the attacks that I mentioned

590
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,580
before

591
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,200
it's interesting to see that Healthcare

592
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,659
and Pharma have been the premium Target

593
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,480
of 2022 and this is again from our

594
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,580
service provider infrastructure with

595
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,080
government government and public

596
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,600
services in second place and this is

597
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,640
mostly because because of the large

598
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,100
volumes of the DDOS attacks in April and

599
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,299
May of 2022 against some government and

600
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,799
public services websites mostly

601
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,659
um retail and transportations

602
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:49,860
Transportation are lost

603
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,240
and Bucharest has been the prime region

604
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,320
uh for observing attacks

605
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,440
and again this can be explained by the

606
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,720
fact that most of the government and

607
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,279
public services that have been targeted

608
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,380
by attacks in 2022 are physically

609
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,840
located in Bucharest and what we do is

610
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,000
that we can actually monitor for a wide

611
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,340
range of attacks using the business

612
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,320
internet security infrastructure and

613
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,840
then we can correlate the data with the

614
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,059
geographical location of those entities

615
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,880
of those and of those companies and

616
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,159
provide you with this very nice looking

617
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,820
graphs

618
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,600
and again predictions and this is my I

619
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,059
think yeah this is my final slide coming

620
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,620
back to what I've said

621
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,240
um in the beginning predictions are

622
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,580
extremely hard to follow

623
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,059
um it is mostly hit and miss because the

624
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,600
context in itself might change and the

625
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,580
context actually has been changing very

626
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,500
very quickly in the past

627
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,860
12 years or 12 months or so

628
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,520
but given the the the things that we

629
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,820
we've been seeing in 2022 and in 2021

630
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,220
and giving the very

631
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,140
um

632
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,020
the very heavy context of geopolitical

633
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,700
conflict of

634
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,640
um post covid

635
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,279
um changes when it comes to the way we

636
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:23,700
work the way we travel or the way we

637
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,460
interact with each other

638
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,720
um I can safely assume that 2023 is

639
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,360
going to be extremely rough

640
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,500
um

641
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,600
there is probably going to be an

642
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,720
increase in ICS targeting so this is an

643
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,179
industrial control

644
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,279
systems and iot infrastructures

645
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,980
mostly because the attacks are probably

646
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,419
going to manifest themselves through

647
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,520
that red line between the I.T and the

648
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,980
operational the OT side of of those

649
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,980
factories and when it comes to iot it's

650
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,740
ubiquitous everyone uses it it uses it

651
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,200
everyone has some smart something in

652
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,399
their homes

653
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,880
uh most of us at least interact with

654
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,159
those devices on a daily basis

655
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,679
this is a very very ripe and a very

656
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,799
interesting attack surface for any type

657
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,639
of malicious sector

658
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,620
when it comes to adversarial stuff AI

659
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,620
um everyone has

660
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,679
has been mentioning AI as this

661
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,779
game-changing reality altering type of

662
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:33,000
technology that is going to bring either

663
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,100
I don't know the destruction of the

664
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,080
civilization as we know it or the

665
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,419
beginning of some new and bright era in

666
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,700
human development it's been neither of

667
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,360
those but um it's not a buzzword anymore

668
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,600
it is becoming a reality and it is being

669
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,000
actively actively used for noise

670
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,799
generation and obfuscation of other

671
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,899
types of attacks right so you have ai

672
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,940
that generates a lot of noise a lot of

673
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,580
traffic a lot of interesting seemingly

674
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,520
interesting events in order to uh

675
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,820
somehow obfuscate the real malicious

676
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,460
activity that is happening in the

677
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,539
background

678
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,600
and it is being used in order to derive

679
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,880
new evasive techniques

680
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,179
and to diversify the ttps of the

681
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:19,679
attackers

682
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,720
and last

683
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,500
and definitely not least cyber warfare

684
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,240
the cat is out of a bag

685
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,320
2022 has been the first year in at least

686
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,260
my recollection

687
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,940
when State actors have been publicly and

688
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,740
actively attacking institutions in

689
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,539
French unfriendly countries

690
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,840
without any

691
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,200
type of political response

692
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,240
so seemingly

693
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,020
without any type of

694
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,039
um

695
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,740
you know

696
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,840
coercion on or on the part of the

697
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,159
victims

698
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,559
this is extremely and extremely

699
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,399
dangerous this is this is a a a a a

700
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,860
playing Ground full of landmines because

701
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,539
as soon as one state actor actively runs

702
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,380
apt groups or um I don't know some type

703
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,140
of government agency in order to attack

704
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,000
infrastructure public infrastructure of

705
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,200
other countries and the you know the

706
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,020
global political response is wear and

707
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,880
see

708
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,480
this will most definitely open a very

709
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,620
very large door to everyone investing in

710
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,720
cyber warfare

711
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,020
it's easier and it's less expensive than

712
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,620
bombs and tanks it's readily available

713
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,299
and the effects can be of grave

714
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:02,899
importance

715
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,399
there is a huge bill of material at the

716
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,620
disposal of these actors

717
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,260
once you are stay once you you're

718
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,720
becoming state sponsored there is not

719
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,460
there's not much that you ask for and

720
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,860
you and you cannot get

721
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,220
anything from bandwidth to access to

722
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,419
exploits zero days to whatever days

723
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,600
this is these are some of the reasons

724
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,419
that I think that unfortunately

725
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:37,019
for 2023 and maybe for for the next few

726
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,140
years cyber warfare is going to be one

727
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,080
of the

728
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,720
most present dangers when it comes to

729
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,240
cyber security

730
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,399
I really hope I didn't scare you and I

731
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,799
really hope that I didn't bore you

732
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,899
there's no time for Q a but I I am

733
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,539
available for for your questions in um

734
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,179
you know around at the orange stand or

735
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:04,660
in the hallway thank you have a good one

736
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:10,449
[Applause]
