1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
the pack is not a pack of cigarettes

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,140
it's a pack of wolves that was the

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,660
initial idea of the presentation but uh

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,019
you were asking Godzilla so you know

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,519
um hello everyone

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,980
um I'm Sebastian petite I'm I actually

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,500
work for bit Sentinel so for the people

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,100
so you know the organizing uh body

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,980
that's doing uh Dev camp and hopefully

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,859
today I'll try to speak something

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,320
interesting if not smart about what we

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,820
did for

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,300
um let's say the educational part of of

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,440
cyber security so without further Ado

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,260
who am I uh as Godzilla said I've wore

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,360
many hats I'm a programmer by my formal

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,239
by my formal education but I didn't

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,760
never did like the program a lot so I

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,559
did networking I did infrastructure I

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,860
did security and I've tried having fun

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,280
while doing it and you know

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,699
staying aside from the boring stuff that

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,100
no one that no one likes to do

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,860
right let's start with you know a show

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,420
of hands as with any good presentation

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,799
does who thinks knows when the first CTF

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
was ever brought up to the world

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
okay let me let's let's put it

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,000
differently who think it was between

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,540
2010 and 2020.

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,659
no one okay between uh 2000 and 2010

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,200
okay uh who thinks it was between the

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,320
90s and the 2000s

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,600
okay yeah but you know the presentation

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,299
you don't come come on so actually the

36
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,299
first CTF was in 1993 according to that

37
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,340
that interesting security tool we called

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,240
Google and it was a Defcon now if 1993

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,579
doesn't tell you a lot of things let me

40
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,979
put things into technical perspective

41
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,860
that was one of my first computers it

42
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,040
was a Commodore 64 I got I believe two

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,979
or three years before 1993 I'm pretty

44
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,479
old

45
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,098
um and this guy had 64 kilobytes of ram

46
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,860
you know just to give you you know some

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,959
perspective how way back didn't this was

48
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,940
a good friend of mine said man I believe

49
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,459
that now my radio has more than the the

50
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,959
radio that I keep in my in my kitchen

51
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,940
has more than 64 kilobytes of RAM

52
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,840
now

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,099
um

54
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,200
we've started doing the attacking

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,020
defense as a natural progression from

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,480
CTF from from capture the flag and again

57
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,980
I don't want to offend anyone because

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,080
I've you know kind of shown the

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,879
presentation around and some people got

60
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,739
a bit offended about what I'm gonna say

61
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,480
in here but it's not gonna offend anyone

62
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,519
it's you know just my view on how things

63
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,840
are so

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,220
ctfs

65
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,560
and you know you've probably guessed you

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,700
know the the first part of the

67
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,099
presentation while doing CTF while doing

68
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,260
capturing the flag it's you against you

69
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,120
or you against someone it's basically

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
the lonely wolf it's you it doesn't

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,200
matter if it's a garage if it's a room

72
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
if it's your living room it's just you

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,400
against the computer doing things right

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,680
trying to hack trying to get you know

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,840
hack the machine trying to get that flag

76
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,420
trying to you know do whatever it is

77
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,239
that the scenario is is is is is telling

78
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,300
you to do it right it's good as a

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,819
beginner because you need to start from

80
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:22,440
somewhere and start doing and cyber

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,620
security is not about doing but uh

82
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,780
it's not necessarily the real the the

83
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,540
the uh the real deal so to speak it's

84
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,300
not that close to real life which we're

85
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,280
all you know hopefully preparing for you

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
know doing you know defending from from

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
the bad guys and you know all that good

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,500
stuff

89
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,659
so again it's not

90
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,180
it's not that close to real life

91
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,099
um it's fun

92
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,680
it lasts as long as you want but that's

93
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,540
not necessarily a good thing because on

94
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,540
a real life you know incident the bad

95
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,819
guy is gonna get you now you can't say

96
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,560
to the bad guy hey you know what I have

97
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,299
my my coffee to drink and I'm not

98
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,459
feeling that inspired to do that SQL

99
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,200
injection today so maybe you can wait

100
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,480
for a couple of more hours until no that

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,980
thing doesn't happen in real life as we

102
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,920
all know right also

103
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,760
security is more than the red team I

104
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,279
mean red team is a huge animal in itself

105
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,959
but security is more than that you also

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,940
have the blue team and I kind of feel

107
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,940
that you know CTF is getting you to uh

108
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,560
to a place where you have a very very

109
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,320
red mindset you know I just want to get

110
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,300
in there I want to hack things I want to

111
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,160
destroy things and that's it and there's

112
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,320
a lot more to cyber security than than

113
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,540
red

114
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,040
um and again as a contest organizer it's

115
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,419
somewhat easier to organize right you

116
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:43,560
don't have anything

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,580
um

118
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,460
that's interactive you just spin a

119
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,320
virtual machine or Docker container and

120
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
you have things in there and you know

121
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,180
people play it's it still takes time

122
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,979
because you need to imagine all these

123
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,300
challenges but

124
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,919
again it's a little bit easier to

125
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,600
organize

126
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,680
now

127
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,100
attack and defense and you start being

128
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,139
part of the pack and I want to pause

129
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,780
here a little bit because

130
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,479
we all like computers and I will say

131
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
something which you know people have

132
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,440
hated me for in the past I don't like

133
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,580
people

134
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,699
people are not I mean machines are this

135
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:21,720
this

136
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,460
um

137
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,500
I forgot the word

138
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,060
um

139
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,639
they are deterministic things people are

140
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,039
not deterministic you can

141
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,840
interact with someone else they will

142
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,580
have different answers according to

143
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,960
their mood which you which you can't

144
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
control and it's really something that

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,820
you you know you like that much but For

146
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,460
Better or For Worse were people and

147
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,340
we're supposed to work in teams and I

148
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,979
believe this is the first not okay soft

149
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,139
or non-technical advantage that running

150
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,479
an attack and defense program

151
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,740
um you know

152
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,199
forces you to do actually as a small

153
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,300
joke the first time when when we ran

154
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,880
this program was in August of of this

155
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
year and we had people which were very

156
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,840
very good at doing you know pen testing

157
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,539
and and red things but their first

158
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,639
feedback after the exercise was over was

159
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,100
like man I had to talk with the other

160
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,259
guy I actually had to communicate with

161
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,380
him and see how things work and again

162
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,639
that's

163
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,919
extremely important if you're the

164
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,979
smartest guy in the room doing cyber red

165
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,020
blue doesn't matter but you work on your

166
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,759
own and you can't talk with your

167
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,940
colleagues

168
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,580
you're a superstar but on your own thing

169
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,160
so you know

170
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,440
that that gets uh that gets complicated

171
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,419
another thing nice thing that you can do

172
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,100
for attack and defense is that it

173
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,560
broadens your skill it's not hey I need

174
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,360
to run this exploit and bang be done

175
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,759
with it no now you also need to defend

176
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,740
yourself so you need to think about okay

177
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,680
how can I stop the other guy how can I

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,919
you know write some um some small python

179
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,900
script or build something in Gold that

180
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,720
you know can be turned into a web or you

181
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,940
know an IPS or something really quick

182
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,220
and dirty but to defend myself it's a

183
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,600
different mindset it's it's more

184
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,600
difficult but I believe it it's

185
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,039
um complete you as a cyber security

186
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,080
professional in a way that it also gives

187
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
you more perspective on The Blue Team on

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,740
the defending part

189
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,819
right

190
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,639
um it's a bit closer to real life

191
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,860
scenario although it's still not there

192
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,060
but we're going to touch on this a

193
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,539
little bit later and um it's it's still

194
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,479
fun it's more fun if you ask me

195
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,199
um

196
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,180
another thing that attacking defense

197
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,840
comes closer to real life is time is of

198
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,599
the essence you can't you don't have the

199
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,220
privilege of going out for a coffee

200
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,139
because the guys which are at the next

201
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,780
you know table from you or across the

202
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,120
globe playing with you to attack you

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,560
they're gonna be in there okay I wanna

204
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,300
pound his ass I want to pound the

205
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,099
infrastructure you know so that is

206
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,020
important as well so it brings you a

207
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,160
little bit closer to real life

208
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,500
production right

209
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,440
um one of the big downsides and this is

210
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,180
probably one of the biggest reasons that

211
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,240
you don't see that many attack and

212
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,259
defense uh you know exercises around or

213
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,120
significantly less than CTF for instance

214
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,759
is it's they are extremely time

215
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,520
consuming to build you know it's it's

216
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,500
complicated because it's not You Against

217
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,660
the Machine it's people against people

218
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,460
and as we already spoke five minutes ago

219
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,379
people are non-deterministic then they

220
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,060
to break things they tend not to follow

221
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,760
the rules even if you say this autoscope

222
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,899
yeah I don't care I'm just going to

223
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,599
attack this because I can while ruining

224
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,880
everyone's fun but that's another thing

225
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,260
so

226
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,620
again this is also a a perspective

227
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,540
so now that we have

228
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,760
you know the the the two the two sides

229
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,120
of the coin CTF and attack and defense

230
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,399
um we also started to you know started

231
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,140
thinking

232
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,760
not a couple of years ago a couple of

233
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,980
months ago hey let's try to do attacking

234
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,560
defense and I left that thing insert

235
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,779
name here because we don't have a name

236
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,399
for the product whether it's just attack

237
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,440
and defense is it's a cyborg to attack

238
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
and defense and if someone can come up

239
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,459
with a catchy name for it then I would

240
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,700
really appreciate it but um this also

241
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,260
comes down to

242
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,120
um you know

243
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,180
a shift from what we think in the in the

244
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,160
same cyber security education right and

245
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,560
they say the times that they're changing

246
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,640
because

247
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,100
it's nice to start with CTF but we want

248
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,380
to train real professionals right like

249
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,839
people that uh

250
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,200
have this close this it's like as close

251
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,700
as possible hands-on experience with

252
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,040
production and we we think that with

253
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,959
attacking defense and especially with

254
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,820
the next level of attack and defense

255
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,140
which I'm going to talk at the end of my

256
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,180
presentation is

257
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,519
we want to train again professionals

258
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,560
with the the closest thing as possible

259
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,899
to to production and this first game of

260
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,940
attack and defense I believe it's a good

261
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,040
start but we're gonna you know

262
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,120
um

263
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,160
improve

264
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,320
what we had in mind we said we want

265
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,860
something simple you know a simple

266
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,540
attack and defense system which is

267
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,519
probably and hopefully one click away

268
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,640
and we kind of think we we've managed

269
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,140
that I mean

270
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,980
you know from the

271
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,540
small details that we have for instance

272
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,000
we use a VPN solutions wireguard by the

273
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
way I presume a lot of a lot of you guys

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,019
have heard about this which it should be

275
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,580
you know as

276
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,260
you know one click away you just click

277
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,240
connect and that's it and it should be

278
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,100
as fast as possible then the game server

279
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,480
I don't have an image here because it

280
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,279
didn't fit quite well but again that's

281
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,600
also you know as as easy as as possible

282
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,100
the other thing that we wanted to do was

283
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,640
a a plugable challenge system which uh

284
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,959
we've kind of built everything the

285
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,880
attack and defense way

286
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,820
um we've also done Docker but we feel

287
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,459
that Docker is not the best thing yet so

288
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,680
we actually went with full-blown virtual

289
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,720
machines that people can exploit and

290
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,060
people can try to patch and you know

291
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,459
protect but do it

292
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:06,000
um

293
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,560
closer to real life again

294
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,040
we also wanted to have a

295
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,320
kind of let's say as low as possible

296
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,300
development time and as quickly as

297
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,760
possible development like deployment so

298
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,800
if possible you just hit one click and

299
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,420
your challenge is in there and we've

300
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,320
kind of succeeded in doing that as well

301
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,180
and for the participants we wanted to

302
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,040
have a minimum you know small

303
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,959
requirements it's like

304
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,440
deep smallest thing that you need is a

305
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,779
computer browser and that's it and you

306
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,820
will understand why it's that and it

307
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,800
also needs to be highly scalable because

308
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,500
if you have I don't know 13 teams and

309
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,740
you have four or five

310
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,579
challenges or four or five virtual

311
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,740
machines if you do the simple math you

312
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,540
know 13 times four you actually get a

313
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,079
lot of original 13 is 52 so it's 52

314
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,940
virtual machines which you will see okay

315
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,980
52 is not that much but when you start

316
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,980
adding RAM and storage and CPU that kind

317
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,740
of you know gets a bit big

318
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,579
so that's what we kind you know

319
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:13,700
drafted as being the the initial

320
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,380
requirements and we

321
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,160
technology work please okay right and

322
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
then we said okay these are the

323
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
requirements how should we do it so

324
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,700
first of all we needed a um some sort of

325
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,100
automation platform right so an

326
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,540
automation platform that would be able

327
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,940
to interact with deep infrastructure we

328
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,019
didn't know at the time what the

329
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,700
infrastructure would be but we said okay

330
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,579
how can we you know

331
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,100
with something pretty much that can

332
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,720
interact with the infrastructure both in

333
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
creating virtual machines shutting down

334
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,519
virtual machines and being able to go in

335
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,959
there and you know make the the

336
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,720
customization that are needed for uh you

337
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,519
know specific things on the of the

338
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,800
exercise and probably to everyone's not

339
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,680
surprised we use we chose ansible

340
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,980
because uh you don't need a uh first of

341
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,540
all you don't need a server for that you

342
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,700
don't need agents you just need you know

343
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,260
some sort of SSH you know some

344
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,820
credentials basically which is an SSH

345
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,279
user password or private key and you're

346
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,380
just in there write something boom and

347
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,720
that's it it's quite uh it's quite easy

348
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,120
we did say in there it would be nice to

349
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,040
have an API because the way we're doing

350
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,740
it right now is basically a gold binary

351
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,600
that goes in and executes an ansible

352
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,000
script as you would do it by hand it's

353
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,519
not that effective it works but it's not

354
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,560
that elegant so maybe we'll try and you

355
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,120
know think to improve this in the past

356
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,620
infrastructure what do you want what

357
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,200
will have as infrastructure so uh we

358
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,639
first said yeah we want to attack and

359
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,620
defense we want to do virtual machines

360
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,720
simple stuff but then we had this idea

361
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,880
hey what if we want to simulate more

362
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,880
what if we if you want to simulate a you

363
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,820
know uh Federal Appliance so what we or

364
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,680
what what if we want to simulate

365
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,560
anything else that there is not a VM and

366
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,420
we said okay and it also needs to be

367
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,700
readily available both in public and

368
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,560
private clouds it also needs to be

369
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,180
available in Enterprises as well so deep

370
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,339
uh you know best solution that that we

371
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,380
found was VMware because For Better Or

372
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,260
forwards you can find VMware pretty much

373
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,639
everywhere

374
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,500
right

375
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,560
um a couple of details about the actual

376
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,860
components of of the game uh the you

377
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,519
know the challenges the the uh

378
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,560
game boxes so to speak but they're

379
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,000
basically the virtual machines where you

380
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,740
have all people you have one or multiple

381
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,040
exercises the uh thing that we wanted to

382
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,500
do is pretty much

383
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,260
um empower the challenge developers to

384
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,240
build them on their own on the you know

385
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,100
some sort of VMware instance inside

386
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,920
their their laptops or inside their

387
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,260
environment whatever that may be and

388
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,880
then deploy those as as virtual

389
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,959
templates and put them you know in a

390
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,600
VMware vcenter cluster and you know run

391
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,519
them from there so again decouple

392
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,560
development from deployment as and as

393
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,360
long as you've built that virtual

394
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,220
machine and you've created that template

395
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,860
using specific rules then that would be

396
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,139
readily Deployable inside the the

397
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,120
challenge system as well and of course

398
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,760
we use Linux for the time being we're

399
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,220
also thinking about Windows but

400
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,320
things are a bit more diff more

401
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,880
difficult in there

402
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,560
um we also have the concept of play

403
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,560
boxes so it's something that we've ex

404
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,880
we've experimented in the first

405
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,860
iteration of our Tech and defense system

406
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,440
the second one which was yesterday

407
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,899
um no we didn't do basically the play

408
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,360
boxes are Linux virtual machines that

409
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,459
that have you probably guessed it Kali

410
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,500
installed where you can access them via

411
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,660
xrdp or uh VNC or web page the web

412
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,240
version of VNC so if you basically don't

413
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,579
have a local machine or if you want to

414
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,160
uh you know you don't want to play with

415
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,860
your local machine for whatever reason

416
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,240
you can use this this type of thing you

417
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,060
just Connect into it and that's uh you

418
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,220
know that's that's pretty much it you

419
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,260
know to the more technical-ish side of

420
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,899
things I'm being told there is a pointer

421
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,440
huh

422
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,959
it almost works okay right so this is

423
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,360
the way how you know the it looks is a

424
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,839
pretty flat uh thing so you guys are

425
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,019
basically over here

426
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,660
okay so I'm just gonna show so imagine I

427
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,699
mean you guys this is you over here

428
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,800
you're basically playing over the the

429
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,480
internet whenever you log into the

430
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,120
challenge you you go to a web page you

431
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,920
download your workout configuration you

432
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,839
download the file boom that's it you

433
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,699
click connect once you click connect

434
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,980
you'll have access to at least two

435
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,920
subnets and two big supernets so to

436
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,779
speak one is the game box subnet which

437
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,339
you will have all the virtual machines

438
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,519
both yours and your opponents and if

439
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,139
that specific attack and defense

440
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,480
exercise is built that way you'll also

441
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,519
have the playback subnet those virtual

442
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,079
machines where you have call installed

443
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,240
and so on and so forth so you also see

444
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,619
the game management system and the game

445
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,199
system this is let's say everyone a

446
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,299
modified version because if you're

447
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:16,140
running uh this inside VMware and you're

448
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,000
in for some reason you don't want to

449
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,980
expose the public IP address of this

450
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,799
we've just created a scoring system

451
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,619
which is basically the the front end

452
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,819
that you can deploy in any cloud

453
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,700
provider and then this Auto magically

454
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,040
connects using a wire guard tunnel with

455
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,500
deep let's say cyber range border

456
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,200
firewall and then you know that connects

457
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,240
to that guy over there

458
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,280
but I'm going to presume you also have a

459
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,380
viral at your at your perimeter this is

460
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,580
the game system which we're going to

461
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,860
talk about it a bit later on how it

462
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,500
actually it actually works

463
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,580
um as general rule how we do things at

464
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,059
StarTex you have uh it depends from 10

465
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,580
minutes to one hour to log in your own

466
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,860
virtual machines try to find out what's

467
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,660
in there try to do some patching try to

468
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,700
defend yourself from the bad guys so to

469
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,260
speak and then when we when we hit gamex

470
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,440
um then you know the there are some

471
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,000
federal rules are getting updated on

472
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,640
that firewall and then it's free for all

473
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,580
everyone everyone against everyone

474
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,880
I believe I didn't miss anything in here

475
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,340
and this is let's say the the juicier

476
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,260
part and you probably recognize the

477
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,840
emblem over there it's go

478
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,179
um one thing that I would you know that

479
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,700
the the this whole game engine was

480
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,539
written you know the core of it uh by

481
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,780
um Andrei our CEO in probably I believe

482
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,260
a weekend or a weekend or so he was like

483
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,480
okay I just want to let him go I wanna

484
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,900
you know

485
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,059
get formulas with the language so he

486
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,039
wrote this and I'm saying this because

487
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,260
I'm actually you know really proud that

488
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,000
I can be in an organization that says

489
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,980
hey you can actually

490
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,500
have people higher up that actually

491
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,360
doing their they're that Technical and

492
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,580
they know these things and plus I mean

493
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,880
it seemed fun to to mention this so uh

494
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,000
we we built this whole system all of the

495
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,380
great

496
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,780
um let's say Parts in here you can

497
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,240
imagine them as being either uh

498
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,400
individual individual virtual machines

499
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,039
or uh containers we're actually running

500
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,860
the both editions we ran in docking

501
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,140
containers so basically this whole thing

502
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,900
over here was a big virtual machine with

503
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,240
lots and lots of of of virtual

504
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,940
containers in there and the way attack

505
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,120
and defense goes for you know

506
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,039
those of you who are not that familiar

507
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,320
with the nitty and gritty details you

508
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,020
have rounds rounds are about two minutes

509
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,140
and in this in these rounds you as an

510
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,360
attacker uh you're supposed to hold your

511
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,520
flag which is basically a string written

512
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,760
somewhere in your system right

513
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,919
um and you need to make sure that that

514
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,919
is still that is still there and

515
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,620
that's one thing and as a Defender story

516
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,500
and as an attacker you're supposed to

517
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,780
gain access to the system get that

518
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,539
string somehow or get that that flag

519
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,200
somehow from the target system and feed

520
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,059
it back to the scoring system using a

521
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,220
very simple web web API which is

522
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,059
basically that you know the uh the game

523
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,480
engine that gets fed the ID web UI uh

524
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,700
grpc

525
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,160
so the way this goes every two minutes

526
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,200
there's the the game engine will will

527
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,280
publish a task on the uh you know topic

528
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,440
so to speak of of publisher subscribers

529
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,179
you'll have these workers which again

530
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,520
their their Docker containers

531
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,160
um and these will do one of the three

532
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,240
um

533
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,640
actions you can either check the SLA so

534
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,100
basically this means going on the target

535
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,720
machine and checking that the target

536
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,820
service is still up these are things

537
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,280
written in Python and we have a

538
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,240
framework where we check these check the

539
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,860
flag which basically consists into

540
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,360
logging in the virtual machine and

541
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,160
seeing if the flag is still there or not

542
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,799
and then placing the flag because that's

543
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:17,280
the way we can we can show we can

544
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,220
check if you have if you an attacker you

545
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,840
have a persist you have persistence or

546
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,880
not or the defender you are able to keep

547
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,100
to keep things in there and of course

548
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,539
just go back and forth back and forth

549
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:28,980
back and forth

550
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,320
um and again as an as an attacker we

551
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,600
also try to test your programming let's

552
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,419
say uh type of things because you're

553
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,460
supposed to automate

554
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,559
whenever you have again a foothold on

555
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,080
the system get that flag extract it and

556
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,039
send it back to the game engine for uh

557
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,539
you know for web UI

558
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,539
um yesterday as you probably know we had

559
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,860
an attacking defense and defense uh you

560
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,559
know competition that was held you know

561
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,480
in the other room I believe yeah it's

562
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,980
actually it's actually over there we

563
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,020
have 12 teams we had the you know pretty

564
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,440
much 30 VMS we had 240 rounds which

565
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,620
equates I think to eight hours

566
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,140
um a huge gap between the lowest score

567
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,799
and the and and the and the the the the

568
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,360
highest score what's interesting is

569
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,400
people move really fast and we've seen

570
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,100
roughly 80 flags being stolen per minute

571
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,080
which is a lot considering that we

572
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
didn't have so many virtual machines

573
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,659
fun thing that I wanted to mention is

574
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:37,200
the average uptime was 58 so guys really

575
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,120
don't get a job in devops or system

576
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,520
engineering because with that that is a

577
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,020
career limiting move if you have an

578
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,980
update of 58 you will get fired okay so

579
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,380
you know these these were the the uh

580
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,659
some some stats these were the the the

581
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,159
the

582
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:53,940
um

583
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,700
scores of each team

584
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,100
um and you you can probably see you know

585
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,940
people uh because the first two teams I

586
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,320
believe that they're seasoned

587
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
Professionals in in attack and defense

588
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,600
and morale I'm not too sure about the

589
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,200
the uh you know remaining others but

590
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,280
again some stats for for everyone

591
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,760
and uh yeah these were the the

592
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,880
challenges that we we put in there again

593
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm not really a red guy so probably a

594
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,220
lot of you will know more what this what

595
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,740
this uh entails those were the things

596
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,020
that we had on the on the challenges as

597
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,100
well

598
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,280
and one important thing

599
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,820
um because again this is a an

600
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,080
educational product and that's something

601
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,720
that we want to ultimately deliver to

602
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,419
the uh you know actual to professionals

603
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,820
to Enterprises and we said we want to do

604
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,980
attacking defense with a bit more of a

605
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,679
complex topologies right because from

606
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,240
you've seen from that Graphics pretty

607
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,799
much everything is flat it's a couple of

608
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,900
virtual machines in the same VLAN in

609
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,700
that seat and would like to do something

610
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,820
more exciting like having a DMZ having

611
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,280
an external perimeter having an internal

612
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,140
perimeter all with the role of

613
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,840
simulating as close as possible to a

614
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,600
real life Network right

615
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,480
um these the second thing is uh the way

616
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,280
we're doing challenges right now is you

617
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,020
have a virtual machine and the the

618
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,700
author of The Challenge goes in there

619
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,919
and creates everything by hand which

620
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,620
takes a little bit takes a little bit

621
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,220
more time and you can't mix and match

622
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,080
some things and we're thinking we don't

623
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,059
know yet how to do it but we kind of

624
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,120
want to have a system where randomly you

625
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,340
can put in some some things in there

626
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,200
that the template gets automatically

627
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,080
generated then you can have let's say on

628
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,020
the spot attack and defense and on the

629
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,919
spot

630
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,380
a bit of random random machines for

631
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,659
those of you who are Gamers and for

632
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,880
those of you who play Diablo back in the

633
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,940
days the first Diablo the uh nice thing

634
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,039
that Diablo had was that randomly

635
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,440
generated maze where you still had some

636
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,419
some checks you still had the bosses I

637
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,159
believe the first one was the butcher if

638
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,740
memory serves me well but um so you

639
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,539
still had these these key elements but

640
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,000
then everything was random uh let's say

641
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,380
down below so that was interesting as

642
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,179
well two more minutes to one minute

643
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,940
we're good okay

644
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,460
um so that's what we're maybe exploring

645
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,320
this with ansible we're not sure what

646
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,720
we'll see uh the third thing that we'd

647
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,520
like to do is a bit of a quicker

648
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,919
development now we've seen that four

649
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,380
reasons that we can't really control is

650
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,900
the deployment of virtual machines and

651
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,419
or their modification is a bit more

652
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,580
complicated so we're also exploring some

653
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,620
options in there salt stack looks like a

654
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,960
nice candidate but then again you need

655
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,299
an agent with with a server again we're

656
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,880
exploring things the fourth most

657
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,039
important thing is Windows we want to

658
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,900
have Windows because again we're trying

659
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,480
to simulate production networks and

660
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,700
hopefully we'd like to have active

661
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,460
directory would like to have the dreaded

662
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,900
IIs and you know

663
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,179
closer to real life and also the the the

664
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:10,500
following point with Enterprise

665
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,960
simulation also

666
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,940
um

667
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,480
leads to this ultimately what what we

668
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,159
try to have is try to simulate an

669
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,679
Enterprise Network the exact same way as

670
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:23,820
you would find it with an active

671
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,640
directory with the VPN concentrator with

672
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,500
all the also bezel and bells and

673
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,960
whistles for people to play and and you

674
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,419
know to to learn

675
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,880
um what we're also looking at is adding

676
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,000
more device types because you don't have

677
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,799
only virtual machines with Linux and

678
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,659
windows on an Enterprise Network and in

679
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,340
real life you also have some firewalls

680
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,840
we have some appliances you have you

681
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,460
have all of these things so we're also

682
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,039
exploring the the you know how how we

683
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,159
could we could do that and last but not

684
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,020
this is for us the organizer we'd like

685
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,480
to have true self service because

686
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,020
yesterday we had uh you know things went

687
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,299
smoothly for the majority of the time

688
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,520
but we still needed to be there and be

689
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,340
able to check if things were working uh

690
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,559
correct or not so like to have a true

691
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,659
self service where people from our team

692
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,580
can just go in there say yeah okay so

693
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,380
you have to this challenge boom that's

694
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,760
deployed you need to reset this

695
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,740
challenge boom that's deployed as well

696
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,080
but again this is more of an internal

697
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,480
type type of things and with with this

698
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,400
true self service we've also collected

699
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,080
yesterday's feedback about the game

700
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,960
server being a bit slow-ish and we've

701
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,779
kind of made some some quick fixes in

702
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,480
production thank you for that

703
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,039
so uh this was it that was me I hope it

704
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,120
was

705
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,400
if it wasn't at least smart it was

706
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,220
interesting and

707
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,900
um I would like to hear your feedback

708
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,240
and your questions if any

709
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,520
thank you Sebastian

710
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,279
any questions from the room thank you we

711
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:59,900
have there one question ah

712
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,760
hi Sebastian thank you for the

713
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,140
presentation would you say that the dctf

714
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,240
competition would gravitate towards more

715
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,980
of these attack and defense challenges

716
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,020
moving forward

717
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,360
uh most likely yes because we're also

718
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,659
seeing other other players so

719
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,159
how many of you have heard about the

720
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,740
European cyber security challenge ecsc

721
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,659
okay so the

722
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,179
so this is a you know quick English

723
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,400
listen a cyber security event that's

724
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,220
hosted by Anisa and which Juniors and

725
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,460
seniors but in seniors think until 21 or

726
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,919
22 years years of age gather from each

727
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,320
country and they do you know they they

728
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,200
play so this year as a novelty they said

729
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,539
hey we're we're going to scrape this the

730
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,340
CTF thing and we're going to attack and

731
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,340
defense and yeah I believe it will more

732
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,140
more and more tax should gravitate

733
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,840
towards this because it gives you a

734
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,299
broader skill set I think so yeah thank

735
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,520
you thank you

736
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,760
Hi how are you and the second and the

737
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,419
last

738
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,000
thank you uh I actually have to please

739
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,279
very fast questions uh the first one is

740
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,039
do you plan to implement and Mac OS

741
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,559
systems we haven't thought about this

742
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,539
but why not I mean

743
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:23,039
okay and as an organization uh we would

744
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,200
will the Enterprise organization be able

745
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,840
to create their own challenges in your

746
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,860
platform uh that if I want to make it as

747
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,460
close as possible as our real

748
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,200
infrastructure let's say

749
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,840
that's the ultimate goal there are some

750
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,520
challenges in in there as well because

751
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,620
if you don't hear infrastructure as code

752
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,500
then you have some admin that okay

753
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,419
promote to active directory next next

754
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,279
finish that's going to be difficult but

755
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,779
yeah ultimately that's what we'd like to

756
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,460
do we'd have to to have you know some

757
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,039
smaller packages with pre-built type of

758
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:58,320
organization but if you want to go full

759
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,820
custom then

760
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,240
you know sky's the limit thank you

761
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,860
thank you as well and thank you

762
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,240
Sebastian

763
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,220
thanks a lot see you
