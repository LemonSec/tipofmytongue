00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,400
be here so let's get started

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,039
secrets of social media psyops a look

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,539
into how social media has been

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,460
weaponized for psychological warfare

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,240
with yours truly bsylab

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,939
before I start here's a little bit about

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,300
me I am 15 years old I was the youngest

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,640
speaker at hope I'm a five-time speaker

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,540
at Defcon and I've also spoken here like

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,579
three years ago or whenever the last

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,739
time it was in person I'm the founder

16
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,379
and CEO of girls who hack our motto is

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,180
teaching girls the skills of hacking so

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,280
that they can change the future

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,559
I have also started building my own

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,379
end-to-end election system called secure

21
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,020
open vote am I election hacking from

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,180
Defcon was highlighted at a

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,500
congressional hearing on Election

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,860
security so a little bit more on secure

25
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,979
open vote I actually brought my voting

26
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,040

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,960
so check it out

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,380
now back to the actual talk

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,020
let's start off with a definition and

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,119
then a little history on how it all got

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,400
started psyops is short for

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,040
psychological warfare operations which

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,619
are military operations usually aimed at

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,479
influencing the enemy State of Mind

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,420
through non-combative means these

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,159
techniques are used by military and

41
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,259
political forces to influence the

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,220
beliefs emotions behaviors of citizens

43
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,680
at the end of the day it's all marketing

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,079
but instead of a product they're selling

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,919
you an ideal

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,899
now for some history

47
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,320
it was the year 329 BC and Alexander the

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,500
Great was conquering Empires all around

49
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,180
he quickly took over large parts of

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,220
Europe and the Middle East

51
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,800
as his army started taking over more and

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,900
more land the number of soldiers he had

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,760
to defend those Newfound territories

54
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,760
started to dwindle causing Alexander to

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,620
wonder if he could keep all his Newfound

56
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,080
territory to himself

57
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,720
that's when Alexander the Great had a

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
brilliant idea that would intimidate the

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,340
enemy without having to do much work at

60
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,140
all

61
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,840
after conquering a new city Alexander

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,660
had his armies leave behind large pieces

63
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,000
of armor that would fit a seven foot

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,640
tall giant when the enemy soldiers

65
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,099
passed by they would see massive chest

66
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,739
plates helmets and Boots this surely

67
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,140
intimidated the opponents making them

68
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,300
wonder if they could ever win a battle

69
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,819
against Alexander at the Great's army of

70
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,299
giants

71
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,700
years later Genghis Khan also proved

72
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,040
that the power of intimidation could go

73
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,280
a long way before attacking a city he

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,080
would send Messengers ahead to tell of

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
the horrible huge Army that was coming

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,420
to attack when the presumably huge Army

77
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,940
was approaching all you could see was a

78
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,459
massive dust storm coming your way this

79
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,440
wasn't caused by soldiers in the Army

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,140
but rather by rocks and heavy objects

81
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,819
that the horses dragged along behind

82
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,280
them creating the illusion of a large

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,200
army

84
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,260
his archers also shot arrows that would

85
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,720
whistle in the air further intimidating

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,560
the enemy

87
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,720
now we will jump ahead to World War one

88
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,319
and World War II back in 1914 the

89
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,360
Germans were the first to send pamphlets

90
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,239
to the enemy troops after observing how

91
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,220
well this tactic worked the United

92
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,500
States decided to jump in and make some

93
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,659
propaganda of Their Own

94
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,120
these leaflets had topics such as how

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,400
successful the American troops were and

96
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,140
how poorly the German troops were doing

97
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,879
each Nation used propaganda on their own

98
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,280
citizens as well their goal was to get

99
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,620
them to enlist in the military or to

100
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,299
have them send money and supplies to the

101
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,659
Troops

102
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,639
in the Vietnam War the U.S military

103
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,639
played a soundtrack called ghost tape

104
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,580
number 10. and yes this is the actual

105
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,860
picture of the ghost tape someone did

106
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,419
actually just draw that little Doodle

107
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,599
there

108
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,040
they did this in the Vietnamese jungles

109
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,199
at night to persuade the troops to

110
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,699
surrender

111
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,979
the U.S forces hope that the operation

112
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,560
codenamed wandering Soul would prey on

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,259
the fears of many Vietnamese

114
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,540
the Vietnamese culture includes beliefs

115
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,460
and rituals showing respect to the dead

116
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,800
they believe if a person is not properly

117
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,380
buried they will wander the Earth as a

118
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,180
Wandering soul

119
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,759
hence the name

120
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,400
let's go to the Gulf War in the Gulf War

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,800
psychological tactics were very

122
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,780
successful because they threatened

123
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,240
consequences to those who did not abide

124
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,479
by the coalition's rules

125
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,940
the American Military also promised the

126
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,280
Iraqi troops that no harm would come to

127
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,440
them and they would be treated very well

128
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,139
if they surrendered

129
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,240
these messages were delivered by

130
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,919
air-dropping pamphlets over the

131
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,539
battlefield

132
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,300
and many Iraqi troops surrendered

133
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,919
holding that very pamphlet

134
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,740
messages were also delivered by radio as

135
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,539
it was one of the few options the

136
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,340
soldiers in the field had to distract

137
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,919
themselves from the war the Arabs also

138
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,840
tried some psyops tactics on the

139
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,360
coalition's forces using a broadcaster

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
by the name of Baghdad Betty she told

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,940
the soldiers that while they were off at

142
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,400
War their wives were at home sleeping

143
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,440
with celebrities such as

144
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
Mel Gibson

145
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,139
Tom Cruise and Bart Simpson

146
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,620
but wait

147
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,300
that's not true

148
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,280
the whole Bart Simpson thing was just

149
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,100
part of a Johnny Carson monologue in the

150
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,520
1990s the Press changed Homer to Bart

151
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,520
and that comment went viral or at least

152
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,639
as viral as something can get in the 90s

153
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,319
and that comment became a fact

154
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,720
this illustrates why you need to fact

155
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,259
check your media anyways you may be

156
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,840
wondering how a tiny piece of paper or a

157
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,000
radio message can make a soldier give up

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,759
all they have already sacrificed and how

159
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,160
warning messages can intimidate entire

160
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,300
armies

161
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,699
to answer these questions let's take a

162
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,699
deeper look into the prior examples

163
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,340
before any psyops attack is used on an

164
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,220
enemy they are usually tired hungry

165
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,340
stressed and even depressed this makes

166
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,259
them even more susceptible to

167
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,600
psychological manipulation

168
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,419
additionally all propaganda ties into

169
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,419
one or more of the

170
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,319
seven deadly sins lust

171
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,960
gluttony Pride sloth wrath greed and

172
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,840
envy these seven sins are the greatest

173
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,539
desires known to humankind so avoiding

174
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,220
these feelings in such a horrible

175
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,180
condition is virtually impossible

176
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,680
additionally they play on the strong

177
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,900
human emotions of

178
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,819
anger

179
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,199
fear

180
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,620
and hate these emotions are also the

181
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,560
easiest to stir up in an individual with

182
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,300
that in mind let's look back on

183
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,280
Alexander the Great and why he left

184
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,919
behind those large pieces of armor keep

185
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,139
in mind back then the average height was

186
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,840
much shorter than people today picture

187
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,000
yourself as one of these soldiers

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,580
tracking down Alexander's Army and

189
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,620
finding pieces of armor that are twice

190
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,960
the size of yours that would definitely

191
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,940
strike fear in your heart

192
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,460
Genghis Khan used the power of false

193
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,800
numbers to his Advantage as he stormed

194
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,900
through the cities and towns

195
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,539
this time imagine yourself as a soldier

196
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,900
in a city near a Dusty plain that goes

197
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,720
on as far as the eye can see suddenly

198
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
you hear what you believe to be

199
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,919
thousands of horse Hooves coming your

200
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,740
way a huge cloud of dust appears as you

201
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,599
watch your certain Doom approaching

202
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,000
practically engulfing your seemingly

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,179
tiny Army by comparison again fear was

204
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,140
the emotion used here

205
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,940
in the times of World War One and World

206
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,979
War II you would see propaganda

207
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,020
everywhere in your town coming forms

208
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,020
such as posters Billboards newspaper ads

209
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,839
and pamphlets these posters included

210
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,600
Singh such as I want you for the US Army

211
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,540
which plays on pride and he volunteered

212
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,540
for submarine service which plays on

213
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,800
lust

214
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
that covers things back home but what

215
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,320
about campaigns on the front lines

216
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,540
because of the British blockade getting

217
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,880
food to Germany was virtually impossible

218
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,740
leaving the German troops with little

219
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,760
rations

220
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,100
this gave the British idea to send out

221
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,380
leaflets with pictures of their soldiers

222
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,600
eating great food and smiling brightly

223
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,360
many men went to sleep hungry that night

224
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,880
holding that leaflet this is the perfect

225
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,899
example of gluttony in a psyops campaign

226
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,600
now picture yourself as a Vietnamese

227
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,640
Soldier walking through a dark damp

228
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,220
jungle in the middle of the night you're

229
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,800
tired hungry and just want to go back

230
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,080
home to your family who you haven't seen

231
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,440
in weeks when suddenly you hear the

232
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,360
sound of your fellow soldiers who have

233
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,700
died their souls wandering Through the

234
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,800
Jungle forever and the Eerie sounds of

235
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,320
Buddhist funeral music screaming crying

236
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,120
and the sounds of ghosts and spirits

237
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,420
let's take a listen to wandering soul

238
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,420
foreign

239
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,289
[Music]

240
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,800
again you're in the jungle at night

241
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,680
while this is playing and you think your

242
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,800
haunted houses are scary

243
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,040
foreign

244
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,740
at the time of the Gulf War the U.S sent

245
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,660
pamphlets out to the Arabian soldiers

246
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,760
telling them that if they surrendered

247
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,860
they would treat them very well and no

248
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,260
harm would come to them these pamphlets

249
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,579
were designed with the help of

250
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,640
Cooperative Iraqi prisoners of War they

251
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,920
advise against using the color red and

252
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,720
to feature Soldiers with bowls of fruits

253
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,019
including bananas bananas are a delicacy

254
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,060
to the Arabians this played on the sins

255
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,540
of greed and gluttony

256
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,480
back then they put propaganda wherever a

257
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,040
large number of people would see it

258
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,140
every day like posters at a grocery

259
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,019
store or as in a newspaper these days

260
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,959
what is a widely used means of sharing

261
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,979
opinions and information

262
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:24,000
that's right social media

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
82 percent of U.S citizens have a social

264
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,579
media profile most likely you have one

265
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,079
too

266
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,959
propaganda used to be a blunt tool that

267
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,360
had to be tailored to appeal to a large

268
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,459
General audience

269
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,700
with social media ads can be targeted

270
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,540
directly to a specific demographic

271
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,820
there are many social media platforms

272
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,420
but today we will be focusing on two of

273
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,000
the big ones Facebook and Twitter

274
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,800
have you ever noticed that your social

275
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,740
media ads seem to be targeting you the

276
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,540
other day you were looking up cupcake

277
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,700
recipes and suddenly your Facebook feed

278
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,459
is recommending the bacon baking topic

279
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,920
and ads for mixers

280
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,320
that is because the algorithm is

281
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,300
targeting You by tracking your likes

282
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,519
searches who you follow and who you

283
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,060
interact with

284
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,920
you also have a digital fingerprint that

285
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,040
ties all your devices your searches apps

286
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,019
and pretty much everything you do online

287
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,519
together

288
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,200
Facebook and Twitter know you better

289
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,959
than you know yourself the data from the

290
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,820
algorithm helps them recommend topics

291
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,579
and advertisements to you if you have

292
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,200
already done some research in modern

293
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,500
psyops this name will be no stranger to

294
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,839
you

295
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,180
Cambridge analytica

296
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,459
Cambridge analytica was a political

297
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,279
consulting firm that used large data

298
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,560
sets to Target and change the minds of

299
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,480
Voters

300
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,639
though the parent company was located in

301
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,740
Great Britain they saw a huge

302
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,279
opportunity in the United States back in

303
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,339
2016 Consultants working for the Donald

304
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,920
Trump's presidential campaign sought out

305
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,680
Cambridge analytica to help him and his

306
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,060
campaign team

307
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,180
Trump's campaign spent over 44 million

308
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,839
dollars to run 5.9 million Facebook ads

309
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,660
at its peak Cambridge analytica was

310
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,779
spending over 1 million dollars a day on

311
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,720
Facebook ads alone meanwhile Hillary

312
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,019
Clinton's campaign spent 28 million on

313
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,839
66 000 ads quite a difference

314
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,139
all of this starts with Facebook

315
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,279
personality surveys

316
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,860
Jane baumbauer who is Professor of law

317
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,079
at the University of Arizona best

318
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,000
describes how these surveys started out

319
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,600
in 2014 Alexander kogan who is a young

320
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,060
Professor at Cambridge University made a

321
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,519
personality quiz called this is your

322
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,380
digital life that attempted to

323
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,480
categorize the people who took it into a

324
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,760
set of psychological profiles

325
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
almost everyone who took the quiz agreed

326
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,519
to let him access not only their public

327
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,079
account information

328
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,839
all of their information including every

329
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,480
like dislike and follow

330
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,079
but also the profiles of their friends

331
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,300
that's how a few hundred thousand survey

332
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,660
takers grew into a database of 87

333
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,779
million people and even though only a

334
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,279
few hundred thousand took the

335
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,500
personality quiz that mapped out their

336
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,139
psychometric profile the researchers

337
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,660
could use their result to build a

338
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,399
statistical model that could then

339
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,560
predict the psychometric profiles of the

340
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,860
other 86 million Facebook users

341
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,320
the profiles were then provided to the

342
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,420
researchers Company Cambridge alinica

343
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,180
which used them as assets to try to get

344
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,820
political Consulting clients like

345
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,320
Donald Trump

346
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,279
in 2015 Facebook changed its policies to

347
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,079
restrict how third-party companies

348
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,079
collect information from Facebook users

349
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,060
by the time the change was implemented

350
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,300
Cambridge analytica had already received

351
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,079
the data hence it was kind of too late

352
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,240
they use these Facebook personality

353
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,339
surveys to sort people in a few main

354
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,920
categories the survey coupled with other

355
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,740
Facebook data created what is known as

356
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,980
an ocean score ocean also known as the

357
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,279
big five stands for openness

358
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,500
conscientiousness extroversion

359
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,540
agreeableness and neuroticism

360
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,060
depending on your ocean score they would

361
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,880
determine if you are a persuadable AKA

362
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,920
someone whose political views can be

363
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,760
easily swayed

364
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,620
they didn't Target their ads at all the

365
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,139
persuadables they only focused on the

366
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,480
swing States Florida Wisconsin

367
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,300
Pennsylvania and Michigan

368
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,980
they knew if they flipped these few

369
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,980
States they could win the election in

370
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,899
order to swing the persuadables they

371
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,019
created ad campaigns

372
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,120
one example of an ad campaign that

373
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,699
Cambridge analytica created was the

374
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,279
Crooked Hillary campaign

375
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,940
the logo included handcuffs as the Ooze

376
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,180
in crooked and their slogan was lock her

377
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,599
up

378
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,540
their art Department would create many

379
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,399
uncredited images and post them to

380
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,100
Facebook people who receive these ads

381
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,560
would not only like and share the ad but

382
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,120
would screenshot it and share it to

383
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,639
other social media platforms effectively

384
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,860
free advertising

385
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,139
Cambridge analytica created the spark

386
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,540
and social media became the flame ending

387
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,980
with the explosive 2016 election results

388
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,440
it is likely we will never again have

389
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,600
free and fair elections where candidates

390
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,320
are chosen by their platform and ideas

391
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,839
instead of lies in fake advertising

392
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,420
as you can see these ads use childish

393
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,059
bullying tactics such as name calling as

394
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,639
well as playing on wrath fear and pride

395
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,500
Cambridge was at its high point

396
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,319
following the 2016 elections when

397
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,959
whistleblowers like Brittany Kaiser and

398
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,240
Chris Wiley decided to take a stand

399
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,760
against the company after pleading

400
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,980
guilty for taking people's personal data

401
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,640
and refusing to give it back the company

402
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,700
declared bankruptcy and shut down for

403
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,540
good

404
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,820
but this can't be the end of the story

405
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,340
what happened to all that data that was

406
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,679
collected I'm sure it wasn't simply

407
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,500
deleted it's no surprise that their

408
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,880
business closing opened up a new era of

409
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,880
disinformation for hire

410
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,620
social media has the tools to sow

411
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,380
disinformation at scale to affect

412
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,240
anything from a small local government

413
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,400
election to spreading disinformation

414
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,340
about covid-19 vaccines or even

415
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,120
upsetting a country's elections

416
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,220
this can be seen today as Spanish

417
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,039
language anti-vaccine ads are pushed on

418
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:14,880
Facebook

419
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,740
it really makes you wonder where this

420
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,140
disinformation is coming from and what

421
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,740
their goal is

422
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,780
an example of influencing elections

423
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,960
Cambridge analytica was able to flip the

424
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,100
elections in Trinidad and Tobago

425
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,200
they were hired by the majority which

426
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,960
was the Indian United National Congress

427
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,020
party to defeat the incumbent people's

428
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,120
national movement which primarily

429
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,240
attracts afro-trim bangunian voters

430
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,820
they researched both audiences and

431
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
decided to Target the young voters they

432
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,059
knew the young Indian UNC voters would

433
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,740
do what their parents told them to do

434
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,419
and they would go out and vote for the

435
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:00,360
UNC so they focused their efforts on the

436
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,100
afro-trim bengonian voters

437
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,100
they created a campaign called do so to

438
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,320
increase apathy towards voting and

439
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,260
politics in general encouraging them not

440
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,039
to vote did this tactic work

441
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,700
yes it did the United National Congress

442
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,520
party won the election in case you are

443
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,740
thinking this is recent news this

444
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,860
happened back in 2010 meaning that this

445
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,720
sort of election manipulation has been

446
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,000
going on for a long time

447
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,280
besides creating campaigns and posting

448
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,799
to social media these private firms

449
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,539
offer the ultimate power and

450
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,539
disinformation campaigning

451
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,539
deniability

452
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,660
governments and political figures can

453
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,460
contract these disinformation companies

454
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,460
to do their dirty work making it very

455
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,820
difficult to trace it back to the source

456
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,039
content Farms Produce thousands of

457
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
legitimate looking accounts complete

458
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,240
with an untraceable unique profile

459
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,520
picture and a posting history

460
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,100
the bonuses real people spread these

461
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,780
conspiracies and lives by sharing and

462
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,780
reposing on multiple platforms giving a

463
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,940
huge return on a relatively small

464
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,220
investment

465
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,799
if you tell a lie big enough and keep

466
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,320
repeating it people will eventually come

467
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,360
to believe it

468
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,640
Donald Trump has been doing this even

469
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,400
before he was out of office he told his

470
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,440
constituents that if he didn't win the

471
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,200
election it was rigged conditioning his

472
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
followers to rise up if he did not win

473
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,820
once election results were certified and

474
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,039
Joe Biden was declared the winner Trump

475
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,679
started claiming the election was rigged

476
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,780
stirring up a wrath in his followers

477
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,900
leading to the January 6 attack on the

478
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,039
capitol

479
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,500
Trump still tells this lie that the

480
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,539
election was rigged despite the total

481
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,880
lack of evidence yet his followers

482
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,740
believe it

483
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,020
the underlying message to his followers

484
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,240
is if you don't win something it's

485
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,740
because it was stolen from you

486
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,140
Cambridge analytica wasn't the only one

487
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,660
persuading voters in the U.S Russian

488
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,820
actors also use social media to cause

489
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,460
havoc and divide the country why in the

490
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,500
world would Russia do this like

491
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,720
Cambridge analytica they are not out to

492
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,440
gain money but rather power

493
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,980
Soviet Premier Khrushchev said we do not

494
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,320
have to invade the United States we will

495
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,960
destroy you from within that is exactly

496
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,880
what Russia is doing dividing the

497
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,799
country so it destroys itself from

498
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,158
within

499
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,900
the Russian actors created Facebook

500
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,059
accounts and groups as well as Twitter

501
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,880
Bots all impersonating U.S citizens in

502
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,500
organized groups

503
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,620
one example of this is

504
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,620
self-united

505
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,620
as you can see right here

506
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,360
this ad was paid for in Rubles

507
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,179
you can also see the interest tags they

508
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,720
use take a look at some of them

509
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,539
stop a legal and immigration

politics Fox News

512
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,220
people who follow these accounts also

513
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,559
like and repost the content one of the

514
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,659
ad tools on Facebook allows you to send

515
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:31,080
ads to friends and people you follow you

516
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,760
can then pick from thousands of

517
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,340
different keywords targeting even more

518
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,140
interest groups

519
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,299
the Russians also make fake news

520
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,640
websites that appear to be real news

521
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,100
sources but are actually fake

522
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,900
when Bob goes on Facebook and reads an

523
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,600
article on how Hillary is crooked he

524
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
probably won't check where it came from

525
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,640
but he will like and repost it and so

526
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,919
that all his friends can do the same

527
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,240
the younger audience may be thinking

528
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,059
yeah of course it's fake I can tell that

529
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,919
but you have to understand that the

530
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,539
older audience not trying to Target

531
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,299
anyone was brought up believing all new

532
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,299
sources are fully fact checked they have

533
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,980
applied this belief to all modern

534
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,100
delivery platforms after all Facebook is

535
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,480
where I connect with my friends and

536
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,419
family why would Facebook lie to me

537
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,580
this news article must be real because

538
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,880
the site it's on looks real turns out

539
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,340
this newspaper's mailing address is in a

540
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,500
shopping mall between Forever 21 and

541
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,940
Claire's

542
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,400
there's also a building in Washington DC

543
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,280
that is full of mailboxes this gives any

544
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,020
blogger living in his parents basement

545
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,419
the ability to list legitimate sounding

546
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,820
physical addresses at the bottom of his

547
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,679
new site making it seem even more

548
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,020
realistic

549
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,539
an interesting fact is that the Russians

550
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,419
Target both sides not just one like

551
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:00,120
Cambridge did this way they can divide

552
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,059
and conquer in the U.S Russian influence

553
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,600
reached over 126 million people through

554
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,179
Facebook alone

555
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,400
they created fake black lives matter

556
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,620
memes that when you clicked on them you

557
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,480
were taken to Pages inviting you to a

558
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,940
protest at the same time they were

559
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,980
targeting adversary groups like blue

560
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,380
lives matter with similar fake Pages

561
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,020
inviting them to a protest at the same

562
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,200
location on the same day

563
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,120
the Russian government is organizing

564
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,340
face-to-face protests in order to get us

565
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,380
to fight with each other and divide the

566
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,220
country

567
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,860
so far we have talked about Facebook but

568
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,120
when you think about political

569
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,299
discussions your mind goes straight to

570
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:46,080
the dumpster fire that is Twitter

571
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,659
just like Facebook Twitter is used by

572
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,400
Russians and other groups is so

573
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,100
disinformation to the American populace

574
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,140
many using the same techniques that are

575
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,419
used on Facebook one big problem with

576
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,480
Twitter is the low bar for entry this

577
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,280
allows groups to use tools that create

578
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,039
many bot accounts very quickly these

579
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,080
accounts go and tweet the same things

580
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,299
once the bot gets caught and blocked

581
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,520
they simply create a new batch of

582
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,020
accounts

583
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,659
the Twitter Bots also retweet other Bots

584
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,820
tweets as is shown in this beautiful

585
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,559
graphic by Daniel Gallagher

586
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,620
going back to the seven deadly sins in

587
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,200
lust the bot accounts frequently feature

588
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
beautiful young woman because the target

589
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
audience is primarily male voters

590
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,700
take this account for example these

591
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,559
photos were stolen off a Colombian

592
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,279
Instagram influencers account

593
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,840
you've had some history and some

594
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,720
examples now let's walk through a psyops

595
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,940
campaign together for this campaign

596
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,000
let's say Elon Musk is coming to Romania

597
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,440
for Halloween

598
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,840
oh wait that's already been done before

599
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,678
oops

600
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,640
so let's come up with something new

601
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,279
there are six basic steps to a psyops

602
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,360
campaign

603
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,539
plan target audience series development

604
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,299
product design dissemination and

605
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,240
evaluation for our example I will be

606
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,799
combining some of these steps together

607
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,080
for the sake of time

608
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,900
first is planning in this phase you

609
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,640
determine your goal and who your target

610
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,100
audience is for our example the

611
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,740
objective will be convincing Bob that

612
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,299
unicorns are real

613
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:31,559
so let's call this operation Twilight

614
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,260
for any operation it helps to give your

615
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,360
target audience an individual identity

616
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,279
this makes a series development and

617
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,620
product design much easier that's why we

618
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,900
have created Bob not trying to Target

619
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,299
anyone named Bob

620
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,360
next we refine our target audience we

621
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,900
chose Bob but who is Bob we picked Bob

622
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,340
because he does many Facebook

623
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,860
personality surveys and through those we

624
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,220
found out he was a persuadable he's also

625
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,919
very active online with his friends this

626
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,600
will be a force multiplier to our

627
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,460
operation

628
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,799
now that we have our objective and our

629
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,100
target audience let's move on to

630
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,340
series development and product design

631
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,440
I put these two together because they

632
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,000
pretty much happen hand in hand during

633
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,500
an operation

634
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,600
though it seems logical we can't just

635
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,419
make an ad that says

636
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:26,820
unicorns are real and be done

637
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,860
Bob will laugh at it and move on much

638
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,779
like you guys would it has nothing to do

639
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,640
with his interests

640
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,039
what we need to do is slowly pull Bob

641
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,960
through a series of targeted ads and

642
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,600
psyops that convince him unicorns are

643
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,840
real

644
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,820
first we'll send out some articles from

645
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,460
our fake online newspaper that is made

646
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,159
to look like a legitimate popular site

647
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,740
the article talks about how scientists

648
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,080
have managed to splice the DNA of a

649
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,360
narwhal with the DNA of a horse causing

650
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,459
horses to grow a horn

651
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,159
this article will have links to our

652
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,200
scientific journal with more articles on

653
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,360
how DNA splicing Works complete with the

654
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
case study of unicorn gene splicing we

655
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,679
can also add legitimate sounding

656
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,659
scientific names and quotes

657
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,640
how did we create this fancy looking

658
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,039
thing we found some random scientific

659
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,080
journal thingy online and replaced some

660
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,059
of the words with horse and unicorn it's

661
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,220
easy

662
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,740
soon after these similar articles will

663
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,140
be posted one being on how scientists

664
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,360
have managed to manipulate the horn DNA

665
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,580
to determine its length allowing our

666
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,799
unicorns to have a more normal looking

667
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,600
horn

668
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,539
next our art department will generate

669
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,000
pictures of unicorns and since Bob is a

670
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,220
bit of a conspiracy nut we will make

671
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,020
them look as if the pictures come from

672
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,179
surveillance camera footage and hidden

673
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,559
camera shots

674
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,720
Bob will love this and share these

675
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,480
photos with his friends his friends who

676
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,220
share similar interests with him believe

677
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,220
it but others are more skeptical when

678
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,559
his friends laugh at him he will simply

679
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,360
share the links to our newspaper in

680
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,340
scientific journals causing many of them

681
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,620
to join Bob as a unicorn convert

682
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,020
dissemination dissemination has been

683
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,059
happening through Facebook ads that look

684
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,399
like legitimate news articles we can

685
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,080
also credit a scientific podcast which

686
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,880
interviews the scientists who made the

687
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,120
Unicorn again all fake this podcast will

688
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,340
be supported by our numerous fake

689
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,500
Twitter and Instagram accounts we are

690
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,440
using to spread photos of our unicorn

691
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,799
finally we evaluated our operation turns

692
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,020
out it worked not only did we convince

693
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,299
Bob that unicorns were real he also used

694
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,340
our propaganda to convince his friends

695
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,580
they were real as a bonus Bob started a

696
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,380
Blog about unicorns further spreading

697
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,679
the message

698
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,559
today you got some history

699
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,740
some psyops and a heavy dose of reality

700
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,279
but this is a ton of information if only

701
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,200
there was a project or a tool out there

702
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,240
that can help me navigate this scary

703
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,880
world I present to you

704
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,580
tanbe

705
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,220
tonbe is a collaboration between qatars

706
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,460
Computing Research Institute mit's sea

707
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,240
sale in Bulgaria's Sofia University this

708
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,820
project uses AI to analyze news articles

709
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,100
and other media sources to see how

710
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,020
biased they are what their political

711
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,480
alignment is and whether or not they are

712
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,419
generating propaganda like anything the

713
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,340
results you obtain from their tools

714
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,679
should be used with other research to

715
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,960
determine the factuality of a media

716
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,380
source

717
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,880
we'll be focusing on their news

718
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,159
aggregator and their article analysis

719
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,980
tool they also have other tools you can

720
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,960
explore if you are interested as shown

721
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,200
here

722
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,620
they also have a few Publications under

723
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,659
their name in case you want to do some

724
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,580
research on them it's not that many

725
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,020
Publications though I'm sorry

726
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,360
yeah just a few Publications that's all

727
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,640
let's talk about their news source tool

728
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,039
their new source tool allows you to go

729
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,380
on popular news sites and get an

730
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,580
analysis on them so let's look at CNN

731
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,039
first it will give you a Wikipedia

732
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,159
description of what CNN is it will show

733
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,840
its centrality and its hyper

734
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,559
partisanship

735
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,179
then it will show its likelihood to have

736
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:00,000
propaganda as you can see it's very

737
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,440
unlikely which is really good

738
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,659
next it will show you what topics they

739
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,179
carry on so they talk a lot about

740
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,880
cultural identity political topics and

741
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,960
economical topics

742
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,880
then it will give you analysis on how

743
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,340
factual it is or well How likely it is

744
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,799
to be factual and it's very likely which

745
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,220
is good

746
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,679
next it shows its political leaning as

747
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,000
you can see it's a very left Center

748
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,679
then it shows its target audience which

749
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,399
is liberal

750
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,919
a cool thing is it also shows you its

751
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,440
Twitter bias Which is far left or left

752
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,480
then it goes on and shows the different

753
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,940
topics that agrees and disagrees on and

754
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,159
how much it does this one's on climate

755
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,779
change they also have one on brexit

756
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,299
Alternative Energy immigration death

757
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:00,240
penalty and more

758
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,240
they also have it for Fox News as shown

759
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,020
here

760
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,840
its centrality is lower

761
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,760
How likely

762
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,960
um it is to have propaganda is also not

763
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,100
as likely

764
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,220
um the factuality of reporting is more

765
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,620
mixed a little scary

766
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,539
and here you can see its political

767
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,880
ideology it's interesting that the AI

768
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,419
Fox News as both left Center and right

769
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,460
as you can see its target audience is

770
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,740
very conservative no surprise there

771
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,440
and it's Twitter bias

772
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,700
far right on everything

773
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,120
okay but that's about the new sites

774
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,860
what about the actual articles

775
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,559
themselves next we will look at their

776
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,500
article analysis tool you have the

777
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,140
option to just paste the URL to a site

778
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,539
or copy the text from the article in the

779
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,059
tool we found it best to use the text

780
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,519
option as using the URL we'll also put

781
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,260
in the search engine optimization

782
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,560
keywords and skew the results a little

783
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,020
for this sample we grabbed a random

784
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,139
article from Fox News

785
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,780
first it shows its bias analysis of that

786
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,699
article and it shows that it's leaning

787
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,260
more right

788
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,320
it shows its propaganda score

789
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,379
and then it goes on to the actual

790
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,199
article itself and it highlights some

791
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,260
key words or phrases that it finds and

792
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,119
it highlights some based on colors going

793
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,739
with all the things you can see on the

794
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,780
right which I will zoom into there you

795
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,480
go and it talks about this and flags

796
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,280
them off so like if it has exaggeration

797
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,980
bandwagging loaded language slogans and

798
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,980
name calling doubt

799
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,580
oversimplification Etc

800
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,500
and over here it can show you the

801
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,440
probability that it is factual going

802
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,359
from the most probable to the least

803
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,400
okay that tool is cool but what else can

804
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,960
I do

805
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,480
one you can install an ad blocker this

806
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,880
way you only get feed and not targeted

807
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,040
information

808
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,680
two don't take any online quizzes or

809
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,660
surveys I know it's tempting to find out

810
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,760
what flavor of ice cream you are but

811
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,079
it's best not to give out personal

812
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,079
information a simple or minor as it may

813
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,700
seem

814
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,220
three when reading an article always

815
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,579
check the sources and who wrote it don't

816
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,500
forget to compare it with other articles

817
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,839
from trusted sites and last but not

818
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:40,980
least

819
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,079
four always make sure to fact check

820
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,540
everything you see and read and never

821
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,460
base your opinion on just one thing and

822
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,339
learn with both sides have to say before

823
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,220
forming an opinion for yourself

824
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,380
even though social media can be a scary

825
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,960
place it can also be educational and a

826
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,000
lot of fun you just need to balance it

827
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,119
with reality go outside touch some grass

828
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,339
get some fresh air

829
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:08,040
and with that I'm bsylab and you can

830
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,720
follow me on these social media sites

831
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,670
thank you

832
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,459
[Applause]
