1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
okay it's obviously good to see

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,500
everybody I think this is my first talk

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,559
in with an audience since like two years

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,880
um

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,139
so

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,859
I wanted to do this talk because I see

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,180
that there's a lot of misconceptions

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,520
about how to run security I mean I know

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,500
it sounds arrogant and maybe it is a

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,539
little bit some of you who know me know

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,560
that I'm a very humble person

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,420
okay but

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,320
um

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,480
we're not going to go through all the

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,360
CIS controls and all the pen tests and

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,280
all the things that you normally do in

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,059
any

18
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,760
uh security group or in any organization

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,620
but more I want to kind of run through

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,860
some unorthodox or tough to swallow

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,180
pills when it comes to running security

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,700
I'm going to skip through about me just

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,920
to tell you that I was a bit Defender

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
for about 18 years and since May 2022

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,539
I'm running security with an awesome

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,700
team for the superbet group and

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,740
happening XYZ

28
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,540
because we have don't have a lot of time

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,220
and we have a lot of stuff to cover so

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,659
I'm going to kind of rush through a few

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,680
things right so

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
about the group

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,700
so

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,439
about 4 500 employees 10 countries

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,479
no battery

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,000
we have a number of companies under the

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
group's umbrella and this is an

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,220
important thing to keep in mind because

39
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,960
each company kind of comes with their

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,479
own kind of worms

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,180
ah

42
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,280
I don't think I can I'm gonna just stick

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,619
to being here because of the battery

44
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,420
and The Happening XYZ because many have

45
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,380
asked me

46
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,000
is the new engine

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,460
okay so happening XYZ is the new engine

48
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,100
that powers the technology behind the

49
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,820
superbed group

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,340
disclaimers we will not talk about how

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,160
to cheat at slot machines and sports

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,980
betting and

53
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,379
clickbait Brothers

54
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,120
I know I said place your bets and

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,379
everybody's like oh my God we're going

56
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,780
to learn how to cheat no

57
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,640
um we're not going to learn how to

58
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,040
handle cheating and cheaters and how we

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,379
you know break their hands and you know

60
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,300
Crush their feet and whatnot like you've

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,800
seen in casino

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,959
uh we're not going to talk about the

63
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,959
inner workings of how we place odds and

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,220
all that stuff to be honest I have

65
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,440
actually have very little idea I have

66
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,420
never stepped even even set foot in one

67
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,000
of those agencies or whatever I've never

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
placed a bet in my life

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,980
I did play in Vegas which is like

70
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,720
unavoidable

71
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,879
and we'll not talk about again

72
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,780
stock 2 price for 27001

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,140
cheese controls and boring conversation

74
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,379
anyway

75
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,959
we will talk about challenges technical

76
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,459
challenges and political challenges

77
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,500
because when you want to implement new

78
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,239
policies especially tough to swallow

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,319
policies you're going to face resistance

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,940
and we're going to talk about again

81
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,739
Concepts that some of you will find

82
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,459
controversial but my hope is that

83
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,239
it will either you know

84
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,580
shed a new light on things for you

85
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,500
or it will Empower you to go back and

86
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,780
say you know I knew it and this is some

87
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,159
more ammunition that I can take back

88
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,739
home with me and use it to talk to the

89
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,900
guys that you know are resisting what

90
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,700
I'm trying to tell them

91
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,680
again about the group

92
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,680
very important engineering teams in most

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,200
countries we have a few technology hubs

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,340
very siled okay so because we acquire

95
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,019
a number of companies and we're going to

96
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,299
probably keep acquiring new companies so

97
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,040
one of the bigger challenges is how do

98
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,080
we keep our sanity in managing the

99
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,099
security

100
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,920
for you know while we ingest new

101
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,180
companies and making sure that they're

102
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,620
going to be safe as well

103
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,599
and do it in a predictable fashion and

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,459
without bothering them too much

105
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,480
so um

106
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,459
again some of the entities are very

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,019
autonomous and they want to keep their

108
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,760
autonomy

109
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,580
so this is our main objective to be able

110
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,259
to manage the security for all of these

111
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,919
companies to be able to you know do it

112
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,040
in an efficient way predictable way and

113
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,800
most importantly don't bother the users

114
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,180
very much because developers are

115
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,740
primatonas

116
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,860
they don't want to change their way of

117
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,520
life they have some preconceptions I'm

118
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,720
going to say a few things and some of

119
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,160
the developers in Juris are going to go

120
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,220
like no no no I don't want to do that

121
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,820
and yeah it's a tough it's a tough job

122
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,840
this is a structure we have what we call

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,440
a green team

124
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,639
um handling compliance

125
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
their job is to make sure that everybody

126
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,800
knows what they're supposed to be doing

127
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,759
so any policy that we push any any you

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,740
know new policy any New Concept that we

129
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,900
want people to be aware of the job of

130
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,120
the green team is to transform it into a

131
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,639
policy and communicate it internally

132
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,580
we have a blue team

133
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,740
The Blue Team obviously handles handles

134
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,020
pretty much straightforward defenses and

135
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,580
incident response not going to bother

136
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,020
you too much with this

137
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,960
and we have a red pin

138
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,820
and this is these are the actual people

139
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,620
on the team I think that around here

140
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,039
somewhere okay

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,600
a very important thing about the red

142
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
team the red team in our case at least

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,479
operates with a rogue mentality

144
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,220
Rogue mentality

145
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,199
is something that's a luxury for red

146
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,960
teams in most organizations

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,940
in most organizations red team have to

148
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,740
announce when they hack something or

149
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,180
when they pen test something or when

150
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,240
they try to do something with the system

151
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,759
we have managed to kind of get agreement

152
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,800
across the board to allow directing Free

153
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,380
Will free reign and acting like a

154
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,840
completely Rogue element with inside

155
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,100
information

156
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,360
so

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,860
anything that they want to do anything

158
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,900
that they want to shoot they are allowed

159
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,479
to shoot okay so license to hack pretty

160
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,380
much

161
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,259
and we I strongly encourage you to kind

162
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,180
of try to push this mentality because

163
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,000
obviously hackers will not play by the

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,199
rules

165
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,139
so an important aspect of directing is

166
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,180
to think like a hacker obviously

167
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,600
and push the boundaries and the limits

168
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,220
of the engineering and the blue teams

169
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,660
and all the other teams in the

170
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,819
organization push their limits towards

171
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,560
being resilient against real life

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,900
attacks not just simulations internal

173
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,160
simulations

174
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,520
so first very important takeaway Rogue

175
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,319
mentality and free reign for direct team

176
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,600
if you don't do this you're gonna have a

177
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,240
less resilient security posture

178
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,060
the most underrated team

179
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,039
and one of the key elements about

180
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,720
keeping our sanity

181
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,900
is the compliance team they're like the

182
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,080
most boring unit ever they write those

183
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,460
ugly documents

184
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,680
with policies that nobody bothers to

185
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,599
read

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,180
but it's the most important unit in the

187
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,560
organization about keeping car sanity

188
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,599
anybody that can tell me why or at least

189
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,520
show off hands

190
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
I know they're boring so nobody of one

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,620
hand raised I know they're boring

192
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,139
well

193
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,960
they're they're the unit that kind of

194
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,319
enables everybody in the group so in all

195
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,680
the 4 500 employees all the I don't know

196
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,360
how many I literally don't know how many

197
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,039
companies we have

198
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,020
they're the ones that tell them how

199
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,759
things should work and they're the ones

200
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,020
that are supposed to design those

201
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,580
documents in a way

202
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,500
that are easy to understand and easy to

203
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,300
adopt by everybody else

204
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,800
so when we say stuff like you know we

205
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,780
want SSO everywhere or we want you know

206
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,539
waffs everywhere or pen test before

207
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,220
anything else goes in production all of

208
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,840
these things need to be documented and

209
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,819
communicated internally and this

210
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,500
communication is probably the most

211
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,360
important aspect about anything we do

212
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,400
not just in security but in most of the

213
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,720
actions that we do this internal

214
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,220
communication and predictability and

215
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,020
allowing the other departments to know

216
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,280
what we're doing

217
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,319
is one of those important aspects

218
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,419
because nobody likes surprises nobody

219
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,340
likes to wake up with a whatever new

220
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,080
software on their computer or whatever

221
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,179
new limitations at the very or at the

222
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,339
perimeter and so on and so forth

223
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,958
one of the key elements of running a

224
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,779
successful green team is having a

225
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,179
shorter version of those long shitty

226
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,260
documents

227
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,420
so there's the shitty document with a

228
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,800
version number will be the approval

229
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,320
stamp with whatever that again nobody

230
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,399
reads

231
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,100
and we keep a shorter version of that of

232
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,380
a too long didn't read version or notion

233
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,600
or whatever Confluence Wiki you have

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,339
internally so make sure that you always

235
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,220
have a short version of all the policies

236
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,839
second

237
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,060
any policy that you have should apply to

238
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,500
the entire group

239
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,779
I mean and this is a particular case for

240
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,440
us because again multiple companies so

241
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,180
if you have just one company then yeah

242
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,500
you have a policy for the whole company

243
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,480
but if you have multiple companies you

244
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,740
have to make sure that the policies that

245
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,380
you have can be applied to all the

246
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,060
entities in the group otherwise you have

247
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,740
to you're going to have to kind of work

248
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,260
a lot more to maintain

249
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,880
policies for more entities

250
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,019
I've had this conversation a million

251
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,120
times many people don't believe in doing

252
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,440
something because there's a chance that

253
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
it's not going to work

254
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm sure you've seen it I'm sure I'm

255
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,660
sure you've thought about it and you've

256
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,980
been discouraged about doing something

257
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,540
because there's a chance that you know

258
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,680
people will not adopt it that's not true

259
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,720
as it turns out the most important part

260
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,339
is this communication part so don't

261
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,260
focus on trying to enforce the policies

262
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,380
trust me if you if you communicate them

263
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,060
properly

264
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,380
enforcing them is going to be easy

265
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,060
because once you communicate a policy

266
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,019
like I don't know no more SSH or normal

267
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,959
password password-based SSH let's see

268
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,399
okay

269
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,500
I'm sure that none of you use passwords

270
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,380
for SSH but just in case

271
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,760
so

272
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,540
um

273
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,580
you communicate that and then you're

274
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,800
gonna have like 60 adoption rate on that

275
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,540
policy and then what you're going to do

276
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,160
is you're going to use the red team to

277
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,160
hunt down the Heretics that do not

278
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,060
follow the policy it's as simple as that

279
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,000
tickets in whatever ticketing system hey

280
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,880
you're done screwed up you didn't read

281
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,980
that do it or give me a deadline when

282
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,180
you're going to do it

283
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,399
so do not focus on enforcing the policy

284
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,320
it's it's a useless effort and it's

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
going to demoralize a lot of people and

286
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,459
yourself focusing focused on making sure

287
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,260
that everybody knows about it

288
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,240
on getting challenges on it and getting

289
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,680
people to challenge you I don't want to

290
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,360
do it or something like that

291
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,880
do those debates and then you're gonna

292
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,459
have a at least 60 70 adoption rate and

293
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,079
people following that policy and

294
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,099
respecting that policy

295
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,320
again Rita Green Team any change that

296
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,940
you may make in the lifestyle of

297
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,740
developers users whatever has to be

298
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,380
communicated to at least one month in

299
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,880
advance

300
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,579
I have been in the awkward situation and

301
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm sure most of you have within your

302
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,079
organizations to see new changes on your

303
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,760
computers on your networks and not

304
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,320
knowing about them is the most

305
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,320
frustrating thing ever as I'm sure you

306
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,519
know

307
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,399
so it's a simple thing make sure that

308
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,899
you communicate one month in advance for

309
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,480
any changes that you make

310
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,660
host webinars ask me anything I'm doing

311
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,760
a few times a year I'm doing an armor

312
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,459
with the whole group so we gather

313
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,220
questions on slido and then we address

314
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,380
them to interact with the people this

315
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,720
interaction is very important

316
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,540
and last but by no means list keep a

317
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,820
public page on again Wiki notion

318
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,279
Confluence whatever with all your plans

319
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,800
so right now we're doing pen testing on

320
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
those assets and right now we're getting

321
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,920
a GRC platform we are enforcing you know

322
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,860
Buffs everywhere and cdns and whatever

323
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,060
else

324
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,940
so this public page will help the

325
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,160
engineers the new the newly on boarded

326
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,680
people all your other appeals all the

327
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,240
people that you need in order to achieve

328
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,279
your goals this public page will enable

329
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,079
them to know what we are doing and keep

330
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,640
it updated obviously at all times

331
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,660
so

332
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,399
always have updated policies and

333
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,320
playbooks so every entity in the group

334
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,800
knows what's expected of them

335
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,779
because otherwise they're going we're

336
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,000
going to say okay I want you to enable

337
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,220
you know whatever cloudflare firstly

338
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,660
what you want to be enabled on your

339
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,579
front internet assets and they're going

340
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,680
to say where's the Playbook where does

341
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,839
it say that I need to do that

342
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,240
so that's the objective of the Green

343
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,920
Team internal communication and making

344
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,959
sure that people know what you're what's

345
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,180
expected of them

346
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,040
now

347
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,500
another element to keep your sanity and

348
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,959
this is one of the controversial one

349
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,360
everybody talks about Cloud first but

350
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,660
the scale of cloud first that we want to

351
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,320
do is more than you know most of the

352
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,940
people that I've talked to

353
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,899
everything should be externalized to

354
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,700
trusted providers

355
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,740
so

356
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,380
an example eliminate the local active

357
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,779
directory eliminate anything that's on

358
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,899
premise as much as possible I'm actually

359
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,940
working with it to draft a policy to

360
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,320
kill any

361
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,200
ports any file and print settings VNC

362
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,899
RDP all of these things

363
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,060
and you're going to get pushback on that

364
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,040
because people are going to say yeah but

365
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,839
I need that RDP

366
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,639
to do whatever replace it with

367
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,459
TeamViewer I need to do some to access

368
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,980
the printer okay cloud printing so

369
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,600
you're gonna get I need I have some

370
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,399
dependencies internally that work with

371
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,740
ldap and the block collected directory

372
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,180
okay change it with something that's

373
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,779
adapts to 2022 it's 2022 we shouldn't

374
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,000
have local networks and active directory

375
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,959
anymore

376
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,820
out of curiosity

377
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,980
how many people agree with this

378
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,680
particular topic so no active directory

379
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,139
on premise

380
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,040
come on

381
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,139
it's it's just a kind of I mean we're a

382
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,779
security conference do we not know how

383
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,420
many in how many ways active directory

384
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,160
can be exploited

385
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,459
from all the tickets Kerberos things

386
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,899
it's like

387
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,060
a troll for any any hacker

388
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,880
because from Identity provider and we're

389
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,040
going to talk about SSO

390
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,079
essentially

391
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,699
one of the bigger problems that you

392
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,160
notice is Shadow ID Shadow ID for those

393
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,720
of you who just opened the television is

394
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,180
that moment when somebody opens their

395
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,100
own service within the organization and

396
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,019
it's not sanctioned it's not controlled

397
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,940
nobody knows what what's happening with

398
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,380
that service so

399
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,060
it has its own password maybe a

400
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,360
phpmyadmin why not you know because it's

401
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,040
still a thing in 2022. so

402
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,600
SSO everywhere and a strong identity

403
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,519
provider enables you to have one point

404
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,699
of control for all employees you can

405
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,339
fire them there you can onboard them

406
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,260
there you can set rules to say which

407
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,240
assets they're allowed to access and

408
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,100
last but by no means list you're

409
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,399
mitigating shitty passwords because you

410
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,139
have only one place where they

411
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,120
authenticate only once in the identity

412
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,100
provider and then they're authenticated

413
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,260
for everything in the organization

414
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,440
maybe you have what

415
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,940
vsphere or maybe you have Jenkins or

416
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,579
maybe you have whatever other

417
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:52,500
elasticsearch kibana all the stuff that

418
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,160
you have should be SSO enabled so users

419
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,480
don't have to have like separate

420
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,399
passwords for on a business application

421
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,920
they should only log on once into

422
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,199
identity provider can be Google OCTA

423
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,060
Azure whatever you want

424
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,920
and then don't authenticate everywhere

425
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,740
otherwise I guarantee you some user will

426
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,839
have shitty passwords and they will get

427
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,880
hacked with credential stuff in the

428
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,240
backs

429
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,120
Outsource as much as possible

430
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,240
again a tough build to swallow

431
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,800
companies

432
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,959
especially in Romania

433
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,440
like DIY they want to build stuff

434
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,220
themselves because it's cheaper

435
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,860
but I'm gonna actually have a slight

436
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,680
dedicated just for this it's not cheaper

437
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,720
it sounds cheaper because it's like

438
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
operational costs only but it's

439
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,839
definitely not cheaper I'm going to

440
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,720
touch on it on the next slide

441
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,940
I mentioned earlier eliminate the need

442
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,940
for any kind of endpoint dependencies so

443
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,440
interconnectivity on the local network

444
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,660
should be non-existent I know people

445
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,339
tell you this in all the all the

446
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:00,480
presentations and all the security

447
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,519
conferences they tell you oh my god zero

448
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,980
trust and no more private Network Cloud

449
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,439
first Cloud only I'm saying it again

450
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,079
it's so important because the local

451
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,179
network gives you and again I know it's

452
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,839
a cliche a false sense of security

453
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,599
and that's definitely wrong because The

454
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,140
Insider threat is not uh it's real

455
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,740
Twitter I mean I I'm thankful I'm sorry

456
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,540
for Twitter but I'm thankful that they

457
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,120
got hacked because it's a story that I

458
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,979
can use now to kill the local network

459
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,840
and this is a politics thing

460
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,559
um

461
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,020
in most of my life I've faced the

462
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,360
challenge of talking to people and they

463
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,620
telling me we're gonna do it like this

464
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,260
because this is how what we can do these

465
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,640
are the current capabilities of the

466
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,660
organization these are the current

467
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,419
capabilities of our engineering team and

468
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,559
we're going to do it like this because

469
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,380
we cannot do it any other way

470
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,600
but as it turns out if you challenge

471
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,660
that and brainstorming about finding a

472
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,580
new way of doing things you're going to

473
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,520
be successful and people are just

474
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,580
how should I put it demoralized and they

475
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,380
don't want to do it because they feel

476
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,660
that you know we know that it cannot be

477
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,740
done

478
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,840
my advice to you is do not get

479
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,840
demoralized fight the good fight and try

480
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
to find creative way to overcome and get

481
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,380
again

482
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,220
and get to the year 2022 where you can

483
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,600
do things the way they should be done

484
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,059
not the way they can be done and I

485
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,620
promise you that if you challenge the

486
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,240
peers that tell you that it cannot be

487
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
done you're going to find a way to do it

488
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,179
if anything you can relate to standards

489
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,919
to call the standards worldwide there's

490
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,720
definitely a company that does it right

491
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,460
you can follow their example I'm doing

492
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,640
it I'm not a creative person well a

493
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,980
little bit but whenever I'm kind of

494
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,320
puzzled about something I look okay how

495
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,720
does Adobe do it or how does Facebook do

496
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,340
it or how does Google do it or how does

497
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,440
another company do it they may not do

498
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,059
everything right but at least one

499
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,440
particular aspect is something that an

500
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,480
example that I can follow

501
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,340
in my small world if you have to think

502
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,780
you're doing it wrong okay and if you

503
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,880
are limited by what can be done you're

504
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,820
also doing it wrong there's a way to do

505
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,679
things that's a standard and it works

506
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,780
and it should be adopted and you should

507
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,179
make the case for doing it right not

508
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,679
just enough

509
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,360
because otherwise obviously you're going

510
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,220
to get into a lot of debt and you're

511
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,380
gonna not gonna be able to scale with

512
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,580
the company or you're not going to be

513
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,080
able to support the company in scaling

514
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:39,120
and as I was saying DIY

515
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,760
DIY is just arrogance in believing that

516
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,760
you can do something right again I know

517
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,980
it sounds controversial I don't mean to

518
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,419
offend anybody

519
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,020
but this is the truth your version one

520
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,380
will never be on par with the with an

521
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,419
off-the-shelf solution

522
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,460
and then you have productivity cost

523
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,860
because it's going to be well not as

524
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,700
great

525
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,179
as the golden standard in the industry

526
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,919
you're going to have maintenance costs

527
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,299
because it's going to have a lot of bugs

528
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,500
you're going to have to allocate people

529
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,179
to fix them you're going to have

530
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,640
security costs because it's going to be

531
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,860
some PHP crap that somebody thought it

532
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,580
was a good idea

533
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,740
I know that some I know for a fact that

534
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,900
many of you relate to this okay

535
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,880
and uh

536
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,640
last but by no means list people love

537
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,679
expensive stuff people love efficient

538
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,799
tools if you have your expenses done in

539
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,039
Excel or some again some stuff that some

540
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,840
developers build in-house for doing

541
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,039
expenses versus expensify what I do I

542
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,620
don't know what else

543
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,480
people are going to love saying oh my

544
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,100
God you have like that shitty

545
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,799
application or Excel we have what I do

546
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,020
or we have expensified and and people

547
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,220
are going to love working for your

548
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,299
company because they're going to see

549
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,640
that other companies don't have such

550
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,000
efficient processes as they do so it

551
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,380
actually having an off-the-shelf

552
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,360
unexpensive initially expensive solution

553
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,419
will help employee retention

554
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,160
we'll have a lower total cost of

555
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,840
ownership

556
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,640
will have a lower maintenance cost and

557
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,380
lower risk to the business so even

558
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,520
though you have to pay a hundred

559
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,559
thousand now

560
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,120
you're going to have lower cost in the

561
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,620
long run in two three years because if

562
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,419
you do it internally you're going to

563
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,100
have a much bigger cost when you get

564
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,500
hacked when people are gonna hate it

565
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,140
we're gonna have to allocate additional

566
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,120
time to put some additional sensors or

567
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,559
firewalls in front of it because it

568
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,880
sucks

569
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,659
so again unpopular opinion but I'm a

570
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,460
firm believer that if it's not your core

571
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,460
IP you should not develop it business

572
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,640
apps in-house develop is wrong it's pure

573
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,780
and simple

574
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,840
many of you will hate this but it's me

575
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,399
here telling my my opinion

576
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,240
okay take a strategy to stay safe

577
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,640
everyone I've mentioned this earlier

578
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,100
if you have to maintain logins multiple

579
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,440
logins is just putting out files if you

580
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,539
enable SSO everywhere

581
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,940
you're just going to have an easier time

582
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,740
you're going to reduce your time spent

583
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,200
by 50 I guarantee it

584
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,480
has to be enforced many applications

585
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,059
will not support SSO initially your

586
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,919
developers will have to build some

587
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,159
wrapper on top of it some Cognito some

588
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,620
whatever technology that will enable the

589
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,299
interaction between that application and

590
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,700
SSO and eventually if there's no way to

591
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,080
integrate it with SSO kill it and get a

592
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,400
modern one

593
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
again

594
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,919
you're going to say it's tough you're

595
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,299
going to say it's expensive and I'm

596
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,860
going to challenge that by saying if you

597
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,720
make a strong business case you should

598
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,820
be able to secure the budget for it or

599
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,620
kill it for security reasons and risk

600
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,179
another way to stay sane

601
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,340
CDN wife and strict origin everywhere

602
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,860
any internet-facing asset should be

603
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,220
behind CDN WAFF and have strict origin

604
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,600
is there anyone here that doesn't

605
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,700
understand what strict origin means so I

606
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,220
know if I have to explain it

607
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,440
okay good

608
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,559
if you implement these very simple rules

609
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,720
you're going to have definitely an

610
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,580
easier time managing the security of the

611
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,100
organization because if you don't

612
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,960
then you're going to have people brute

613
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,659
forcing stuff credential Staffing DDOS

614
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,820
attacks which happen on a daily basis

615
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,220
all of the good things and bad things

616
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,679
that would be mitigated if you just you

617
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,299
know spend a little effort initially to

618
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,679
have all of these things implemented and

619
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,720
communicated work with the engineers

620
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,760
and then rest

621
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,299
and just as a perk

622
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,659
we're moving towards TLP

623
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,539
there is document classification which

624
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,880
is document classified the internal use

625
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,860
only and in my opinion this is not a

626
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,679
standard at this point the way those

627
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,840
things I've seen presentations at

628
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,720
conferences that said confidential at

629
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,940
the bottom which is like ridiculous I

630
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,700
mean if it's confidential why like a

631
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,960
thousand people are streaming over the

632
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,320
Internet TLP red Amber and green

633
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,419
it's like the simplest way and it's an

634
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,220
actual standard of classifying

635
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,640
communication all right recipient only

636
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,520
Amber recipient and colleagues green

637
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,220
it's public domain

638
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,580
it's standardized it's it's uh it has

639
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,159
references everywhere and it's easy to

640
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,720
implement

641
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,919
this is TLP green

642
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,159
vulnerability management

643
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,260
obviously an important part these are

644
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,539
part of the tools that we're using

645
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,120
uh donating uses as they like to say

646
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,179
what hackers use which would be

647
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:51,000
re-enjoin uh nuclear nuclei and a number

648
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,880
of other tools we got external sources

649
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,440
that monitor our attack surface like

650
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,320
detectify and a number of automated

651
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,419
scanners that constantly

652
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,000
scan all of our assets and then we have

653
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,280
manual pen testing and then we have a

654
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,179
process to do manual explorative pen

655
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,520
testing with our team

656
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,980
um well in this case you need to kind of

657
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,320
have have an SLA with your engineers

658
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,200
time to fix ideally less than 24 hours

659
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,480
for p1s they're gonna hate it but

660
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,460
they're gonna agree to it and so on and

661
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,820
so forth

662
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:29,100
bounty how many people here have bug

663
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,480
Bounty programs in their companies

664
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,100
way too few

665
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,779
way too few

666
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,880
there is no way shape or form in which

667
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,559
your security team is going to be able

668
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,059
to find everything

669
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,919
you will never find everything you will

670
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
never be able to secure everything which

671
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,480
is why hundreds of thousands of

672
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,100
researchers crowdsourced through

673
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,559
background hacker one or even if you run

674
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,020
it on your own website we'll show you

675
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,520
just how little you know about your

676
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,620
infrastructure the fundamental

677
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,120
definition of a blind spot is that you

678
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,460
don't know about it and trust me we all

679
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,580
have a ton of blind spots

680
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,559
there is no way to quantify how many we

681
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,779
have until there's bug Bounty programs

682
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:10,740
that tell us and there's like

683
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,200
researchers that show us okay so here's

684
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,460
a thought here's the thing that you

685
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,340
didn't know and trust me you're going to

686
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,200
be so thankful when you start

687
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,880
interacting with those researchers

688
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,539
also about keeping sane many people ask

689
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,100
about bring your own device

690
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,559
is the simplest of things you set up a

691
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,500
policy in which you say if a device have

692
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,940
has

693
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,000
the stack of technologies that we need

694
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,880
MDM like InTune jump whatever

695
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,700
um EDR solution and the sanity checks on

696
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,559
the device they're welcome to access the

697
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,539
company resource if they don't they

698
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:52,380
don't

699
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,880
it's as simple as that it's a simple

700
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,360
policy and again communicate it properly

701
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,320
you have no need to worry about 4 4500

702
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,940
endpoints anymore

703
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,620
you implement something that we call

704
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,179
conditional access

705
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,240
and you make available the resources if

706
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,220
you want to install them yourself here's

707
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,320
the kits install them on any device that

708
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,159
you want

709
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,620
and then you can access resources it can

710
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,840
do it for you you can do it for you and

711
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,059
me as a security manager I don't have to

712
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,980
care about it anymore and there you go

713
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
problem solved about endpoint security

714
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,520
and a ton of employees

715
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,320
it's a little bit awkward to implement

716
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,179
but because people are going to resist

717
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,559
it

718
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,480
and they're gonna say I don't want to

719
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,000
install your security tools on my laptop

720
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,460
but that's one of the areas where you

721
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,740
have to make a stand and say in that

722
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,299
case I cannot allow you to access

723
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:48,120
company resources on a computer that's

724
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,340
potentially compromised

725
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,659
if you're subscribed to dark web

726
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:56,400
notifications you can see how many

727
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,340
password Stealers and information from

728
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,380
password Stealers are published there on

729
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,840
a daily basis like hundreds of thousands

730
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,900
of computers harvested their Chrome

731
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,700
passwords or whatever steam passwords

732
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,860
harvested corporate passwords harvested

733
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,860
installed on the dark web and this is

734
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,779
your argument I cannot allow you to

735
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,460
access company resources from a computer

736
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,980
that can be infected with passport

737
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,020
Stealers it's as simple as that

738
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,940
published the policy published the links

739
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,200
to the tools this is how you install

740
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,840
them tutorials and then bam you don't

741
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,980
have to care about endpoint security

742
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,400
anymore

743
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,620
for the blue

744
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,080
sensor sensor sensors everywhere you

745
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,860
cannot

746
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,919
protect what you cannot see

747
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,140
at this point what you should ask

748
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,580
yourself if there's somebody in my

749
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,260
infrastructure if there's somebody brute

750
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,760
forcing an endpoint if there's somebody

751
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,059
trying to do I don't know a need or an

752
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,840
lfi on SQL injection one of my internet

753
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,940
facing assets or one of my assets what I

754
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,260
know about it

755
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,539
and prioritize the low hanging

756
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:01,620
enthusiases that you know are

757
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,140
compromised or and make sure that

758
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,640
you have visibility everywhere and one

759
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,640
exercise is to ensure

760
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,620
that everything is logged and you have

761
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,059
visibility in your splunks or whatever

762
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,880
CM you want to use and by no means least

763
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,500
make sure that you are ready for

764
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,179
forensics and incident response that

765
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,279
means logs everywhere

766
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,140
maybe an endpoint of your gets hacked

767
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,419
maybe you're lucky and gets hacked by

768
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:27,480
your red team and you go to see you want

769
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,980
to see if anybody else exploited that

770
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,020
vulnerability maybe it was a trivial to

771
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,880
exploit vulnerability

772
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,620
and then you wake up that you only have

773
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,720
30 days worth of Vlogs and the

774
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,779
vulnerability was there for seven years

775
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,760
can you guarantee that nobody else

776
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,440
exploited it no

777
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,600
so make sure that you log

778
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,340
everything in a central place you can

779
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,779
use S3 buckets

780
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,480
and make sure that you are able to do

781
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,880
forensics an easy debt response if you

782
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,179
need to

783
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,760
the most lovely part of my job

784
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,059
Legacy

785
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,799
the amount of times I've heard

786
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:11,940
for history reasons or Legacy

787
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,100
it's pretty much the amount of time Elon

788
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,659
Musk has heard about Donald Trump coming

789
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,760
back to Twitter I think it's a fair

790
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,559
assessment

791
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:20,940
it's

792
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,159
it's you have to live with it there's no

793
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,320
way to escape it Legacy is there is it's

794
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,100
easier to stay

795
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,659
your approach to that is going to be ask

796
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,340
for a roadmap because everybody is going

797
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,779
to tell you yeah we're moving everything

798
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,600
to Amazon and we're doing something some

799
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,360
new architecture and it's awesome uh as

800
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,700
for a roadmap and keep following that

801
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,500
roadmap that's going to be one of the

802
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,000
efforts that you're going to have to do

803
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,399
some project management with or at least

804
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,320
have somebody do it you know

805
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,240
as for a clear roadmap of that phasing

806
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,100
dot it can be two months it can be two

807
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,520
years and then isolate those services

808
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,320
because they they are the risk to the

809
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,299
service to to the organization make sure

810
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,820
that if they get hacked the attacker

811
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,620
will not be able to Pivot

812
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,100
and then put everything on it what even

813
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,380
EDR solution even antivirus I don't care

814
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,240
even if it's Linux put some antivirus

815
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,460
EDR put all the stuff anything that you

816
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,559
can put on it to make sure that if it

817
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,080
gets hacked at some point you will see

818
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,240
that moment coming

819
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,159
foreign

820
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,020
and of course once you do that you're

821
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,659
gonna have to keep a list on shitty

822
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,220
things that you're gonna have to keep a

823
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,880
closer eye on

824
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,679
and of course this brings us to there is

825
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,320
no such thing as secured by Design

826
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,880
whenever I hear this time

827
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,559
I say that it's

828
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,899
it's a stupid thing to consider sorry if

829
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,820
I'm offending anybody

830
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,200
I mean there's no such thing as security

831
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,600
is secure by Design because things get

832
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,340
hacked every day although secured by

833
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,080
Design things get hacked every day and

834
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,340
there's like new creative ways to hack

835
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,899
stuff

836
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,940
but if you think about it as compromised

837
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,159
by Design then you have a new outlook of

838
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,779
things and this is in my opinion the

839
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,960
definition of zero trust so

840
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,539
cancel

841
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,419
so people with Cisco at RSA said that

842
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,580
zero trust is VPN

843
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,520
mind-blowing now zero trust is believing

844
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,080
that things are compromised by Design

845
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,080
This is zero trust if one employee would

846
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,299
do something stupid would you see it

847
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:23,399
so treat each asset including people as

848
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,100
if it was already compromised and try to

849
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,559
kind of tailor all the actions and all

850
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,179
the tools and all the Technologies to be

851
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,100
able to pick up on the moment when a

852
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,100
compromised asset does something

853
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,960
and with this mindset of course Taylor

854
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,940
least privilege access it's also going

855
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,140
to be a challenging thing to do because

856
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,779
you might see that in some engineering

857
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,000
units people do not do this

858
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,039
you're gonna have to work a little bit

859
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,360
on this to make sure that you review

860
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,100
their policies you review the way they

861
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,320
access systems and with them together

862
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,299
tailor list privilege access nobody

863
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,860
should have access to more than they

864
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,020
need to have access to so in case they

865
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,880
get compromised they cause the least

866
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,940
possible damage because again people

867
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,039
don't believe it's 20 20 when people

868
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,899
don't believe that they will get hacked

869
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,419
you will get hacked some of your

870
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,220
computers some of your employees some of

871
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,399
your colleagues maybe you will get

872
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,740
hacked

873
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,240
constantly round table tops and

874
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,000
simulations have your blue team run what

875
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,460
if scenarios with Leaders with Engineers

876
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,440
if this would happen how would we handle

877
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,100
it

878
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,380
you should do it at least

879
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,620
I don't know three times a year ideally

880
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,260
you should do it once a month once every

881
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,500
two months table tops

882
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,779
and of course run purple team exercises

883
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:41,700
have your red team

884
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,340
play as usual the bad guy the Rogue

885
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,260
attacker without notifying anybody

886
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,899
playing bad jokes

887
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,419
and then try to see if your blue team

888
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,419
spots them and if they don't then you

889
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:55,620
know you have something to do and you

890
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,880
have something to fix

891
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,279
it's a simple thing to communicate and

892
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,080
it's an easy it's a difficult thing to

893
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,059
kind of implement but it's an important

894
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,640
thing to do because if your rating can

895
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,500
interact with the system and mess around

896
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,179
with it and maybe hack it and your

897
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,619
Bluetooth doesn't see that particular

898
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,379
event then you know you have a problem

899
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,239
and I don't know how many of you do this

900
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,859
but if you don't you should start doing

901
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:20,099
it or your teams should start doing it

902
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,540
phishing exercise is pretty much

903
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,879
straightforward we we run a number of

904
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,520
campaigns in in the group they were

905
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,918
really really evil and of course we had

906
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,560
more engagement in and more conversion

907
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,879
in our fishing campaigns than our

908
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,399
marketing team has on their marketing

909
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,418
campaigns

910
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,940
and as I was saying be brutal do not be

911
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,980
afraid to be brutal because hackers will

912
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,619
be brutal threat actors will be brutal

913
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,899
and you should emulate threat actors

914
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,899
okay

915
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,719
there will always be a way to bypass

916
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,099
anything that you that you've put in

917
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,080
place in terms of defenses do not forget

918
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,119
that and running as many of these

919
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,820
exercises possible will build up your

920
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,339
resilience resilience is not that done

921
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,980
by tooling resilience is not gained by

922
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,859
antivirus cdrs and wafts resilience is

923
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,579
gained by conflict constant conflict

924
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,320
it's the only short way to build

925
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,420
resilience

926
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,060
so this is pretty much it I think that

927
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,040
I'm out of time or

928
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,040
I want to leave it wait wait wait wait

929
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,160
wait

930
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,820
I mean the one takeaway from this

931
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,619
is

932
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,020
build stuff that's abstract and works

933
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,200
for everybody number one communicate as

934
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,240
much as possible if you have the

935
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,099
processes available for everybody and

936
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,300
you communicate them internally people

937
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,820
know what to do then you're gonna have

938
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,320
less stuff to do because you don't need

939
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,240
to do it for them

940
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,118
and um okay now you can clap

941
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,119
thank you very much Jay we still have

942
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,780
five minutes for questions so uh maybe a

943
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,680
question up here at front

944
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,740
hey Jay

945
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,500
hey guys

946
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,000
look yeah

947
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,460
I have two questions

948
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,720
um one is related to uh adopting cloud

949
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,000
well services and applications that's

950
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,980
what the slide was mostly focused on

951
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,040
right are you and also on an advocate

952
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,980
for sassy which is service access secure

953
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,339
Edge uh which is also moving networking

954
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,859
controls networking itself through

955
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:49,800
sd-wan and networker controls as well as

956
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,859
security controls and all the all the

957
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,760
past security things that Appliance

958
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,020
appliances or boxes used to do the

959
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,020
firewall all those things uh those are

960
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,880
now moved in the cloud like cloudflare

961
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,380
one there's other vendors out there

962
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,700
building such Solutions where

963
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,740
everything's in the cloud not just the

964
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,960
applications

965
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,700
I think we can take this offline because

966
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,140
there's too much noise

967
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,599
okay yeah

968
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,359
uh do we have any other questions yep

969
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,359
just one quick question here okay uh so

970
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,700
you suggested that we check how other

971
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,280
companies approach their security

972
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,920
but how do you do this considering that

973
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,380
many companies are quite secretive about

974
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,599
how they approach security that's an

975
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,800
excellent question they shouldn't be

976
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,720
secretive about it we just did a

977
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,079
presentation about it and get some

978
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,700
friends in the other companies or you

979
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,598
know get my business card

980
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,320
so the third takeaway from this talk is

981
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,339
get Jay's business card
