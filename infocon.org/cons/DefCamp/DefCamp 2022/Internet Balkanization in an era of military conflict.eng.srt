13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,520
my name is Dan

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,420
I work for this um startup Boutique

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,180
company you might heard about it

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,100
I am missing my okay I can find here I

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,800
am part of great which is um

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,260
called Global Research and Analysis team

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,739
this team was founded in 2008 within

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,260
Kaspersky we are actually focusing on

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,320
things that are not like usual we are

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,719
focusing on highly Advanced threat

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,180
intelligence highly Advanced apt attacks

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,600
and um you might have heard some of the

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,540
things that my team has been publishing

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,720
throughout those more than 10 plus years

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,420
but you know the past is the past let's

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,360
look at the present and in currently in

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,520
the present we are actually monitoring

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,740
we've been monitoring in the past like

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,520
um two years now more than 900 Opera 900

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,520
operations and groups like apt APD

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,500
campaigns we're not talking about like

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,799
uh some off-the-shelf uh Steelers or

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,299
like keyloggers

36
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,380
et cetera et cetera now we're talking

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,200
about like mature campaigns 900 of them

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,560
20 of them are actually commercial and

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,420
this is pretty interesting

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,119
so if we want to talk about just to give

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,479
you a little overview of what we see and

42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,460
um what is what kind of things that we

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,040
are doing we are researching apt attacks

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,259
and based on our knowledge based on our

45
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,540
research based on our Telemetry we see

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,640
that

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,000
the most targeted the most targeted um

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,340
like Industries or targets are like

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,379
governments diplomatic and

50
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,840
Telecommunications and Military and this

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,360
is pretty interesting because this is

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,879
what I'm going to talk about today

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,980
um it's not going to be a talk about apt

54
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,099
attacks you can find that in our threat

55
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,080
landscape in our threat predictions that

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,040
we are doing

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,080
um this this quarter but today we're

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,400
going to talk about something else

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,220
something which in my opinion is more

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,280
worrying and I think it deserves to be

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,020
discussed we don't want to talk about

62
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,420
balkanization and when we are talking

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,060
about balkanization let me put my

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,000
time machine right here that's good when

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
we are talking about balkanization we

66
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,239
have to actually Define what is

67
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,040
balkanization

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,840
so you know

69
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,459
um historically

70
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,819
and where the term comes from there was

71
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,459
a time where countries or Europe was

72
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,860
kind of fragmented

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,560
and in this fragmentation it is like um

74
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,540
big big changes we've seen a lot of

75
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,420
states which were like um created a lot

76
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,940
of States we were like separated Romania

77
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,519
was also part of this balkanization

78
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,280
and the definition of a balkanization is

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,800
splitting a larger area splitting a

80
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,560
larger State into smaller parts and you

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,680
can see here like in Yugoslavia which

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,319
was as we know in our in our history

83
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,900
this is where this is when I was after I

84
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,739
was born so um this is quite recent

85
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:42,180
Yugoslavia was uh was it's a it's a good

86
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,860
example

87
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,500
this is what volcanization splitting a

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,080
larger chunk into smaller parts but then

89
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,580
the question is what is internet

90
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,940
volcanization well some people call it

91
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,640
Splinter net I'm kind of old school and

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,140
I like to call it balkanization but

93
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,760
nowadays cool kids are calling it

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,760
splinternet and the idea is the same

95
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,239
thus um this principle is the same you

96
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,940
take the parts of the internet which was

97
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,840
created actually it was meant to be a

98
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,299
global

99
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,060
distributed on one internet where

100
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,160
everybody could access it you could

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,500
access like any web server from any part

102
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,600
of the world well now it's not the case

103
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,560
anymore

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,979
and we have current examples we have

105
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,560
current examples of China we have

106
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,259
current examples of India North Korea

107
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,259
Iran and I would like to point out Iran

108
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,780
because it's actually quite sad what is

109
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,220
happening back there with all the

110
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,620
protests and then immediately when the

111
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,960
protests started what did they do they

112
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,560
shot shot down the internet because

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,419
governments understand that the internet

114
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,180
is a super powerful tool I was actually

115
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,340
debating with a good friend of mine when

116
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,320
I was creating this presentation and we

117
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,320
he said that you know

118
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,360
um back in the days you had newspapers

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,820
but then think about it let's let's take

120
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,520
an example of communist Romania

121
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,220
in in in communist Romania you had

122
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,979
newspapers here you had skunta but that

123
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,320
newspaper physically had to get to like

124
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
each each person to the population it

125
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,020
was pretty hard to actually bring

126
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,080
um outside the newspaper or like kind of

127
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,600
people would say propaganda it was quite

128
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,699
hard to have a newspaper from U.S

129
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,220
brought into into Romania in the 80s in

130
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,620
the 70s it wasn't impossible but it was

131
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,919
quite hard so the state was able whoever

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,479
was in control was able to actually

133
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,840
control the flow of information but with

134
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,340
the internet

135
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,400
the things changed actually I would say

136
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,039
the the turning point was actually the

137
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,100
radio and you might remember

138
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,639
um Radio free Europe and then citizens

139
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,979
of Romania

140
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,259
listening kind of hiding the fact that

141
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,820
they were listening to radio free Europe

142
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,560
but it was there the government couldn't

143
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,660
completely block the radio signals that

144
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,580
were coming to Romania but what about

145
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,740
the internet well this is what they're

146
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,660
trying to do they're trying to block and

147
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,280
you know I'm not going to go into into

148
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,160
what's like how and methods how how to

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,440
how to do this kind of blocking but you

150
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,960
know great great firewall of China it's

151
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,940
it's there

152
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,520
um in Russia also I would say it's kind

153
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,160
of a great fire but not as strict as in

154
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,919
in China Iran you know completely

155
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:36,720
disconnected and you know let's let's

156
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,100
see some examples

157
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,720
you know 10 cent

158
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,500
it's uh the largest Chinese or Telecom

159
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,419
company they have everything they're

160
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,539
like this like huge company and it

161
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,759
something that struck me I'm actually a

162
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,100
DOTA player so shout out to DOTA players

163
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,539
here yes

164
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,080
I'm very bad DOTA player so

165
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,880
um but you know I was actually watching

166
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,660
the

167
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,000
um the international competition once a

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,160
year they have like this huge huge event

169
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,560
huge competition the international and

170
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,080
once it was in China but it was pretty

171
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,919
interesting because they weren't the

172
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,180
organizer the main organizer was not

173
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,819
valve actually a company who created um

174
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,940
DOTA sorry who has now Dota 2 but

175
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,099
actually tencent it was under 10 cent

176
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,940
They had to organize it and actually a

177
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,460
lot of events a lot of movies you cannot

178
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,080
publish them you cannot release them in

179
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,840
China unless you go through tencent so

180
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,880
this is one kind of uh one kind of

181
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,599
Separation like one kind of like um

182
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,520
balkanization Russian store

183
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
if you want if you want to download some

184
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,000
Android apps you can download them from

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,639
the Russian store which is not like a

186
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,139
play store kind of like a play store but

187
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,940
it's not a Play Store

188
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,380
also

189
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,500
um anybody heard about this user gate

190
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,520
user gate no I didn't hear about them

191
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,259
apparently it's um next gen vendor

192
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,400
which creates

193
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,340
firewall applications and basically it's

194
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,599
kind of the same you know like you have

195
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,979
Cisco you have 14 in it you have like

196
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,180
Palo Alto they offer the same things but

197
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,580
um with their software and you know

198
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,960
lastly

199
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,780
let's talk about another another example

200
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,340
of kovid kovid vaccines so this is the

201
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,458
soberana this is the Cuban vaccine and

202
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,860
what do you do like maybe they didn't

203
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,320
have access to water now or Pfizer or

204
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,659
AstraZeneca so they said we're gonna

205
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,458
build something we're gonna build it

206
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,740
ourselves so not only they built one

207
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,240
they had they have six different

208
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,060
vaccines and you know is it good is it

209
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,480
bad I don't know but the idea is that

210
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,220
instead of everybody working together

211
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,240
everybody trying to go for the same aim

212
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,120
trying to destroy try to research and

213
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,339
get the best vaccine ever

214
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,040
instead you have this division this

215
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,740
split between between countries where

216
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,360
somebody tries to do their own vaccine

217
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,100
Russians are trying to do their own

218
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,320
vaccine which I don't know if it's good

219
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,600
or bad the Cubans are trying to do their

220
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,000
own vaccine and everybody loses in in my

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
point of view

222
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,660
anyway I want to give you an overview of

223
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,779
the things that happened in our past two

224
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,980
years and you know of course

225
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,580
2022 those are the covidiers and I think

226
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,519
that for sure we are now in the cyber

227
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,100
world years and unfortunately I don't

228
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,740
know this is a question mark because I

229
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,480
don't know when it's gonna end if it's

230
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,820
gonna end so this is pretty you know

231
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,839
like quite sad and it it saddens me the

232
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,940
most to see the world to see the

233
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,920
conflict in Ukraine and I hope it will

234
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,980
end but realistically I don't think it

235
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,200
will end in next year I don't know I

236
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,959
hope I I hope it will

237
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,779
what we've seen as a company what we've

238
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,940
seen based on our research in the cyber

239
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,120
security in the threat landscape and the

240
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,860
previous speakers they also mentioned

241
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,300
some of the attacks that happened in

242
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,959
Ukraine it's aligned with what also the

243
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,240
industry is seeing and you know we have

244
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,680
like the Cyber Tech which have like

245
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,959
black energy one and two which you might

246
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,640
know and like this is pretty pretty

247
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,459
interesting the power grid one industry

248
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,880
attack industry over and not PTM which

249
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,100
is um which was pretty interesting like

250
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,260
it's a wiper which was the div oops

251
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,660
which was developed and delivered using

252
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,700
a supply chain and I think my clicker

253
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,800
broke

254
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
um oh good perfect so we have this like

255
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,519
um so let's go back I can't go back I

256
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,339
can go back sorry so we have this we

257
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,200
have this attacks the Bad Rabbit and

258
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,360
then recently in the active like in the

259
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,040
past like

260
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,260
close to our to our to the present State

261
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,120
we have like gamma Redan and Armageddon

262
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,040
Ops which are pretty interesting you can

263
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,440
read about them they're like um apt

264
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,019
attacks which are gamma Redan Super

265
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,959
Active right now they are like targeting

266
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,880
a lot of a lot of institutions in

267
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,200
Ukraine

268
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
these are like an overview of Apt

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,040
attacks that happened and a special

270
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,980
shout out to Red October which was

271
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,500
discovered in 2013

272
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,019
um it was discovered by my team it it

273
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,480
was there it's not active anymore but it

274
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,519
it's it's pretty interesting because it

275
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,519
was one of the first apt attacks also a

276
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,500
special shout out to you UNC one one

277
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,899
five one ghost writer you might know

278
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:40,980
about it again it it was we've seen it a

279
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,240
little bit we've seen it a little bit

280
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,540
what we also believe that it's a highly

281
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,760
active right now in Ukraine

282
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,320
now

283
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,000
during this war

284
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,180
we've seen an increase of cyber cyber

285
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,540
attacks in Ukraine but not only in the

286
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,880
Ukraine and we've seen that those

287
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,220
attacks those cyber

288
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,680
um let's say cyber operations whatever

289
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,560
you want to call them are actually going

290
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,339
Beyond Ukraine and are going are

291
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:16,100
affecting users from immediate regions

292
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,300
24th of February like a lot of a lot of

293
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,040
modems via sat modems they they went

294
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,380
offline via sat which is the like the

295
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,779
satellite provider they said You know

296
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,060
guys um we lost connectivity and we had

297
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,760
like a lot of bricks a lot of modems it

298
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,860
turns out were bricked so how did this

299
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,200
happen well basically

300
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,480
from what you've seen right now an

301
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,540
attacker which we believe it's hates APD

302
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,220
which is like a russian-speaking APT

303
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,040
group The hates guys they infiltrated

304
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,380
the vsat network they managed to get

305
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,300
access to the management Network they

306
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,339
went there and then they uploaded an

307
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,560
update a former update basically the

308
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,779
firmware update was a script that said

309
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,240
delete all your former file delete all

310
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,980
your boot files or your firmware files

311
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,000
so the the the modems were actually

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,380
booting and they had no files to boot

313
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,660
from there was no Linux kernel so they

314
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,180
were kind of bricked but the idea is

315
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,579
that a lot of terminals in Europe and

316
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,680
power plants sorry not power plants but

317
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,839
windmills were actually affected because

318
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,820
guess what you need to have connectivity

319
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,920
for those windmills for management and

320
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,380
instead of like getting fiber optic

321
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,540
cables you actually connect a modem a

322
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,579
satellite modem and you do it

323
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,399
so this is one example of an attack that

324
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,139
affected us

325
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,279
and then

326
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,839
we have the geopolitical situation

327
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,120
between Russia and Ukraine and we have

328
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
like connecting military action you have

329
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,519
like cyber offensive cyber offensive

330
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,959
risks that are increasing significantly

331
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,959
significantly for significance

332
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,639
significantly for both countries the

333
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,380
idea is that we have different groups of

334
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,920
attackers maybe mercenaries or like um

335
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,899
pretty pretty established attackers like

336
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,500
apt groups which are taking sides so we

337
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,240
have the quantity team you might have

338
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,279
heard about the continent somewhere the

339
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,740
quantity teams they actively took a

340
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,839
stand Pro Russia they said you know

341
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,899
we're we're with Russia uh whatever you

342
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,000
do we're gonna come after you and then

343
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,740
we have like other groups which are

344
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,779
taking the stand against Russia they are

345
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,120
like um doing some sort of like attacks

346
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,519
there are like a lot of leaks there

347
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,040
there's like basically a lot of things

348
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,360
that are

349
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,339
um that are happening and a lot of

350
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,680
groups that are crashing with each other

351
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,839
and we've seen that the quantity there

352
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,519
are the county leaks which the county

353
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,760
guys got got hacked and the their their

354
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,740
chats were leaked so there was this

355
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,860
entire crazy entire Fiasco stuff so the

356
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,380
question remains like out of all those

357
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,899
attacks out of everything

358
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,380
um are we affected does this cyber War

359
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,920
affects us and the answer is yes so from

360
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,660
what we've seen right now what is

361
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,579
happening it is cyborg where in Ukraine

362
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,740
it's we have like known apt activities

363
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,660
we have hacktivism we have unattributed

364
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,779
apts um we have like DDOS attacks and

365
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,519
you might know might have heard about

366
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,420
those videos attacks and in 2023 things

367
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,060
will not get like better things will not

368
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,000
get um the pace of the attacks will not

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,339
get slower we will have we will be We

370
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,440
believe We will have more disruptions

371
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,480
more collateral damage more Supply

372
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,519
chains attacks more sophisticated

373
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,740
attacks and also it is pretty

374
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,720
interesting and be very careful be very

375
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,839
careful Cloud attacks 2fa bypass into fa

376
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,600
fatigue and when I say to a faith to fa

377
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,180
fatigue I'm talking about I remember

378
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Uber remember Uber attack and remember

379
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,160
how they actually got hacked so now

380
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,100
I like to pause a bit and just think

381
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,820
about what I said and just to

382
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,660
understand that this cyber War which is

383
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,160
happening on the internet which is

384
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,620
happening kind of close to us close to

385
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,860
Romania it's not only affecting them but

386
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,839
it's actually affecting Romania as well

387
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,820
it's affecting EU and actually it's

388
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,860
affecting the entire world

389
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,699
and those attacks are not only targeted

390
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,339
towards specific institutions from those

391
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,579
countries but actually are affecting our

392
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,399
daily lives and this is the my main

393
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,800
point about balkanization and you'll see

394
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,079
some of the I will point out some

395
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,540
examples of how

396
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,120
those attacks are actually affecting you

397
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,339
and how vulcanization is actually bad

398
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,240
for for us so my first example is those

399
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,779
DDOS attacks that happened in I would

400
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,480
say the early days of the war so in

401
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,519
March in April you might have heard

402
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,959
about those attacks you might have heard

403
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,040
about

404
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,620
um like institutions Banks government

405
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,199
like um pro pro NATO Pro U Europe Pro

406
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,880
eprom like Ukraine groups doing DDOS

407
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,160
attacks on Russian Banks and then we

408
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,640
have like um Russian actors doing DDOS

409
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,640
attacks against like uh institutions in

410
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,020
in Europe

411
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,500
those attacks happened and then what

412
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,859
happened is that like in Europe

413
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,919
certain institutions came by and said

414
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,419
hey you know

415
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,400
we need to protect ourselves against

416
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,980
those DDOS attacks so what are we going

417
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,000
to do we're gonna uh we're gonna release

418
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,020
these huge list of didos attackers and

419
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,960
then we are gonna force is internet

420
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,120
service providers to actually block

421
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,000
those IP addresses

422
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,320
so

423
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,440
in this approach might be good or might

424
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,200
be bad but something to understand here

425
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,780
is that those DDOS attacks existed way

426
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,700
before when I was doing my talk about

427
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,940
honeypots the I was like having like

428
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,640
millions of attackers which abusers

429
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,620
which were doing didos attacks to

430
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,260
various honeypots to various entities

431
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,240
which were private entities back then

432
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,039
there wasn't weren't a lot of government

433
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,320
entities and then those attacks were

434
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,460
like pretty

435
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,740
um usual in the industry so there wasn't

436
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,140
anybody or no government agency coming

437
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,960
and saying hey you know we need to we

438
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,539
need to block those attackers at the

439
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,580
country level

440
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,820
because it's stupid like it you don't do

441
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,340
that and then

442
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,700
um what happened in March is that

443
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,559
those attacks happened those did those

444
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,480
attacks happen and then we have certain

445
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,539
institutions which issued those lists

446
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,640
and they said you have to bet you have

447
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,140
to block this you have to block this you

448
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,299
have to block this and then the like

449
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,580
citizens of Europe citizens of like um

450
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,679
those specific countries they couldn't

451
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,960
access those IP addresses anymore

452
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,480
and then what happened because they did

453
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,480
it so fast without any due diligence

454
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,840
without any any proper verification they

455
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,780
started blocking legitimate websites

456
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,640
they started blocking legitimate

457
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,620
businesses and then you have to ask

458
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,620
yourself is this really the way to go is

459
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,100
this really that some agency comes and

460
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,799
says you have to block this stuff this

461
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,600
part of the internet basically they say

462
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,000
this part should not be

463
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,340
um should not be reachable anymore by

464
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,440
the citizens of this country and then

465
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,039
they add this legitimate businesses and

466
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,100
they say oops oh sorry I did a mistake

467
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,140
well the question is why did you do it

468
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,620
in the first place why did you force

469
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,200
those lists because you know Adidas

470
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
attack is Adidas attack you don't have

471
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,400
to block it at the country level you you

472
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,220
have different methods of of protecting

473
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,160
yourself against attacks in those lists

474
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,660
I also seen uh aptc2 servers wow this is

475
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,299
cool but then why because we've been

476
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,220
reporting and the entire industry has

477
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,700
been reporting aptc to some aptc tools

478
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
like in the past 10 years did we see

479
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,640
them in a list that was like mandatory

480
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,740
regulated to be blocked by the entire

481
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,080
countries of Europe no this only

482
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,600
happened because during the war because

483
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,539
they said oh it's it's a matter of

484
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:28,260
um

485
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,820
urgency we need to block everything so

486
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,320
we're just gonna dump a lot of IP

487
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,840
addresses are they good are they bad we

488
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,360
don't know or they might know they have

489
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,860
intelligence they have briefings they

490
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,980
have like um sources of information but

491
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,799
those sources are actually not public we

492
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,419
don't know why did you put that IP

493
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,220
address why did you put that seat server

494
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,620
because somebody told us in the briefing

495
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,059
okay sure

496
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,760
so this is one case then there's another

497
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,559
case so CV 2022-40684

498
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,160
this is a Fortinet zero day

499
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,980
um you know like last month actually

500
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,919
exactly last month to the extent yes so

501
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,600
one month ago

502
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,120
you know those kind of zero days exists

503
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,960
and you know like you can't there's no

504
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,960
nothing to blame but my friend here I

505
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,120
have a friend he he works for a company

506
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,220
and then he has like this medium

507
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,500
medium-sized company and he had these 49

508
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,679
routers and then this um this

509
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,960
vulnerability comes in

510
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,200
five minutes I was told I have ten okay

511
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,360
I'll go fast so this vulnerability comes

512
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,960
in and then in the past he would go to

513
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,820
his Fortinet routers in the browser

514
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,799
history you can see here in his history

515
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,140
he was going to like system for a

516
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,880
firmware upgrade blah blah blah blah

517
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,900
blah blah blah blah you know

518
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,100
Dean he goes there he goes to he goes

519
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,860
one second he goes to like a system

520
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,020
former rugby and the option is not there

521
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,059
anymore and he was like dude what the

522
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,539
 and then when he tries to go there

523
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,460
like um

524
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,460
go to the link system NG and system

525
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,919
former there he's greeting with this

526
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,740
like 403 access denied so basically what

527
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,700
happened the router somehow decided hey

528
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,280
you know you are part of a company which

529
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,659
is not a a grid or I don't know or like

530
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,159
um something happened and the router

531
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,080
said you're not allowed to upgrade my

532
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
firmware anymore

533
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,740
but then there's this zero de

534
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,480
vulnerability with like um basically you

535
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,760
could ask if you could access the admin

536
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,919
page you had access to the router what

537
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,659
do you do you have a vulnerable router

538
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,220
you cannot take it out from your from

539
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,380
your network what are you gonna do

540
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,559
so what did he do he sat with his router

541
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,720
vulnerable router and then he prayed

542
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,280
that the attackers will not attack

543
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,280
exploited vulnerability

544
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,220
so in the end these examples what I

545
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,900
wanted to show you is that

546
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,780
this balkanization actually weakens our

547
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,940
security just because we are putting

548
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,820
fences just because we we are protect we

549
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,559
are saying oh this is your internet this

550
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,900
is my internet actually weakens the

551
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,000
entire security of the whole internet

552
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,580
and I just wanted to show you from all

553
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,860
the all the things that happen the

554
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,780
countries that are listed below we also

555
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,299
have like us and Europe which are also

556
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,940
doing this kind of balkanization and you

557
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,559
have to ask yourself

558
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,140
East is the way to go East is the right

559
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,539
way to do it to just say oh you know

560
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,299
this is bad and this is good I'm not

561
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,059
here it's not my job to say what is good

562
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,340
or what is bad but the internet was not

563
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,080
created to be

564
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,220
separated the internet was created to be

565
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,280
accessible by everybody and if we work

566
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,280
together if we cooperate together

567
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,860
um then we can achieve greater things

568
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,480
kind of think about like what they're

569
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,400
doing in Foundation kind of if you've

570
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,740
seen like if you've read foundation and

571
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,080
then the another problem is that the

572
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,419
what I've seen is that a communication

573
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,200
itself it's kind of in one way so we

574
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,000
have this regulatory body or something

575
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,520
and then they say they push the data

576
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,440
they say you know we've decided this and

577
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,960
we've decided that but instead in my

578
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,919
opinion

579
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,799
it should be a two-way street it should

580
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,980
be like a way where they say they decide

581
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,480
something and then you can come with a

582
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,640
feedback and this is a democratic way of

583
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,720
doing things

584
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,100
you know

585
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,620
I've been talking about problems I've

586
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,299
been talking about issues but I'd like

587
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,400
to give you some solutions like what can

588
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,280
we do what should be done in my opinion

589
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,880
as in in my experience you know humble

590
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,600
experience I'm not like super like a

591
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,980
veteran in this field in the cyber

592
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,659
security field and just trying to make

593
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,120
my way I would think that communities

594
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,360
that are working together are best if we

595
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,080
have like a community which says

596
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,659
to a government body a government agency

597
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,419
or to whoever regulates they say Hey you

598
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,120
know you shouldn't do that you should

599
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,580
actually try to implement this and that

600
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,700
or you've done this thing these lists

601
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,679
those lists are not good

602
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,320
why because this this and that if we

603
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,000
have industry cooperation if you have

604
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,620
like partnership with private companies

605
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,960
this help

606
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,159
um development and they will try to be

607
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,480
improved in a better world we actually

608
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,460
have to try to break the isolation

609
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,120
barriers we have to try to not isolate

610
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,340
ourselves we have to try to work

611
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,200
together and

612
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,900
step aside from politics a bit

613
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,260
you know try not to be implicated try

614
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,320
not to take only one side and say this

615
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,659
is good and this is bad because in the

616
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,960
end the problem is that those in power

617
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,299
they don't have enough competence in my

618
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,179
opinion I'm not saying specifically XYZ

619
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm saying in general and those with

620
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,440
competence they don't have enough power

621
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,140
and only by having a two-way

622
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,380
communication might help us and the

623
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,020
problem is that in the long run

624
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,539
if we don't do that and this is a word

625
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,600
of warning from myself to death camp to

626
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,640
the attendees you here at Dev Camp

627
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,159
people watching online and then for the

628
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,360
future people who will watch the

629
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,299
recording if we don't act now if we

630
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,159
don't think about it and this is why I

631
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,299
want to have this talk to raise

632
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,580
awareness if we don't think about it in

633
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,860
the long run we'll accept more and more

634
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:45,419
in March we accepted those uh lists of

635
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,360
banning basically balkanizing specific

636
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,760
parts of the internet and then what is

637
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,539
going to be next in the name of Security

638
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,980
National Security in the name of

639
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,500
protecting against above against cyber

640
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,720
attacks in the war you know

641
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,419
where is the immediate danger of doing

642
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,980
that things and as I mentioned before

643
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,980
didos attacks existed way before this

644
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,980
war in Ukraine was way before their next

645
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,220
Crimea in 2014 nobody cared nobody

646
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,860
blocked them but nowadays oh we have to

647
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,140
block because it's Adidas attack why

648
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,960
so I would just like to leave you with

649
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,419
some really nice forks really nice NGO

650
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:28,980
they are actually trying to to build a

651
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,659
better future for the Romanian internet

who are trying to start the debate who

657
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,100

you have questions in the audience yes

665
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:10,760
yes we do have questions in the audience

666
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,679
thank you very much it was a great

667
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,419
presentation

668
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,900
um I have a more complicated one and one

669
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,340
remark I'll start with the remark

670
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,220
because it's shorter

671
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,740
sorry thank you regarding the uh the

672
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,840
list of let's say Bentley spend that

673
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,539
because they attacked uh our they did

674
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:34,140
ask our servers some time ago even some

675
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,620
uh Romanian news sites were the Dust for

676
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,279
example G4 media and cloudflare was

677
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,500
their provider as far as I know and they

678
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,779
blocked everyone including me even

679
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,059
though I was not attacking them but I

680
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,020
think they banned the range of ips

681
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,679
unfortunately this meant that I would

682
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,840
not be able to access them and if I

683
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,760
wanted let's say more independent news

684
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,039
it would be a bad thing uh and just to

685
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,220
close this small remark

686
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,840
earlier attacks I think in the Ukraine

687
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,799
as well were started from Romania and

688
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,380
U.S and other countries I think from

689
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,659
vulnerable iot devices

690
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,320
so again blocking them is not really

691
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,960
the best option but to

692
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,520
ask now uh regarding the

693
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
uh the the

694
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,140
I wouldn't really call it separation but

695
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,659
let's call it the Splinter net how would

696
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,520
you consider

697
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,399
um other hidden services like i2p and

698
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,760
Tor because for example let's say uh we

699
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,120
live under our restricted regime I'm not

700
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,799
allowed to use social media but for

701
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,440
example Facebook allows you to access it

702
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,640
via tour

703
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,399
but this is a segregation it's not a

704
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,679
public internet but it helps me let's

705
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,620
say thank you okay so I'm gonna be brief

706
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,840
we can discuss it later on in the short

707
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,059
break I'm sorry you got blocked by

708
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,320
cloudflare

709
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,960
um the idea is the idea is that it's

710
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,120
okay to block the dose attacks and then

711
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,380
um there might be like some sort of

712
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,500
collateral damage but those blocks are

713
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,200
not mandated by a government agency they

714
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,179
are like implemented by the

715
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,059
administrator of the website so it's not

716
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,799
something that is forced upon the

717
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,679
citizens it's actually something that a

718
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,260
website tries to protect itself and we

719
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,760
can discuss a little bit this is the

720
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,140
main difference

721
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,020
um I fully support I acknowledge the

722
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,899
fact that vulcanization exists and

723
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,539
Facebook is blocked in China in Iran et

724
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,580
cetera et cetera we have to live with it

725
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,380
but the question is we don't have to

726
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,320
allow further balkanization this is what

727
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,419
I'm trying to say in my presentation and

728
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:54,179
I fully support I run a tour tour bridge

729
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,460
I run a tour exit node I fully support

730
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,799
those methods because governments are

731
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,840
trying to lock and you have to fight

732
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,299
against this kind of censorship

733
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,000
um I think so yeah thank you Don next

734
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
question hello Dan

735
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,159
nice to see you again and thanks for the

736
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,960
presentation likewise a quick

737
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,240
clarification on the fortnite firmware

738
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,279
update issue was that because of

739
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,940
sanctions like Fortinet was prevented

740
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,179
from supplying services to that IP block

741
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,120
or region or company and then that

742
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,640
included former so the um I can't

743
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,940
comment on the company or on the regions

744
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,720
there weren't any any sanctions but I

745
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,659
can say that this was this is what my

746
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:43,260
friend found on the Fortinet and uh I

747
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,460
don't we don't know exactly what

748
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,659
happened what what made it uh block but

749
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,059
it happened okay because I'm thinking do

750
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,059
you think it has to do with outdated or

751
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,899
existing legal processes and obligations

752
00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:00,240
but outdated guide or guidelines that

753
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,399
are outdated for the internet age for

754
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,140
example we know in the US they have the

755
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,080
sanction mechanism so once an entity is

756
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,080
put on the sanctions list company is are

757
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
prohibited from providing Services which

758
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,820
include server software which firmware

759
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,100
is a former update is software yes yes

760
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,340
to provide to those entities or and when

761
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,059
the the list of entities is is brought

762
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,520
what with a vendor like Fortinet have to

763
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,700
do rather than you know stop every every

764
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,100
service they can they provide to those

765
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,799
companies so they don't risk you know

766
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,440
litigation or uh penalties from the

767
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,100
government

768
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,779
this is a can I would like to answer

769
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,279
this one and I think we can we can

770
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,200
finish this is a very good point and

771
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,240
again I'm not blaming anybody I'm not

772
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,279
blaming Fortinet I'm not saying like oh

773
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,080
you know like this is bad I'm just

774
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,240
stating the facts of what happened there

775
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,340
weren't any sanction in sanctions in

776
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,860
this case but I'm just trying to say

777
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,039
that because of this balkanization and I

778
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,080
don't know what process what

779
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,659
um what was the

780
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:06,419
um logic what was the the mechanism

781
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,720
behind of what led to the blocking of

782
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,580
the firmware I don't know

783
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,700
it may be like XYZ

784
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,100
what I'm trying to say is that I'm not

785
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,500
complaining I'm not blaming the

786
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,720
mechanism it says itself

787
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,320
I'm just raising a warning signal about

788
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,039
the outcome and the outcome was you are

789
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,860
a company you're using a product and out

790
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,220
of the blue they say you cannot update

791
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,860
your device anymore and then there's

792
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,840
like a zero day which kind of

793
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,820
coincidentally happened at the same kind

794
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,799
of the same time What do you do then

795
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:47,220
because in initially you say hey no I

796
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,779
would like to buy 14 because they are

797
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,760
the best I like to buy Palo Alto because

798
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,039
they are the best and then they will say

799
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,799
oh you know up or maybe we would like to

800
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:56,940
block you

801
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,940
but this is not a simple example right I

802
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,640
mean I assume there is a manual update

803
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,500
mechanism that can be triggered from the

804
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,059
command line rather than the interface

805
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,740
there there probably is something like

806
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,080
that but dirty hack yeah that's that's

807
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,300
not the point yeah I get it thanks for

808
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,220
answering thank you very much uh
