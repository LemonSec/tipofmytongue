1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
hello everyone I'm kyogi achalaya from

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,720
Georgetown

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,360
let's briefly introduce myself I'm cyber

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,340
security researcher at kokai's

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,259
University and also I work with

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,599
scientific cyber security Association of

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,859
Georgia

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,680
which is a exclusive representative of

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,039
the beat Sentinel in the region so we

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,260
are teaching the students so penetration

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,359
testing

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,840
um using a cybered platform and making a

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,079
penetration testing in the region in

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,960
Europe and for local companies

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,100
uh also go I'm managing a scientific

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,160
scientific gnss network of Georgia it's

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,280
a navigation system of Georgia

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,980
now we are making local reference

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,160
systems to maximize their location

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,760
offset devices for civil military and

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,660
foreign user cases so actually this was

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,400
a go idea of why today I'm going to talk

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,760
about device tracking but connected to

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,240
the cyber security in our case

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,159
in 5G Network

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,979
uh so go

27
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,659
today I will talk about the device

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,720
tracking streets in 5G Network for end

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,200
users so first of all let's start from

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
the starting point uh during the last

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,119
period the rate of developing mobile

32
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,200
devices has increased so go now you see

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,920
the number of devices and population as

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,960
a graph

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,939
and the yellow ones are the number of

36
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,520
populations and the blue ones are the

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,700
number of devices so per user and in the

38
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,439
world and as you see there are too many

39
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,680
devices which are operating or the

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,780
wireless network

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,860
so the developing these devices

42
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,680
itself triggered to start working on the

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,780
new standards of mobile Communications

44
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,600
because existing

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,038
standards for this region previous one

46
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,760
no was not enough to provide the service

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,520
enough and the high reliable services

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,160
for these devices

49
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,319
so the engineers started working on the

50
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,980
new standards so and as you see as you

51
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,680
know the new standards functionalities

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
devices always comes and there is new

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,319
streets and vulnerabilities in the cyber

54
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,940
security

55
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,379
uh so our study was about uh what's a

56
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,140
new streets related to their go 5G

57
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,720
Network changes uh related to the

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,620
infrastructure and the design so we have

59
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,260
compared the existing streets existing

60
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,239
method of locating devices and try to

61
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,120
test it in 5G Network

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,860
so because this were the three

63
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,160
objectives so how does a 5G architecture

64
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,739
affect on the user equipment location

65
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,280
privacy which band is more vulnerable

66
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,560
and I will explain the idea of this

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,319
question and the last one is to track

68
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,319
device in mobile networks using this

69
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,640
vulnerability

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,519
so go first of all let's see the scope

71
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,480
of the 5G Network and the three kpis is

72
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,920
to go

73
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,379
let you go the bandage more than 10

74
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,379
gigabit per second and as you see the

75
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,440
target market so this uh network is uh

76
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,780
quite big it will start from the end

77
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,360
users and and with the critical services

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,760
like emergency

79
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,500
Healthcare military and so on virtual

80
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,360
reality uh Ai and so on so this scope is

81
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,120
so big and incorporating different

82
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,959
Industries into one huge Network also is

83
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,599
very vulnerable and the security should

84
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,580
be in a high level

85
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,360
uh so the latency of the standards is

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,659
will be up to one millisecond and the

87
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,879
number of devices is also increased and

88
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,180
this is one good point so of the

89
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,760
standards and um

90
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,858
for these reasons there are something

91
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,899
quality changes that should be done to

92
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,040
achieve this uh requirement so from 3gpp

93
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,639
uh in our case the more our interest and

94
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,380
point of interest is the operating

95
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,960
Spectrum the first category will be

96
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,500
lower low band which is uh below one

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,160
gigahertz and this is used in a highly

98
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,440
populated areas because of the

99
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,500
frequencies below one gigahertz is a

100
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,440
list of less affected by the buildings

101
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,419
and building materials and I will

102
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,060
explain this idea a bit later the second

103
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,400
pane will be but the limitation is

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,220
Avengers because it's about up to 100

105
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,220
megabit per second also goes the mid

106
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,100
band it's from one gigahertz to six

107
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,880
gigahertz uh the band Which is higher

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,400
than previous one but it's more affected

109
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,840
by the buildings and the other

110
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,180
objectives

111
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,340
because as we know that as we increase

112
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,440
the frequency frequency it will be more

113
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,300
affected by the buildings and any other

114
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,280
objects

115
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,639
I will explain this idea and what kind

116
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,539
of objectives are

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,180
limiting boundary sense of coverage and

118
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,699
their distance of the network and the

119
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,320
last one is a high band from six

120
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,320
gigahertz to 100 gigahertz actually this

121
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,139
paint promise all the benefits of the 5G

122
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,560
networks and our Target of This research

123
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,979
was this category how it helps us to

124
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,699
locate the device so without knowing two

125
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,699
three or more cell towers our goal was

126
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,580
to try and locate the device only by one

127
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,340
cell tower

128
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,660
locate to determine its location of

129
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,460
theirs

130
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,120
I will explain this idea so the start is

131
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,759
a method of locating devices uh the

132
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,800
concept of determining the location of

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,780
the devices for different methods or

134
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,280
techniques are the same we need the

135
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,280
reference system and we need a research

136
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,340
device generally these systems are GPS

137
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,280
satellites so GPS is a familiar name but

138
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,740
the correct one is a gnss because the

139
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,800
GPS are the satellite from a us they're

140
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,039
also Galileo clonas and so on

141
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,240
and the other type is a agps SSC GPS

142
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,000
which stands for determining our

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,880
locations buying cell towers provided

144
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,580
our Network operators so I mean Telecom

145
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,380
operators

146
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,460
um

147
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,880
so in any case device is trying to

148
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,419
calculate this uh its locations on the

149
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,060
Earth by measuring the signal code by

150
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,880
the satellite from the satellites or go

151
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,280
calculate its locations by the data

152
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,039
cached by the cell towers

153
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,220
so let's uh make it let's compare each

154
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,740
other so the first one was there you go

155
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,020
right one it's a

156
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,860
lot right but left one it's uh gnss also

157
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,500
called GPS and we have the device and

158
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,840
we're tracking the signals so we'll send

159
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,020
it by say go navigation systems uh in

160
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,360
our case by the satellites we are which

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,060
are operating in a lower bit over the

162
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,780
air

163
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,440
so go actually this is a most precise

164
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,699
technique to calculate our location uh

165
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,680
it's uh you can achieve up to one

166
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,680
millimeter per one millimeter for

167
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,800
coordinators but it has some limitations

168
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,319
so because it's our traveling over there

169
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,539
go different layers of theirs like

170
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,819
unisphere so it's affected by the number

171
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,060
of electrons so in the unisphere also

172
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,120
the building preposition and so on and

173
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
the next one is a GPS so when we go get

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
the information from cell towers and

175
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,180
making or printing this articles and

176
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,660
calculating or finding our cross section

177
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,840
and it's our locations now both of them

178
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,300
has some limitations and I will explain

179
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,340
all of them

180
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,639
uh so because you say how in case of a

181
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,919
GPS we are calculating uh device

182
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,958
locations so the first one is to print

183
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,240
the circles and the cross section is our

184
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,419
probable location uh in some countries

185
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,880
it's regulated by the government that uh

186
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,240
Network operators are required to set up

187
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
their cell towers to provide these

188
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,100
coordinators uh lightly look into so

189
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,380
precise that in case of emergency or

190
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,380
military uh the emergency guy should be

191
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,600
able to determine our phone's locations

192
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,779
Network operators also go are trying to

193
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,260
find our locations by by this

194
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,800
information so our cell phone so

195
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,320
always so our running background this

196
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
process to find nearby cell towers and

197
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,420
by default all the cell towers are

198
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,420
sending its ID

199
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,640
which is unique in the network and also

200
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,700
that isn't longitude so if I know their

201
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,000
location and I know possible distance of

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,279
this printing the signal I can determine

203
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,279
my possible location so it's called real

204
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,440
iteration and also the next one is a

205
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,860
triangulation but it's for ideal cases

206
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,080
and it's for

207
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,320
low frequency signal because as there

208
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,540
are building so high frequency signals

209
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,519
will be affected by the building so

210
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
there will be the bias

211
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,940
uh in 5G Network

212
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,880
in the previous networks also the

213
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,800
attached process when our cell phones

214
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,360
are trying to connect to third cell

215
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,640
towers the request is sent to in

216
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,220
unencrypted way it means that if someone

217
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,680
will catch our request or sniff our

218
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,459
request to the cell tower to he or she

219
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,680
will be able to modify some parameters

220
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,380
like modify to disable power saving or

221
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,600
disable the roaming

222
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,399
your cell phone no matter how strong

223
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,980
signal do you have for every time uh

224
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,680
scars the nearby cell towers to find the

225
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,700
strongest one and try to go

226
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,440
micromic 2 switch from Master Tower to

227
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,700
another one in 5G Network and also in 4G

228
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,519
network it's able to make fake base

229
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,300
stations and catchy signals I mean if I

230
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,060
create a fake cell tower so in this room

231
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,420
I will be able to catch your signals

232
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,060
from your phone when your phone tries to

233
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,760
find new cell tower it will measure the

234
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,339
signal strength from my fake Tower and

235
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,660
the Tower of your Telecom operators and

236
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,880
because I'm near to your cell tower and

237
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,339
Signal will be the stronger one your

238
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,560
connection will be your device will be

239
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,220
connected to my tower so go after that I

240
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,140
will be able to sniff your connection or

241
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,360
disable some parameters

242
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,320
uh so it was a problem for generator but

243
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,380
for 5G Network it's crucial because of

244
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,300
the scope of the network and because of

245
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,880
the emergency services

246
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,000
uh when also go

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,519
our devices at the same time is

248
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,240
connected only on one Tower but the

249
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,660
device has a list of nearby Towers uh

250
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,360
visible cell towers so when I'm catching

251
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,700
the information for the record of the

252
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,760
also Towers from your device I'll be

253
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,700
able to calculate your location without

254
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,040
your permission and I will demonstrate

255
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,600
how easy it is in that case on the slide

256
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
you see the real towers and fake ones

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,880
and it's simple that when you have fake

258
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,000
input when I saw your list of the towers

259
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,180
and there are fake inputs so I can I I'm

260
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,660
not able to find your exact locations so

261
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,560
it costs it so gives me ability to

262
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,540
um

263
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,959
make some mistakes and calculate your

264
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,459
relocate your device in case of

265
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,200
emergency

266
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,160
so the first thing when we were trying

267
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,920
to catch the gnss data which is more

268
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,820
precise in the world of how calculating

269
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,640
a horizontal location or horizontal

270
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,940
movement of the device it's not useful

271
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,880
because it's too noisy as it requires a

272
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,700
user permission and user interaction

273
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,820
from our device because

274
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,740
because of the security device always is

275
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,839
printing that someone is catching your

276
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,180
coordinates or trying to still go GPS

277
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,120
coordinates from your device also for

278
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,360
that reason a GPS model or Hardware

279
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,660
should be enabled and switched on on

280
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,660
your device if you disable go for the

281
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,120
security no one will be able to steal

282
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
this information from your phones or any

283
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,060
other devices now also the limitation

284
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,000
here it comes because

285
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,200
uh it requires an open Skype to have a

286
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
good satellite view in this satellite

287
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,700
geometry on the side on the sky should

288
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,880
be the better in other case uh you no

289
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,060
matter you might have the record from 10

290
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,700
or 12 satellites but if the geometry is

291
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,399
a is not a good you will not be able to

292
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,000
locate any device so in that case we go

293
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,380
GPS signal is not enough so also another

294
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,260
limitation of this technique was it a

295
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,320
total electron concentration content on

296
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,440
the unit sphere when the signal is sent

297
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,380
by the satellite so it is affected by

298
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,560
the electrons in the ionosphere so the

299
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,740
Euro location is not so precise

300
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,100
sometimes to use by emergency cases also

301
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,839
when we are in the building we are not

302
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,540
able to locate our phones and in that

303
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,519
case we need

304
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,399
uh we need the information from South

305
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,680
Towers

306
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,380
as I have mentioned cell towers usually

307
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,720
spreads the information about themselves

308
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,980
so by default so it's like

309
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,139
when we have the beacon packet so from

310
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,740
the wireless access points uh by this

311
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,480
access point in sending that so it's

312
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
available for the connection and they're

313
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,399
also go important parameters of the

314
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,440
security like uh if the protection from

315
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,240
the authentication it sounds like this

316
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,019
is enabled or not in our case so towers

317
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,060
are also sending the information about

318
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,980
the ID of the network country code

319
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,440
region code and they are person like

320
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,680
this so as it's said by default we can

321
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,760
go through the streets or walk by the

322
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,160
softwares enabled which will be able to

323
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,320
collect all the cell towers and by say

324
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,699
then by any software like arcgis or

325
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:21,540
arcmic we can plot all these Maps also

326
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,779
we need the digital elevation model also

327
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,680
the country our point of interest and in

328
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,760
this case we can

329
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,740
plot all the satellites and make a

330
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,139
coverage map of the network and then

331
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,079
when I know which satellite which cell

332
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,899
towers are visible to your devices I

333
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,120
will be able to find your exact

334
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,660
locations it works for for these 3G

335
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,000
networks but it's not precise because of

336
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,279
the frequency so it's a low frequency

337
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,699
Network and it's not necessary to be

338
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,699
near to the cell tower to go and catch

339
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:03,060
the signal and to join the network

340
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,639
uh so go

341
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,480
also they go limitation here is it

342
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,980
Telecom operators are trying to cover

343
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,380
and to provide a good service and in the

344
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,420
previous Network generation networks if

345
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,339
there are too many satellites not

346
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,399
satellites but still Towers

347
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,639
sometimes uh their uh

348
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,940
is there a problem to find

349
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,260
sometimes the cross section is too big

350
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,440
to locate the device exactly you might

351
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,220
determine the

352
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,000
street number CT or part of the city but

353
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,620
you not be able to determine the

354
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,180
location with a accuracy of five meters

355
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,579
uh so it's a problem of the previous

356
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,639
networks and why the telecomparators or

357
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,560
security guys need some time to go

358
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
calculate our locations so it's not so

359
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,339
as easy as it seems uh also there are

360
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,380
some studies or researches it's uh the

361
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,720
single strings might be considered

362
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,339
during the calculation of the location

363
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,339
but because of the frequency and

364
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,000
regulations by some countries it's it's

365
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,280
complicated and it's not useful and I

366
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,299
will explain why so

367
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,339
telecomparators and wireless

368
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,619
Technologies are operating on the radio

369
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,799
frequency using by radio frequency which

370
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,040
is a part of electromagnetic waves so go

371
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,559
it's also called RF abbreviation and

372
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,940
it's a

373
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,400
it depends on the ego physics and

374
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,500
everything which happens to the radio

375
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,600
waves also happens to the Telecom

376
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Networks

377
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,340
there are also the technology go

378
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,240
pollution from radio frequencies and

379
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,520
they are trying to make some regulations

380
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,120
and in some in some in some countries

381
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,980
this regulation is already operating

382
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,320
because they are changing the building

383
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,020
materials or specific isolation so that

384
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,299
protects so for example pregnancy humans

385
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,620
or children uh or any other guys with

386
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,720
influence from radio frequencies because

387
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,419
according to the researches and testis

388
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,360
uh medical implants or pregnants and

389
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,580
children should protect itself or

390
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,039
themselves from the uh over

391
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,620
um over number of radio frequencies so

392
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,860
every these limitations and those every

393
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,020
every kind of the protection from the

394
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,539
radio frequencies will affect uh on the

395
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,539
Telecom operators uh it's also effect on

396
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,940
the 4G network but so it's crucial for

397
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,700
the 5G Network as it uses higher

398
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,520
frequencies frequencies from 6 to 100

399
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,160
gigahertz

400
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,240
so go

401
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,340
well this is a simple illustration that

402
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,380
when the wave is going from one

403
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,160
alignment to another one it's

404
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:07,020
reflects or refracts and so it's a

405
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,539
it has some modification so it lose the

406
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:13,440
quality which will then we'll get a

407
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,179
little speed or increase the latency and

408
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,880
it's more visible in case of high

409
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,620
frequency waves

410
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,840
so

411
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,400
uh

412
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,660
let me so go in normal cases when we are

413
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,880
talking about the Telecom operators so

414
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,360
we calculated free space lawsuit so in

415
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,520
normal case it's a atmosphere loss and

416
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,340
in that case we have to consider the

417
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,039
building weather conditions so and so on

418
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:51,000
uh which happens on the earth so this is

419
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,460
a normal girl okay so when we have one

420
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,039
transmitter which sends a signal and

421
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,559
then another one who greases the signals

422
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,380
and there is a medium where they could

423
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,320
be loose equality of the signal and we

424
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,799
lose the time also the frequent the

425
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,400
latency is increased in our case uh to

426
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,980
summarize the limitations of building

427
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,100
materials so

428
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,380
will protect and not protect but yes

429
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,600
protect the humans from the 5G network

430
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,840
but it will cause the limitations for

431
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,820
critical Services

432
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,360
um to be cooperated under 5G networks so

433
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,620
now it in 5G network if you are if your

434
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,900
device needs to connect to the go high

435
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,539
band or from 6 gigahertz to 100

436
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,419
gigahertz it should be near to the near

437
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,120
to these cell towers uh if you are far

438
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,360
from this kind of tower your mobile will

439
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,419
automatically switch to another Tower

440
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:54,179
which is where the distance is much more

441
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,120
so go the locating your device will be

442
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,080
difficult so when I know that my device

443
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,419
is connected to the high band I know

444
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,580
that I'm near to the cell tower and

445
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,760
knowing only ID and the light to Network

446
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,000
YouTube which is open I can determine my

447
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,480
location so because with the

448
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,460
so we tried to

449
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,160
we tried to calculate the signal the

450
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,520
attached request when the device were

451
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,380
trying to connect to the cell tower and

452
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,740
try to modify uh the target I mean

453
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,220
Target of the network ID the ID of the

454
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,220
cell tower local ID local region ID and

455
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,400
the network ID in 4D Network it was

456
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,620
quite easy here you see the packet

457
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,559
details so which can be seen as a

458
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,539
Wireshark and it looks through because

459
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:54,059
of in a background process or

460
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,159
simultaneously the cell towers are

461
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,100
communicating with users and also user

462
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,419
assignments the devices are

463
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,340
communicating with cell towers and

464
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,360
trying to say that I'm the device is the

465
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,760
SIM card with IDs like em EI and imsi

466
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,980
and please let me connect to your

467
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,740
network it's a

468
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,880
background the process and happens so

469
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,720
always and when we try to go catch this

470
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,260
information uh here's a radio network

471
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,380
code identifier 144 and also we have

472
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,620
cell identifier so in that case so we

473
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,600
were able to determine on which Tower

474
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,960
the user was trying to connect so go if

475
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,419
we can catch this request we can modify

476
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,240
these parameters and force the user to

477
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,120
every time connect to the hybrid

478
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,760
frequency network no matter of the

479
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,039
signals ranks in that case so we'll be

480
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,240
able to map all the CT and find the

481
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,720
exact location by one buy only one cell

482
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,840
tower so this also one illustration

483
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,480
where the IDS of the cell towers are

484
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,659
cached but it's like packets need to

485
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,760
between the Google send between cell

486
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,620
tower end users so to conclude my

487
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,600
PlayStation is it so

488
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,039
this processes also go able to do in

489
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,620
previous generation networks but because

490
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,780
of the frequency the user is not

491
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,659
required to be next to the towers so we

492
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,100
connected in 5G Network because of the

493
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,700
some limitations of building subjects so

494
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,940
the frequency is highly effective by

495
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,159
different objects so we have to be near

496
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,059
to the towers so if the request from the

497
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,919
device to the cell tower is sent to an

498
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,860
encrypted way I am able to catch this

499
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,640
request and modify the target so the

500
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,700
force the device to connect every time

501
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,740
or try to connect to the high band

502
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,320
Network and in that case I will be able

503
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,020
to go find its location without knowing

504
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,299
those three towers which is not a high

505
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,039
accuracy at this point

506
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,620
uh so go

507
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,080
please questions uh if you have any

508
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,120
questions thank you for attention yes

509
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,700
thank you Georgie for a wonderful

510
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,039
presentation yes we have questions in

511
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,659
the audience

512
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,260
hi uh you mentioned that for this

513
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,020
tracking you need the assault fake cell

514
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,039
towers

515
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:32,960
yeah

516
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,100
yes so it's so easy to create one so you

517
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,500
can use a phone or what kind of device

518
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,020
model device do you need to use because

519
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,840
I suppose this type of chips used in

520
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,539
cell towers are proprietary so heart of

521
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,360
gain and obtain

522
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,640
uh thank you for the question uh it was

523
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
a simulation of

524
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,220
micro lab of our

525
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,380
set up by the Raspberry Pi so and Trust

526
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,720
transfers and receivers and we have

527
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,539
created the go one towers that were

528
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,880
spreading the same the details say cell

529
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,640
tower is spreading and we were able to

530
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,200
cut this request and cut you so client

531
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,840
from the network so yes you

532
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,820
so you can create actually using

533
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,200
Raspberry Pi

534
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,419
to to simulate it that's not the real

535
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,700
one but for the simulation yes okay okay

536
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,600
and the second question is now you're

537
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,320
tackled with the 5G right are you saying

538
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,740
that 4G or 3G it's much more secure from

539
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,460
this perspective oh thank you for uh

540
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,679
answering questions no go we are not

541
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,860
approving this one uh the same problem

542
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,039
is a 4G network but because of the scope

543
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,400
of the network is the 5G is going to

544
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,240
incorporate difference the industries

545
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,880
and also the portion of the AI will be

546
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,580
go high like emergency services medical

547
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,580
devices sales devices and optimization

548
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,520
robots so because the security will be

549
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,159
more uh

550
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,860
will be more targeted by the attackers

551
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,440
and the previous one and human implanted

552
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,620
chips I suppose sorry human implanted

553
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,100
chips I suppose future our future yeah

554
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,500
thank you thank you very much

555
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,720
thank you guys any other questions from

556
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,659
the audience yes I have a guys hand over

557
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,020
here

558
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,419
do you think in the future this program

559
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,480
the tracking on 5G will be that big one

560
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,520
that the governance the government

561
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,279
should step in and do some uh

562
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,400
limitations from the software or reduce

563
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,059
the ban

564
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,480
um

565
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,960
okay so go let me repeat your question

566
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,900
you're asking about if I'm working the

567
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,960
with the government to make some

568
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,760
limitations or regulations to know to

569
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,260
block these kind of frequencies or

570
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,260
something like this yes the tracking

571
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,960
would be I think too precise in the

572
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,299
future so they should reduce it or too

573
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:21,000
easy for people to track other people or

574
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,580
taste in fact oh oh okay thank you for

575
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,220
the question it's very interesting uh

576
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,880
yesterday the future goal is to find the

577
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,159
solution how to protect ourselves from

578
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,740
this tracking but at this point uh I'm

579
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,960
not working with the government to find

580
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,440
some regulations because uh this whole

581
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,299
infrastructure and the changing whole

582
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,000
infrastructure from my point of view is

583
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,080
not

584
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,740
um

585
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,559
now reasonable we should find some

586
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,440
protecting mechanics and try to change

587
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,539
the whole infrastructure or change to

588
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,659
try to change the uh the physics okay

589
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,840
it's so all about so we need these

590
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,820
frequencies we need some kind of uh

591
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,179
standards or

592
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:10,940
um

593
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,820
architecture or the design to get these

594
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,179
services so go go we should not go and

595
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,940
say that let's blocks a high frequency

596
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,460
radio waves or high frequency radio

597
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,620
waves in telecon communication so I

598
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,320
think we should try to find the solution

599
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,260
and now we are working at this point how

600
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,120
to minimize the risk of user the device

601
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,799
tracking

602
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,720
okay

603
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,120
any other questions yes we have another

604
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,580
question over here

605
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,419
thank you uh yeah did you have

606
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,360
opportunity to test your approach

607
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,039
okay thank you go for the question uh in

608
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,679
our case

609
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,880
in Georgia uh

610
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,440
injured here right now because the 5G

611
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,000
network is not officially operated it's

612
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,640
provided by the Telecom operator so for

613
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,580
testing purposes we have set up some

614
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,020
funding and puts some devices and in the

615
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,779
case the simulation was shown only

616
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:22,760
example or on 4G network so go

617
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,779
it's a

618
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,799
you know like we are talking this way so

619
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,340
countries with 5G like turkey go to find

620
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,460
some joint project and to make the

621
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,380
testing all this year environment and

622
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,840
all these ideas and the new Solutions

623
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,600
and functions so go because we are also

624
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,659
working uh some ideas systems and IPS

625
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,600
for the 5G Network and we need to test

626
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,840
it in practical way no team simulation

627
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,500
thank you

628
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,480
awesome any other questions in the

629
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,720
audience yes no definite maybe yes yes

630
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,460
please please raise your hands if you

631
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,559
have any questions if not I have a

632
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,700
question

633
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,080
um how much of the 5G technology is

634
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,620
dependent on the IPv6

635
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,159
if any how much uh cynical just depends

636
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:18,059
on

637
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,840
for example in all 5G Technologies you

638
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,360
are going to have to

639
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,240
communicate over a fast Network and

640
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,360
you're going to need some IPS and how

641
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,659
much of the 5G technology is going to be

642
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,799
dependent on the IPv6 technology or IPv6

643
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,380
IPS

644
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,020
in order to have another enough

645
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,899
IPS in order to connect you'll have the

646
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,279
internet of things as you mentioned

647
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,620
you'll have a lot of devices connected

648
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,260
to the same

649
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,799
um the same tower for example for a 5G

650
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,220
so pretty much you'll need a way to

651
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,679
serve the information for all those

652
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,820
connected connected IPS so ipv4 what

653
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,399
you're doing now as a technology when

654
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,039
you assign the IP

655
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,600
on ipv4 to the next call and so on so

656
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,700
forth so forth may not be also available

657
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,100
if you're going to use a different kind

658
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,360
of

659
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,000
I know protection for devices like

660
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,580
medical devices or whatever

661
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,740
uh thank you for the question uh

662
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,940
right now for me it's difficult to

663
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,059
answer this question because I am not

664
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:40,679
received this topic of area but I think

665
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,740
because the idea of the IPv6 when it's

666
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,860
they said say a limitation of the ipv4

667
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,080
the numbers it's we're going to the IPv6

668
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,980
and I think it's it's solution right now

669
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,840
but so

670
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,100
um

671
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,520
this is not my

672
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,440
my field of studies so right now I

673
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,659
cannot answer exact questions thank you

674
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:06,059
oh we have

675
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,480
we have e

676
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,299
answer your question it doesn't matter

677
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:14,640
ipv4 or IPv6 as long as you have enough

678
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,659
enough IP addresses on your network

679
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,940
thank you

680
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,720
great so guys if we don't have any other

681
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,360
questions please oh yes we do have

682
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,020
another question

683
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,299
hello if you want to improve uh device

684
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,520
tracking

685
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,539
in a 5G Network can you use a faked 5G

686
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,820
Towers in a

687
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,460
sport area or something like that

688
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,080
uh

689
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,299
further improving if you're going to use

690
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,299
a simulation networks or fake networks

691
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:54,260
could you specify the question both

692
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:00,240
okay for the solution we're going to go

693
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,360
test every hour ideas and solution is a

694
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,760
real environment that's why we are

695
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,820
working with the Telecom operators and

696
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,220
international we have submitted some of

697
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,240
links to buy all this infrastructure in

698
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,860
Georgia to try and to start the testing

699
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,340
in Real Environment because all the

700
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,080
simulations and all the tests

701
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,880
environment is not enough for the

702
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,399
development deployment to the standards

703
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:32,039
it should be tested in different

704
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,380
environment but in real one not the

705
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,519
simulation

706
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,700
okay thank you thank you

707
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,679
well thank you let's have a big account

708
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,940
of Applause for Georgine

709
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,459
um
