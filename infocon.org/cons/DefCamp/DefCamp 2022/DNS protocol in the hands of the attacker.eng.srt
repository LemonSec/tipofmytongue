1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,240
thank you thank you very much so it's

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,980
great to be here when I learned that

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,200
I'll be the last presenter today I

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,880
didn't expect crowd like this I was

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,160
thinking of oh hell five o'clock who

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,799
will be here so I'm really happy that uh

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,859
it's so many people in in the state in

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,500
the room with me so just uh briefly to

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,840
introduce myself uh I'm andreines I'm

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,820
based in Czech Republic but I'm covering

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,779
this region and uh doing uh this uh hunt

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,599
of threats are in malware that is using

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,700
DNS for a few last few years and I as

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,380
well joined info blocks in uh by

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,780
basically almost two years back so just

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,820
really briefly to skip the marketing

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,079
part because this is the on last

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,360
marketing slide I have for you and

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,399
infoblox is American company based in

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,500
Santa Clara and we are focusing on

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,059
securing the users by using DNS as a as

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,520
a effective method so let's go through

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,800
the parts of DNS right how attackers are

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,159
actually capable of doing some stuff

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,860
with DNS where they can use that because

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,460
as all of us know DNS is basically IP to

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,159
name resolution basically just connect

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,320
those together so if you want to go to

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,200
the google.com well you don't know the

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,840
IP address but you know google.com right

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,740
so this is something that is basically

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,380
an open database you can store

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,240
information in and you you can read

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,159
information out so you just simply

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,640
follow the RFC so what I'm presenting

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,680
you right now what is on the slide right

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,259
now that's a cyber kill chain framework

38
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,460
it's uh it was developed back when logit

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,680
Martin was actual attacked and this is

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
basically a picture of their experience

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,299
what the attacker needs to do in order

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,420
to be anyhow successful so what we are

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,600
looking at is not some small phishing or

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,180
some kind of spammer or something like

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,460
that's on some Niche group no we are

46
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,740
talking about advanced persistent groups

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,200
that have decided I have the Target and

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,520
I want to get in

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,640
so right now you are seeing a seven of

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,819
different steps on the screen and only

51
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,099
with two of them you don't see any kind

52
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,260
of nodes that DNS would be involved

53
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,500
inside that so basically it's a basic

54
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,480
protocol and with security we should

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,000
start with the basics right so have a

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,580
look on number one reconnaissance so

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,260
what is that

58
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,660
that's basically the attacker doing its

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,120
homework it's uh the attacker learning

60
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,500
from any available resource what can be

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,959
used with DNS obviously you can do

62
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,360
reconnaissance just simply go to The

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760
Domain that you want of the victim the

64
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,800
domain that there is some of its domain

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,260
and just ask about records you will get

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,599
an IP address you will get maybe how

67
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,519
many name servers where are the name

68
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,500
servers so with the name service you

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,420
will name maybe even learn if they have

70
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,920
some male security

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,720
if they are doing something with Spam

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,060
because we will see txt records like SFP

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,000
records so all of that is basically in

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,400
in the reconnaissance part attacker is

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,379
doing the homework to collect any

76
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,720
necessary information of course it's not

77
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,780
only DNS but I will focus on DNS to be

78
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,620
sure

79
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,040
the second part is weaponization so that

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,099
I have learned that the company is using

81
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,340
this or that and it's based uh in

82
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,560
somewhere so they will basically use all

83
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,900
this information to create something

84
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,819
that might be delivered in the second

85
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,720
phase it may be link it may be payload

86
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,760
like xfile

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,819
maybe doc file something something can

88
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,980
can be delivered and that's the part

89
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,900
number three the delivery

90
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,560
so as you might already know or you

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,739
probably may know uh the delivery part

92
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,360
even the

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,180
icon on the number three it's usually in

94
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,200
mail

95
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,620
most attacks like 90 of attacks start

96
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,620
with an email because it's most easiest

97
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,739
part to get something in

98
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,840
well I usually say that ninety percent

99
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
of attack starts with an email how many

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,858
emails starts with DNS

101
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,779
I'll hold them uh so this is like the

102
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,180
delivery part so when you actually think

103
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,880
about it the DNS can be something that

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,259
there is some kind of resolution process

105
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,780
again to get domain IP address to

106
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,300
basically send the mail and uh with this

107
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,820
you can actually get an answer so the

108
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,040
DNS part inside here I'm not talking

109
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
about emails but it can be the

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,960
resolution can be actually the way how

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,520
somebody can get some other information

112
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,440
inside the company

113
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,680
so the DNS infiltration might be here as

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,259
well as the delivery part

115
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,740
after that we have exploitation so

116
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,660
what's the exploitation what's this all

117
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,000
about so attacker have successfully

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
delivered something now he wants to run

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,000
it

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,220
and uh but when you're thinking about

121
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,139
running the malova or some kind of

122
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,419
exploit you basically are thinking with

123
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,479
connection to DNS oh servers right the

124
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,580
DNS survival attack the DNS server and

125
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,280
the DNS server will most probably start

126
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,620
to run some kind of script or maybe some

127
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,840
some exploit something will happen

128
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,720
well I would actually say you're right

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,840
but as well every single machine like a

130
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,940
normal like a phone with modern

131
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,300
operation system laptop everything it

132
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,720
does have some DNS code in it so it's

133
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,680
not only servers it's also every single

134
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,080
machine and that machine can be

135
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,500
um it can trigger exploit to misbehave

136
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,320
and do some harm

137
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,560
so that was uh part number four to

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,380
explore the exploitation

139
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,780
so the attacker has runs something

140
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,360
obviously if it runs in memory then you

141
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,639
will have a PC that will restart play

142
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,320
the own reception will just simply close

143
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,780
the PC to go home so it will be done

144
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,880
right so the attackers don't like that

145
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,340
attackers like to stay

146
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,919
so they will do some kind of scheduled

147
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,199
tasks they will do whatever so they will

148
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,660
try to do this installation obviously no

149
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,300
DNS in this because well what you can do

150
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,580
it with that what you will do is like

151
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,560
install it like schedule task or

152
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,080
something that will run with start

153
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,080
so then we are actually getting to the

154
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,280
sixth face

155
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,860
I usually like to say that the face

156
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,740
number six is the most noisy part of

157
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,759
them all

158
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,500
most likely we'll get some kind of

159
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,660
detection in here but have a look it's

160
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,840
number six quite a lot of quite a lot of

161
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,180
things have to happen before the number

162
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,020
six can happen no will be done so with

163
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,539
that with the commanding control again

164
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,300
what you can do basically hide the

165
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,259
messages

166
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,300
I've seen command and control over email

167
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,340
I've seen command and control over

168
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,860
Google drive but as well you can see

169
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,800
commanding control over DNS

170
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,199
and I will show you later on a few nice

171
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,639
examples of that

172
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,780
so with the sixth part it's basically

173
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,520
how to hide the message

174
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
that will be not seen

175
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,580
and number seven this is last part this

176
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,800
is the action of objectives because

177
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,720
attackers have some kind of objective

178
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,539
they will have something to do like

179
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,180
steal the data encrypt the data Maybe

180
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,759
disturb the services do whatever they

181
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,220
like to test their part of the attacks

182
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,919
so that's their objective but I used to

183
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,319
also say this is too late because the

184
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,720
attacker can do whatever he wanted to do

185
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,360
in the first place at this stage and as

186
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,180
you can see we can have like again DNS

187
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,280
resolution process and you can Excel

188
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,400
trade data using DNS protocol

189
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
so why I was telling you all of this in

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,280
so many words that you might say hey I

191
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,080
know that yeah why you are rambling all

192
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
about about this one

193
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,440
so that's because I would like to show

194
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,139
you a few nice examples

195
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,660
so first example that I've prepared for

196
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,840
you it's uh

197
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,960
apt-34 it's a Iranian group you might

198
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,379
know it as Hell's Kitchen or Ulrich and

199
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,300
these guys have targeted Jordanian

200
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,220
government

201
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,160
so how they done it is via email

202
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,800
actually two emails first one here

203
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,839
second one here

204
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,260
and they were pretending to be an I.T

205
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,820
employees

206
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,979
basically some kind of phishing tactic

207
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,080
but if you think about it this is this

208
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,660
is already step number three so they had

209
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,720
to have to do the you know the homework

210
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,360
to find out you know who is the great

211
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,279
person to send this email and they had

212
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,200
to do the step number two and it's

213
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,440
actually

214
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,380
this Excel sheet that was attached

215
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,060
so

216
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,459
you would say okay so they send some

217
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,320
Excel sheets to some kind of person

218
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,680
what's inside the Excel sheet

219
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,560
in the Excel sheet there was this was

220
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,480
relying on the person who received that

221
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,600
email that he will allow the macros

222
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,519
not necessary with every single attack

223
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,200
that you might see but in this

224
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,180
particular case they relied on that so

225
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,040
they relied on the person that he will

226
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,320
do but that's not that uncommon in big

227
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
organizations that there are macros that

228
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,800
are being used

229
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,100
so they relied on macro then because

230
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,560
they done their homework and they

231
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,080
learned about the victim and this was

232
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,779
government so most probably open tenders

233
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,000
they learned that there might be some

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,060
male security solution

235
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,740
and in this particular case it was

236
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,200
sandbox they know about so how to avoid

237
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,459
sandbox

238
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,320
well the first thing that the macro have

239
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,740
done is just simply asking hey machine

240
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,680
do you have Mouse

241
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,100
because show me sandbox solution to have

242
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,260
that have Mouse connected

243
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,019
mostly most of those sandbox Solutions

244
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,899
there will be virtual machines that's

245
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,700
basically the second ballot it's the

246
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,279
sandbox elevation techniques so they

247
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,620
knew that there might be some sandbox so

248
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,200
let's not focus fight with that let's

249
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,240
just go around

250
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,120
so another steps that were happening so

251
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,140
every

252
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,200
um every action was basically recorded

253
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
on execution step was reported via DNS

254
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,220
queries

255
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,820
that are like this the qw ID of the step

256
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,339
random number plus some kind of domain

257
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,860
name so we have example in the line

258
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,620
below and this was basically the green

259
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,079
light this was the commanding control

260
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,779
message for the comma from for the

261
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:52,800
attacker

262
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
and maybe first question what do you do

263
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,320
if you want to resolve and domain name

264
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,839
what is the easiest option how to do it

265
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,120
without using dig or nslookup

266
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,779
pink exactly so

267
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,480
what the malware done was basically a

268
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,180
call within 32 pink status VMI function

269
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,120
that is embedded in an Excel form

270
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,040
the rest of the lines

271
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,100
of the Excel sheet was actually not

272
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,200
something that the person have expected

273
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,519
in those base base 64 encoded backdoor

274
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,680
that was stored in the user forums so

275
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,959
every single line it was looking like a

276
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,360
form but it was not a formula it was

277
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,640
basically this embedded backdoor

278
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,920
what I also like that they stick to the

279
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,100
schedule of running every four hours for

280
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,620
20 days so if the victim have not

281
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,899
detected for 20 days they would not

282
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,220
detect it at all

283
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,940
so let's talk about the back door

284
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,240
the back door inside was.net binary

285
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,700
it's basically this Santana back door

286
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,000
and it was executing a pre-coded

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,320
Powershell and commanding control

288
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,980
commands in order to

289
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,079
execute command or maybe download

290
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,860
another part of a malware and do some

291
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,200
other harm and damage so how this

292
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,000
commanding control messages might look

293
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,640
like you'll see actually over here

294
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,820
with an IP addresses that for us it

295
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,800
looks like IP addresses but would you

296
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,719
say that those were IP addresses

297
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,060
they were actually not an IP addresses

298
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,220
for example on the first row the last

299
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,700
octet was ID of the victim

300
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,740
it's a number

301
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,480
let's think about the attacker for the

302
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,880
attacker it's not an IP address

303
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,320
it's how much 32 bits of data

304
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,060
think about data space

305
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,639
uh so this is what have been happening

306
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,100
so if there was some kind of uh problem

307
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,660
on DNS level

308
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,959
obviously the delay was much higher like

309
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,880
for example sleep for six to eight hours

310
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,639
to avoid detection so when you are

311
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,320
looking at this attack you are looking

312
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,959
at the really Advanced group they was

313
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,760
thinking okay we don't want to get

314
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,700
detected so what they do if there is a

315
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,800
problem do nothing

316
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,380
and it's nothing there is not the alert

317
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,480
right

318
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,279
so the domain names that they were using

319
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,220
they actually got

320
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,660
registered like two to three months

321
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,800
before

322
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,600
because if you are talking about like

323
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,360
Niche attackers they will not likely

324
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,639
register the domain create a good

325
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,800
reputation for it they will register the

326
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,600
domain and use it immediately

327
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,060
these guys have the patience these guys

328
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,760
want it not to be detected so there are

329
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,100
techniques like newly observed domains

330
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,260
newly registered domains you can avoid

331
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,139
all of that but this these guys had the

332
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,980
patience to do it do so

333
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,540
so

334
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,240
these are this was the example of the

335
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,120
signed Dynamic door have any money now

336
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,019
thought about use of DNS like this

337
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,760
or is it something that you see for the

338
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,060
first time

339
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
silence okay

340
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,760
so let's move on to an enter one example

341
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,180
so this one is a model from

342
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,540
you might know breakbot

343
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,560
trickbot and their

344
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
variants of trick but there is plenty of

345
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
variants so this is only one of them

346
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,459
this anchor DNS and you might say hey

347
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,560
and that's not not something new why are

348
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,800
issuing was this slide and I'm showing

349
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,300
this to you because

350
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,940
these guys have decided to Target

351
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,920
financial sector and they decided to

352
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,980
Target the high importance machines

353
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,980
inside and inside the victims so they

354
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,720
were actually accessing the active

355
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,760
directory controllers

356
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,000
and when you have active directory what

357
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,760
else do you have

358
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,880
you have DNS server because it relies on

359
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,600
it

360
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,139
and this anchor DNS was basically and

361
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,579
the way how to do commanding control

362
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,440
communication and they were actually

363
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,779
selling this access to other

364
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,120
attackers basically done on business

365
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,459
with that so what do you what is what is

366
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,040
actual is is down below you basically

367
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
see uh what was containing contention of

368
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,500
the messages sent by

369
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,320
um DNS commodity control over DNS but

370
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,600
because on DNS you cannot send slash

371
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,060
because that's not allowed character you

372
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,899
see like anchor DNS host name version uh

373
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,779
some client identification the last part

374
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,760
is what version of trickball it does

375
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,519
that is so you cannot send it over DNS

376
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,100
like this so what they have done they've

377
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,560
just used a sort function with this key

378
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,839
to basically get something that you can

379
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,019
send over DNS

380
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,880
uh and I'm not I'm not showing you

381
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
because of the trig bot uh this anchor

382
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,100
DNS module I would like oh I will I'm

383
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,380
actually showing you because of another

384
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,160
thing that uh is nice and use of such a

385
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,380
thing such such access

386
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,480
uh by the way if you would say I have

387
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,420
Linux and I'm safe don't worry they've

388
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,339
thought about that as well so there is a

389
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,740
version for Linux also

390
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,839
so all the things that are why I'm

391
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,380
showing you this is use of such a module

392
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,440
use of such a commuting control this is

393
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,139
the ryak ransomware

394
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,839
how it was spread well guess what email

395
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,120
with DocuSign or Excel sheets

396
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,019
and they basically loaded the baser

397
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,959
holder and cobal stripe Beacon and after

398
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,000
that they done the command and control

399
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,180
communication with anchor DNS

400
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,820
so something that was seen and we knew

401
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,399
it from the past because the anchor DNS

402
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,060
is something that is from what 2017.

403
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,640
basically it's not new it's nothing new

404
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,400
but you see the use of that

405
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,299
later on so this is an example of

406
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,699
command and control communication and as

407
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,339
well on the picture and sorry for that

408
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,579
it's not nice picture from the rear I

409
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,040
suppose but every single line that you

410
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,140
see on on this table

411
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,119
this is basically control command and

412
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,940
control message that gots an IP address

413
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,679
back

414
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,820
for us

415
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,400
it's not an IP address it's a commanding

416
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,080
control response

417
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,360
32 bits of data

418
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
but the malware ransomware in this case

419
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,240
will send queries like this to basically

420
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,480
get some kind of trigger

421
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,320
so let's also talk about what we can do

422
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,360
about that because I've shown you two

423
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,880
examples I have plenty of other examples

424
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,280
but in 40 minutes that's not something

425
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
that I can go through if you would like

426
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,200
to see much more of those examples let

427
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,240
us know because we are doing a little

428
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,760
bit more advanced education about use of

429
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,820
DNS by attackers we are going through

430
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,220
many other examples of malware using DNS

431
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,160
in much more detail but what we are

432
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,539
capable of doing about this

433
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,480
problem is basically have a look on

434
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,580
every single query and what we are doing

435
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,260
we are using three three different

436
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,840
methods we are doing signature detection

437
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,000
we are doing reputation and behavior

438
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,380
analysis

439
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,799
so to have some kind of reputation based

440
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
you actually have to have threat

441
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,240
intelligence because without that

442
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,820
you basically might say okay this domain

443
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,419
is bad but for what how it's bad uh is

444
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:52,500
it bad still

445
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,380
you might not know so what we do is we

446
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,960
create our own threat intelligence we

447
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,280
are looking on the traffic of our

448
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,080
customers and as well we are looking at

449
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,480
like our threat researchers are actively

450
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,179
looking on the malware and are trying to

451
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,880
find different uses

452
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,059
and different iocs that can be shared

453
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,460
with the threat intelligence but as well

454
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,260
when you have been talking where we are

455
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,539
talking about DNS because we are the DNS

456
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:22,500
resolver so the reputation is best in

457
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,140
terms of ease of computing power because

458
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,120
you just compare the list and you will

459
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,460
see hey I know that bad domain bad

460
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,260
reputation block it

461
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,660
and with DNS if you don't give IP

462
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,940
address back there is no no

463
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,520
communication that can happen

464
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,559
but I would like to talk about the

465
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,320
behavior part because the behavior might

466
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,760
be something that you'll be interested

467
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,460
in much more I've shown you some command

468
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,820
and control examples use I hope you've

469
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,700
seen on at least on the rack how these

470
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,980
messages might look like but I would

471
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,480
like to describe you a little bit more

472
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,240
why this behavior analysis is so cool

473
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,980
and so powerful

474
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,340
so what they are actually seeing is a

475
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,340
rating algorithm that is going through

476
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,500
different detection methods in order to

477
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,260
do to determine if that query that has

478
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,720
been sent if it's okay or if it's

479
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,220
malicious

480
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,940
so what they are looking at is algorithm

481
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,039
that will go through every single DNS

482
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,400
query and response both directions and

483
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,559
analyze different techniques and tactics

484
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,320
in order to determine is good or bad so

485
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,660
we see entropy lexical engram frequency

486
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,179
size it's much more but every single

487
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,340
detection method is good for something a

488
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,559
little bit little bit different

489
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,799
so when we are talking for example the

490
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,900
entropy

491
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,240
uh everybody familiar with entropy

492
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,220
everybody knows what it is

493
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,860
good great so randomness of of

494
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,320
characters so entropy is actually quite

495
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,360
good and nice method

496
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,260
but its drawback is a tendency to be

497
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,700
false positive

498
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,980
so if you look at the graph the green is

499
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,679
good red is bad and the brown is

500
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,140
potential false positive

501
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,059
I see quite a lot of it

502
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,419
so it's not the Silver Bullet that you

503
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,460
might look for because it's not okay

504
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,700
enough to just go with entropy but it

505
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,679
can give you quite a nice detection rate

506
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,919
so it can detect quite a lot if you have

507
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,840
a script that will create and generate

508
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
some kind of domain name

509
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,760
then the entropy will be high and then

510
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,620
you will be able to see what's that

511
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,220
some examples of entropy scores that are

512
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,820
on the screen right now so www is

513
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,100
entropy of zero because no Randomness is

514
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,080
the same character

515
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,559
um other other scores are inside so as

516
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,539
you can see even special characters it

517
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,340
doesn't matter it's basically a

518
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,860
character that's it's repeating or not

519
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,620
but nice detection method so we do take

520
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,419
a score and move on

521
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,179
another quite nice detection method is

522
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,860
engram analysis

523
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,020
we are doing something that is called

524
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,320
two gram and three gram big rum and

525
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,220
three gram so we are looking at the

526
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,919
ratio of probability that two characters

527
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,919
are by each other and can be by each

528
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,140
other so if you have a human created

529
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,380
domain name usually we are looking for

530
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,419
something that does make sense for us

531
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,179
humans if you have script that is

532
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,039
creating this domain name or if you have

533
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,720
something that is creating some kind of

534
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,600
name for commanding control

535
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
well the script doesn't care it will do

536
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,260
like qwqz qy but do you know any words

537
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,240
that will start or have these characters

538
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,539
by each other probably not because we

539
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,080
don't use that so engram is another

540
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,380
characterization that we are doing and

541
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,659
we are checking two characters

542
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,000
all over the query and also we are

543
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,280
tricking three characters so that's how

544
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
we are detecting okay this communication

545
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,480
looks weird this communication is maybe

546
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,600
generated and it's not healthy

547
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,780
so this is the source of of this uh of

548
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,900
this classification you can see that ad

549
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,159
and Ed

550
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,980
these characters are much more Parable

551
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,100
to have by each other because edit admin

552
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,020
those words exist

553
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,960
but again the probability of how and

554
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,960
these other characters it's much lower

555
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,659
so this is the lion work that Google

556
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,820
have done because they have took books

557
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,100
from

558
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,980
1900 Century till 2019 and down and gram

559
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,080
analysis over them in multiple languages

560
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,000
so we can we actually do have

561
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,700
information about multiple languages so

562
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,380
this is the source that we are doing

563
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,020
over the um engram analysis

564
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,760
so these were just examples what the

565
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,460
algorithm is doing so for example if you

566
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,740
had if you would have a DGA that's

567
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,720
domain generating algorithm that's this

568
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,480
is a way how to avoid reputation by

569
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,520
attackers right if you want to have a

570
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,020
reputation just create domain that

571
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,679
doesn't have any so this is examples of

572
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,100
different generated algorithms so this

573
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,799
different generated domain names

574
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,039
and the attacker knows the algorithm how

575
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,320
these domain names will be generated so

576
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,240
he will know that tomorrow at three

577
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,700
o'clock I will have that domain name so

578
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,100
I will register it up front and I will

579
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,720
have the communication to the commanding

580
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,460
control server

581
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,860
well we'll learn and many other security

582
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,600
vendors have learned how to detect

583
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,039
things like this total nonsense.tld so

584
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,020
what the attacker have done what the

585
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,240
attacker have thought of hey let's

586
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,640
create another way how to generate the

587
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,020
domain names

588
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,780
so they created the so-called dictionary

589
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,840
DGA so what is this is that you will

590
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,820
take two three four different

591
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,580
dictionaries and just place the words

592
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,980
together to generate a domain name

593
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,320
so if you have a look on this Supple box

594
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,000
example it's smaller family that is

595
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,280
using that tell me what is wrong with

596
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,320
phasegone.net

597
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,659
would you say hey the domain was

598
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,039
generated

599
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,260
most probably not because if you have a

600
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,960
look and gram analysis is good

601
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,080
entropy is good like SQL analysis would

602
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,299
be good everything will be fine

603
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:37,279
so how to actually be able to say that

604
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,260
worklift.net is generated to my name

605
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,840
so for that we have actually leveraged

606
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,960
the theory of graphs and we have uh we

607
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,159
have discovered or we are basically

608
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,679
basically seen that the Achilles heel of

609
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,179
such a technique is basically uh the

610
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,880
repeating words

611
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,220
the dictionaries are not endless

612
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,559
so with that we are actually seeing

613
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,159
different words being repeated in this

614
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,340
short example just few words that are

615
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,860
repeating because normally even you are

616
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,880
talking about the normal healthy domain

617
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,799
names they are in here

618
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,779
equal spread of different characters in

619
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,760
different words but if you are talking

620
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,919
about the ga generated you will find

621
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,440
them here so what you see is tight

622
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,200
chunks of words that are repeating again

623
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,299
and again and again

624
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,640
so this is actually something that uh we

625
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,140
are capable of doing

626
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,200
uh I haven't seen anybody else that is

627
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
as well capable of doing such a thing

628
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,419
like this

629
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:45,179
so this is uh this is the way how you

630
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:48,919
can actually detect dictionary DGA

631
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,480
uh how to create another way of think of

632
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,360
attackers of full link users because

633
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,240
users will be always to be linked there

634
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,419
will be always somebody who will misread

635
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,240
Miss click misinterpret

636
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,340
so if the attacker would like to create

637
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,620
some kind of domain that will be look

638
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,760
alike

639
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,980
it's quite plenty of things that the

640
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,659
attacker might do

641
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,600
so it can be addition of letter on the

642
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,360
end it can be repeating of the letters

643
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,820
in the middle it can be placing dots

644
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,100
somewhere immediately for the machine is

645
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,200
totally different domain name

646
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,500
so this is something the attackers also

647
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,539
think about in when they are looking at

648
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,340
hey

649
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,000
let's plan a phishing campaign or maybe

650
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,940
hey let's attack Germany and government

651
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,980
let's pretend like

652
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,020
and that's uh some a little bit of game

653
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,940
that I would like to play with you

654
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,539
because it's already almost time is

655
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,580
already gone almost so I would like to

656
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,860
play a little bit of game with you so

657
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,159
who can tell me

658
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,500
what PayPal is the correct PayPal to

659
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,700
click on

660
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,179
yes

661
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,480
yeah so as I forgot about that so if you

662
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,460
have seen it and I've told you already

663
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,340
please do not vote or maybe you can vote

664
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,580
anonymously but uh you will most likely

665
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,520
the recognize what is the wrong PayPal

666
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
the middle one but hands up who will say

667
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,679
it is the first PayPal is correct

668
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,900
one two

669
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,059
who will say the last PayPal is the

670
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,480
correct one

671
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,419
and you'll be right is it lucky guess or

672
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,440
you have seen a difference

673
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,600
it's a lucky guess most probably because

674
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,360
actually the characters are the same

675
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,279
they are just different codes because

676
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,400
you can have our alphabets like uh

677
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,980
Cyrillic and Latin

678
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,559
both character sets have those

679
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,120
characters

680
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,279
just the one that you don't want to use

681
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,600
will have a little bit different code

682
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,960
behind it for the machine it's totally

683
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,059
different domain name meaning totally

684
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,220
different destination

685
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,179
so by the way browsers in a URL field

686
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,419
they should show you this homographic

687
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,059
writing so it's X and dash dash then the

688
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,880
the string without the without the

689
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,520
special character and then you see the

690
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,380
the code of the character that is the

691
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,240
special one

692
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,960
and now level up what is the good Google

693
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,960
the first one hands up

694
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,240
second one

695
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,679
and third one

696
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,179
you don't want to vote because you

697
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,760
cannot know the answer right so let's

698
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,740
see well the first one was the guy right

699
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,520
it was the correct one

700
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,919
so if you see this can you blame the

701
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:53,880
user

702
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,740
that he clicked on the wrong link

703
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,440
yes you can but uh

704
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,020
imagine yourself in his position

705
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,840
so he was sing clicking and it was on

706
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,760
something else so this is another thing

707
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,860
that you can focus with DNS because for

708
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:15,899
DNS every single link is this line

709
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,979
so it's different

710
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,620
so key takeaways from my session so

711
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,039
DNS is open distributed database you can

712
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,380
place information in you can read

713
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,360
information out

714
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,460
it doesn't mean that something is

715
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,500
doesn't exist doesn't mean that it

716
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,000
cannot have a meaning

717
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,919
so the queries that I have shown you

718
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,679
most likely haven't ever existed as a

719
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,080
records but for the attacker it doesn't

720
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,779
matter for the attacker it's some string

721
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,840
dot his domain name is the string is

722
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,340
what he's get

723
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,700
so it can contain any information

724
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,120
as well the DNS is basically another

725
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,279
term protocol that will get you the data

726
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,140
from point A to point B

727
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,279
and when you have resolvers remember

728
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,620
that if you ask your resolver and the

729
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,840
resolver will not know the name know the

730
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,779
answer he will create his own new

731
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,720
session with its known source IP to

732
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
create to find you the answer on the

733
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,100
internet so they are actually like

734
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,799
acting like a proxies

735
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,720
so this is everything that I've prepared

736
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,500
for you so if you have questions now is

737
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,140
the time but otherwise thank you very

738
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,299
much for staying so late and I hope that

739
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,810
you enjoy the conference

740
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:43,230
[Applause]

741
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,600
if there are any questions we have

742
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,899
special roadblocks

743
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,620
hats

744
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,539
infoblogs

745
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,320
my bad

746
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,539
um so hi on your right I guess yeah

747
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,299
um you talked about basically command

748
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:12,360
and control servers using thank you

749
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,880
um command and control base yeah servers

750
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,899
using DNS responses as basically extra

751
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,059
information we've got like 32 bits of

752
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,100
info there that you can use as

753
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,520
more data have you seen the same

754
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,399
behavior but using IPv6 responses

755
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,860
considering that you know you just have

756
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,340
a lot more data in there to pass around

757
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,200
yep

758
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,360
so it doesn't matter if it's IPv6 or

759
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,500
ipv4

760
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,020
it's the same the DNS is the same you

761
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,200
have ipv4 Network IPv6 IP address it's

762
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,980
basically 32 versus 128 bits if you have

763
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,480
a name

764
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,299
the same name so it doesn't matter if

765
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:57,600
it's ipv4 or IPv6 IPv6 is actually a

766
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,600
little bit uh maybe a little bit more of

767
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,700
a problem because you have accessible

768
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,559
encoded in budgeting

769
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,980
so yeah but uh for the attacker whatever

770
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,580
works but luckily for us the IPv6 is not

771
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,640
that great use although it's actually

772
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,860
getting more and more uh being used over

773
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,519
Europe but yeah it's uh it doesn't

774
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,760
matter you have a domain name ipv4 IPv6

775
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,320
who cares

776
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,500
so for instance when in your case right

777
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,679
in the case of your company would it

778
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:34,559
would I more IPv6 traffic be a little

779
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,860
bit of a red flag considering that you

780
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,720
know there's

781
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,760
like you have for an end point that's

782
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,220
suddenly requesting a little bit more

783
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,440
IPv6 data than usual would that be let's

784
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,840
say a smallish red flag or is it just

785
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,059
like okay normal traffic will analyze it

786
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,360
as is so you can tackle the problem with

787
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,279
do two different set of files you can

788
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,899
have a look on volume of the traffic

789
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,600
from the endpoint and try to determine

790
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,059
what is normal and what is abnormal but

791
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,099
uh take a look on different web pages

792
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,780
you will click on a link the webpage

793
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,219
will show up and there will be plenty of

794
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,199
ads every single ad might be different

795
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,760
DNS queries so can you say that if your

796
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,379
bunch of your users will click on the

797
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,119
wrong link and with whole lot of ads

798
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,159
that is abnormal or normal

799
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,219
so the volume of the traffic is not the

800
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,800
greatest indicator of course if you have

801
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,839
uh traffic and if you lock the traffic

802
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,639
and look at the traffic on DNS and you

803
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,219
will see a huge amount of MX domain

804
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,679
that is weird why is somebody asking all

805
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,679
all around or how why is many of people

806
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,379
are asking domain that doesn't exist so

807
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,060
most likely you might see maybe data

808
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,580
exploration maybe you will see some

809
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,839
malware that is trying to contact

810
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,659
command and control

811
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,339
the other set of eyes that you will look

812
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,140
at it is basically looking at the

813
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,599
content is it common to have those

814
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,880
characters inside the query like that is

815
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,920
it common to have this the frequency of

816
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,200
the queries towards this destination

817
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,260
like this so it will uh this is why we

818
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,180
have created this algorithm because we

819
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,599
noticed that attackers are hiding this

820
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,000
communication into the into the traffic

821
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,599
that not many companies are looking at

822
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,619
hands up who is logging DNS traffic

823
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,599
you see

824
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,740
we are doing that I think somebody

825
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,960
okay

826
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,460
um I got a question here

827
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,940
um what would you recommend besides

828
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,859
using anti-mile malware on the computer

829
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:47,820
and using some sort of DNS block lists

830
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,339
and my second question is what do you

831
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,440
think about top level domains that still

832
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,460
are that don't implement dnsack

833
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,000
so about the endpoint Solutions we are

834
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,800
not something that will you will just

835
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,480
simply say yeah I don't need endpoint

836
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,320
jump

837
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,540
no you still need endpoint because you

838
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,640
can have malware that will basically do

839
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,980
not use DNS communication right so you

840
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,079
cannot say you you don't need a endpoint

841
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,260
solution but as well I haven't come

842
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,180
across many endpoint solutions that

843
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,280
would be able and capable of detecting

844
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,980
data acceleration or infiltration using

845
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,619
DNS why because they are not focusing at

846
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:26,460
it

847
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,040
because what's wrong if your PC on an

848
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,140
application is asking about some kind of

849
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,020
domain name it might be that the uh that

850
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,240
the programmer have created a mess and

851
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,760
created bad application that is bugging

852
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,440
and asking again and again and again

853
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,780
because it cannot remember the answer or

854
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,300
it might be basically a malware that is

855
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,040
trying to connect multiple control so

856
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,599
determine that

857
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,200
um

858
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,480
and the second question was about the

859
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,200
nsac right

860
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,920
so DNS SEC what is DNS sec it's

861
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,859
cryptographic validation of through

862
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:04,020
information that you are getting back

863
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,520
nothing else

864
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,240
so what you get with DNS SEC is that the

865
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,720
answer you get is true

866
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,220
that's it

867
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,920
so who who is saying that the attacker

868
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,020
might not create the NSA validation on

869
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,300
his authoritative server

870
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,839
so uh in my um in my eyes the NS Tech is

871
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,480
great if you want to mitigate threats

872
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,820
like men in the middle or redirects or

873
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,320
something like that that somebody will

874
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,359
alter the destination IP address that

875
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,520
you are getting but otherwise other than

876
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,119
that uh if everybody will use the NSX 10

877
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,160
is good otherwise sorry

878
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,480
thank you are there any more questions

879
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,760
hi thank you I had a question you

880
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,579
mentioned that the browser should show

881
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,320
by default the

882
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,800
um xn dash dash included string but

883
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,480
where exactly do you see it do you need

884
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,040
to press any key or have any tool

885
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,240
installed

886
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,640
well it depends on the browsers and

887
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,920
version of the browser but I think it's

888
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,320
like default Behavior the threat is that

889
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,240
you will maybe get an email and the

890
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,520
email will display your link and this

891
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,260
link will be displayed

892
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,280
like I saw shown you but uh when you do

893
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,200
you check the links in your emails that

894
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,560
you are getting

895
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,800
no worries okay one more question

896
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,460
okay so far we've talked about

897
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,640
analyzing the query requests for any

898
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,700
kind of suspicious data coming through

899
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,220
but what about the if there was an

900
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,240
attack Vector where the attacker

901
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,780
changes the request the response of the

902
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,119
query

903
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,300
for example in a scenario where he wants

904
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,000
to deliver more malicious payroll to the

905
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,380
compromised

906
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,240
instance

907
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,480
so you analyze this is hard for me to

908
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,099
understand the question is basically

909
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:10,260
does can we alter the sound because it's

910
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,240
like

911
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,020
and I it's a hard time to hearing it

912
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,140
my question is do you do analysis on the

913
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,740
query responses as well yes we we are

914
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,920
checking uh the queries itself and as

915
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,020
well responses because sometimes you

916
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,960
cannot block off for example phishing uh

917
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,420
based on DNS name because the attacker

918
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,180
can generate the DNS name on the Fly

919
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,560
there are Registries that will allow you

920
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,000
to do this basically variables so you

921
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,740
are looking at the responses so if you

922
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,599
see that a bunch of IP addresses is

923
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,460
still the same whatever query you have

924
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,380
you can block that

925
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,180
yes thank you

926
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,240
okay one last last question I promise

927
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,800
yeah go on yeah gone so could this be

928
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,760
evaded by using the short urls

929
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,240
so the detection so if you use the short

930
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,940
URL service

931
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,060
so what height yeah so what is the short

932
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,060
URL the short URL is just easier for us

933
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,420
in in the background it will definitely

934
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,640
do DNS queries a bunch of them with a

935
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,320
bunch of redirects so uh with that is a

936
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,420
bunch of DNS queries so for me it

937
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,320
doesn't matter

938
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,859
it's DNS I'm on DNS level traffic DNS

939
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,619
traffic so I'm on DNS level so wherever

940
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,420
you want to connect you need an IP

941
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,220
address

942
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,980
so if if there is some kind of uh

943
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,160
shorter URL that will be responded to

944
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,700
because so something that would convert

945
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,280
commands

946
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,920
so I have the short URL with a very

947
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,579
short for example cryptic non-human

948
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,240
string right and that one could be

949
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,099
transformed in something much more

950
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,320
understandable by the malware by the

951
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,700
server

952
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,200
and Dancer will come back so the you

953
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,740
said that DNS resolution will be

954
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,240
um

955
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,760
repeated so first you have a short term

956
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,200
at all I I have an answer but then again

957
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,619
so basically it uh for me in the short

958
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,920
URL is uh on what level we are on a

959
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,140
level of browser so the browser will try

960
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,180
to determine what the what the URL means

961
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,400
so it will get the domain it will try to

962
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,220
resolve the domain

963
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,380
yeah so it doesn't matter for me it's on

964
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,700
the DNS level

965
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,400
you are getting queries to the domains

966
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,320
and you are providing IP addresses to

967
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,119
connect to yeah yeah okay okay and

968
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,579
any false positives because I notice

969
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,579
there are a lot of cloud services yes so

970
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,119
you have the string in front of the

971
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:02,040
so the first positive is good question

972
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,500
because as I show you the entropy it's a

973
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,420
prompt to have false positive rate quite

974
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,940
high so that's why we are doing all

975
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,280
these other analysis I haven't shown you

976
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,500
like frequency size Gene indexes

977
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,660
classification errors number of labels

978
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,359
all of those are things that we do check

979
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,760
with every single query because we don't

980
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,280
want to have those false positive my

981
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,079
experience with the for example

982
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,880
financial sector that are using our

983
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,220
algorithms is that they report me back

984
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,260
that they have like five to six post

985
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,180
positive per month

986
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,520
and I don't think that five to six volts

987
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,800
positive per month is speaking out

988
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,540
it's definitely not a 100 per second

989
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,520
yep is it uh okay question yeah answer

990
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,920
sorry okay thank you thank you so much

991
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,280
