1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,559
hi everybody

2
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,639
so

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,859
let's imagine for a moment

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,019
that your country was a attacked at 4 00

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,139
am

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,840
maybe you're some

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,879
explosions near to the building

8
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,440
and trying to leave country

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,700
but

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,879
you have low gas fuel in your car

11
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,940
you can't you can't use your bank

12
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,520
accounts and

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,140
use any

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,000
transportations

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,519
city transportation bus stations Metro

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,680
stations train stations

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,240
because they are under

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,420
Cyber attack

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,020
pepperoni

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,740
so I guess

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,500
he will defend yourself and tell

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,860
apartment

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,180
but how

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,500
you will defend yourself and help Army

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,420
let's talk about

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,500
how we all can be helpful in such

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,900
situations

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,979
maybe this word that is Army is kinda

29
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,700
old-fashioned

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,579
not so Technical and other stuff but

31
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,560
there are some

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,780
properties

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,560
for the actions that you will do you

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,520
will

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,659
have some repeatable actions

36
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,940
they could be scaled by doing this more

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,099
and more every day

38
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,680
they will contain some hardcore skills

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,700
that will require to accomplish them and

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,180
it's good to be trained from zero from

41
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,160
the from the training

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,640
to some sort of lower medium level very

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,680
fast and it could be turning on some

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,780
polygons so you can

45
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,560
involve your friends relatives Brothers

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,720
sister and

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,280
everybody you're familiar with

48
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,860
and we talk not about we are not talking

49
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,519
about like a str5 the doors or subnet

50
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,000
patrolling or like cyber bullying it's

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,860
uh

52
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,700
such activities were made by a lot of

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,580
people in the first I don't know a week

54
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,400
or maybe months because they just want

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,480
to be

56
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,540
be involved and participate actively but

57
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,780
they don't really have seen any plan to

58
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,239
do or any

59
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,760
um maybe even expertise to do

60
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,540
and they just try to do something maybe

61
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,980
healthy

62
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,760
and sometimes it looks not so effective

63
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,879
so we need to start from the point that

64
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,959
cyber actions are not affecting real

65
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,340
world

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,760
you are sitting in in front of computer

67
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,940
and some guy shooting

68
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,640
your my little

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,420
close Neighbors

70
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,980
in real world

71
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,840
but

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,000
people used to cyber processes and they

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,459
rely on them and the real world depends

74
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,440
on Sunday

75
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,019
so we can influence

76
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,599
to real world by cyber

77
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,200
and we have some challenges

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
so we need to

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,418
organize some group

80
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,880
have some capabilities to do so every

81
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,259
member of group can do some stuff

82
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,100
and not just imagine that he will do he

83
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,400
must have experience

84
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,160
you need to integrate your group with

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,919
your authorities

86
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,100
and

87
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,120
coordinating actions so

88
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,138
how it looks on the practice

89
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,240
without any professional experience and

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,639
especially a Warfare experience

91
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,800
a lot of people just trying to

92
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,960
connect some security guys or hacker

93
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,020
guys and say hey help me

94
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,800
I need to hack email or like I need to

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,000
hack some websites

96
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,880
and this this first thought

97
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,960
that people want to

98
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,300
achieve with the help of you

99
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,620
so

100
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,500
the next when you're trying to crack

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,580
something

102
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,520
brain hit and show them to them that

103
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,419
okay I got you I I got your access

104
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,220
have a look

105
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,590
and

106
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:48,720
[Music]

107
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,340
um

108
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,120
you know nothing interesting in inbox

109
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,600
or there are a lot of documents there

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,759
are a lot of

111
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,160
data that are not really

112
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,860
answering any question it's like garbage

113
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,620
you know it's like

114
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,460
um just some just I'm looking to the

115
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,160
data and then configure anything

116
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,380
you need to spend a lot of times through

117
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,500
searching and the data be familiar with

118
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,020
it read it and analyze

119
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,759
so after some time of doing this useless

120
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,060
job

121
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,120
uh you will

122
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,500
face with another level of

123
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,479
goal so

124
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,580
everybody gaining experience in this

125
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,520
field they're trying to

126
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
have

127
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,180
thoughtful experience they're trying to

128
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,120
have some interesting facts like

129
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,740
trying to make cyber works for our men

130
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,600
and next step

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,259
next level of the goal setting is you

132
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,680
need just additional information to

133
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,139
informations that we have already so

134
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,180
find us

135
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,580
information about

136
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,080
X or Y no let's find the equipment find

137
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
people find something that we are

138
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,860
looking for

139
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,080
and there is a

140
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,020
much bigger Gap so you can know where

141
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,780
you can find it you can break emails you

142
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,460
can hack website but

143
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,080
you're not sure that you'll find this

144
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,819
information

145
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,199
what

146
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,979
it's evolution of thought

147
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,360
you're trying to build something and

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,940
the complexity of this activity is grow

149
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,560
up

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
is

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,819
we need situational information in

152
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,020
no word where and how

153
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,139
it's more specific goals so you can

154
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,020
measure it you can drive or

155
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,360
bring some

156
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,840
specific result to this goal so you can

157
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,460
achieve success

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,060
next is uh you'll be asked for some

159
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,340
valuable insights so

160
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,280
not hug something not some information

161
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,419
just give us

162
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,379
Give us new insights that we can

163
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,080
have and then we can do some actions

164
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,779
that will bring us forward

165
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,380
so it's very complex level of this of

166
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,659
this goal settings but

167
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,580
I will tell more about its next slides

168
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,000
and the five is like the top

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,839
uh top level of this

170
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,820
it means that you find some information

171
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,940
and this information is used to make

172
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,860
some decision

173
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,660
that will grow up your

174
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,279
confidence that this decision is right

175
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,600
decision that you can make

176
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,779
it's a very rare situation that the

177
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,200
this goal will be accomplished like in

178
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,060
one task that you

179
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,339
set this goal and one person will

180
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,160
accomplish this that he's practically

181
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,939
impossible

182
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,080
so

183
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,459
so let's close to the Cyber operations

184
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:35,279
be close to cyberporation so the first

185
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,399
what's the technical guy look

186
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,640
what his side what what's happening on

187
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,660
his side

188
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,220
so his evolution is

189
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,959
presented on this line the first thing

190
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,560
that he can do is those some website

191
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,580
like hostname

192
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,200
ATC but it's not

193
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,959
the second is the first month maybe

194
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,760
you're familiar with

195
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,580
some Middle East

196
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,080
armies

197
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,839
like presenters or like of other

198
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
entities they are the face

199
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,380
of a lot of workers websites and put

200
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,580
their music and logo on your website

201
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,920
maybe you have some experience like this

202
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,800
some years ago it was like 10 or five

203
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,240
years ago or less

204
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,800
so the first one this is pretty

205
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,740
easy maybe easy and

206
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,920
scalable operations that every hacker

207
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,860
can do

208
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,899
later on we will talk about the effort

209
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,640
and what the result of this operation

210
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
and why you need to do this and why you

211
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,959
don't need to do this

212
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,220
short grade of operations it's a data

213
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,640
leak and or Vibe so you can put a Viper

214
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,620
on the network

215
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,120
it's almost the same but

216
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,579
in the wiper case you just grab the

217
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,260
information

218
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,300
the first three

219
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,459
so it's more complex separation you need

220
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,980
to have access to network

221
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,079
you know like the same I will not talk

222
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,060
over those things

223
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,600
the fourth grade is

224
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,180
um

225
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,800
it's one of the options that you can do

226
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,440
you can do with the data that was leaked

227
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,220
previously

228
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,440
so

229
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,500
let's talk about psyops because the

230
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,040
phasement and those it's not interesting

231
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,200
so it's a brief

232
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,380
protocol of how you can make it

233
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,339
like how is done usually

234
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,360
so

235
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,540
as you can see there are some

236
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,600
expertise required that are not related

237
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,180
to cyber security and it's a related

238
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,420
model for some marketing stuff and

239
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,339
uh other PR activities

240
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,820
I can mention only uh for the search

241
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,760
bullets that

242
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,700
it's good to clock your publication for

243
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,880
example if you have some media web show

244
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,420
so admin administration of this website

245
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,079
will not notice that

246
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,620
these information in the first hour at

247
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,700
least

248
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,279
and you will have time to spread this

249
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,800
information

250
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,540
and

251
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,760
gain some

252
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,959
results from it

253
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,579
we will quickly go through the website

254
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,720
Ops and

255
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,779
dive into the more interesting operation

256
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,139
so setups it's basically is two types

257
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,800
offensive and defensive

258
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,820
first type

259
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,579
could be targeted it's basically

260
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,779
efficient

261
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,620
or some sort of deception that is

262
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,200
targeted for one person

263
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,700
and the mass media it's

264
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,139
requires more expertise

265
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,519
and defensive is some sort of just

266
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,800
communication with the in mass media for

267
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,500
their people who is not familiar with

268
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,040
such

269
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,200
attacks

270
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
so

271
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
targeted

272
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,000
for example targeted is a we call it

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,279
serum for fission maybe you're familiar

274
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,920
with some efficient Frameworks like

275
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,060
goldfish

276
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,240
or like I know maybe some social

277
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,220
engineer toolkit

278
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,959
and others they are dedicated to one

279
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,240
of like two channels

280
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,760
Syrian CRM is a

281
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,740
terminology from the marketing where you

282
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,360
have client base

283
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,100
and you're selling something to your

284
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,160
clan base so basically we are selling

285
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,940
this section for our client base

286
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,779
it contains

287
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,779
every person profile and the

288
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,880
communication channels that we can

289
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,920
communicate with him

290
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,120
and push some misinformation to his

291
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,420
decision making mind

292
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,000
so

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,779
some civilians could be very interesting

294
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,959
and helpful in this scenario is Franco

295
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,579
actors

296
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,760
also fellow fake call centers they have

297
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,160
a huge experience in this field

298
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,959
and whatever psychology

299
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,480
I will not dive deep in this but you can

300
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,560
figure out yourself

301
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,820
so

302
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,300
uh the workload was about cyborgs it was

303
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,459
briefly and it's

304
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,940
the problem about cyops is you can't

305
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,300
really measure the resultness or like

306
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,300
efficiency of these operations you can

307
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,899
do some projects some activities

308
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,839
maybe count some likes reports I don't

309
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,519
know but

310
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,339
you can't

311
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,600
measure what people think about

312
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,300
your product or your activity so what

313
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,480
thoughts you placed in their mind

314
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,480
you can do fall on the streets you can

315
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,000
ask them what you think about our

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,260
government or what you think about ours

317
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,380
and other people and you have no

318
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,839
feedback

319
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,100
so that's why there are another call

320
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,720
that is more interesting

321
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,320
as I call it cicd in data lake so it's

322
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,500
continuous process

323
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,720
in

324
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,500
gathering and achieving the Italians

325
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,420
so

326
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,240
briefly it's you need to have initial

327
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,079
access

328
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,300
make exfiltration

329
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,660
make extraction of your exfiltrated data

330
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,180
make some analysis of this data and

331
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,880
bring insights

332
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,500
we will

333
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,820
deep dive in every of this bullet

334
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,320
so

335
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,600
for initial access you need penetration

336
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,380
team

337
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,579
the instruction team you can divide this

338
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,919
subject to three

339
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,280
sections first section is the initial

340
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,020
access pen tester

341
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,280
so it's a guy who can bring OLED

342
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,319
subcontractor or like

343
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,959
freelancer

344
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,280
you

345
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,980
are willing to organize your workflow as

346
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,140
you wish

347
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,600
and he'll bring accesses

348
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,059
so second

349
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,120
sector of penetration team is lateral

350
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,600
mover it's a guy who basically work with

351
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,299
his initial accesses and

352
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,660
trying to borrow inside these networks

353
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,700
he can trap into one network and borrow

354
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,720
to the second sword and force Network

355
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,940
that has no internet

356
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,100
and no any other ways to get inside

357
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,500
except the first

358
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,900
staged Network

359
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,940
that has accidentally some

360
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,400
misconfiguration

361
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,220
so and the third one guy is a data

362
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,799
engineer exfiltrator it's a guy who can

363
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
who can operate inside Network in some

364
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,520
cases it's very valuable and have a lot

365
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,000
of minions

366
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,500
so let's

367
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,600
talk about everyone in details a bit so

368
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,780
initial access been tested it's in our

369
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,120
conditions it's

370
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,660
has no a lot not a lot of grades

371
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,660
the first one great is the grade that

372
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,580
you can start from

373
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,640
and it's pretty understandable the

374
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,220
second and third grade it's

375
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,620
hardcore grades

376
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,860
you can just start from them

377
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,419
because you have you need to have some

378
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,000
time for research you need some time for

379
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,120
for

380
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,900
make yourself calm and have thoughts

381
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,140
only about your assumption

382
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,440
in some cases it's very hard to do and

383
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,880
manage

384
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,559
so

385
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,600
lateral

386
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,860
move the guy who basically

387
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,100
no operation systems and how to

388
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,919
administrate them

389
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,260
and

390
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,660
some security hints he need to

391
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,299
accomplish his AV bypass privilege

392
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,280
escalation and

393
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,000
the

394
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,220
the best one side is his finished job

395
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,580
it's put some sort of

396
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,140
rootkit maybe or like some simple after

397
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:16,440
run agent to have shell to network

398
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,980
in some cases

399
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,039
during during you moving of some Network

400
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,380
you will see some software that you

401
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,940
can't understand you need to read

402
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,660
documentation into the manuals this

403
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,000
software could be related only for some

404
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,220
specific

405
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,140
country or geography specific language

406
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,640
so

407
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,100
this

408
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,000
this bullet also

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,520
requires some Outsourcing or some

410
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,140
foreign expertise that you need to

411
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,520
involve

412
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,640
because it's pretty impossible to gather

413
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,380
all kind of

414
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,799
penetration test Engineers who can

415
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,640
administrate and do all this on any kind

416
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,799
of network it's a little bit I don't

417
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,860
know like 100 people like 200 people 300

418
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,740
people and they will have very

419
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,299
variance

420
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:18,059
sin like small

421
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,059
expertise

422
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,740
so and data engineer is basically he

423
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,740
very well it's a very valuable person in

424
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,860
some kind of networks that has EDR or

425
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,120
like cm

426
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,980
that

427
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,880
has some human resources

428
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,299
uh dedicated to monetary activity

429
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,120
Network like to find some fraud

430
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,460
activities to find some unusual

431
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,760
activities so you need to pick some data

432
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,520
that will be valuable to extract

433
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,880
and it's impossible to instruct all the

434
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,940
data from Network so that Engineers need

435
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,419
to know what his main focus and what he

436
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,700
is looking for

437
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,600
so it's not uh completely like fully

438
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,379
technical there

439
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,780
so and what's the result of this

440
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,600
workflow

441
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,940
end result you will get

442
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,039
so you will convert some initial

443
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,460
accesses to data sources

444
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,679
you will have that instruction and you

445
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,220
will have

446
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,120
humid

447
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,100
to image

448
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,620
as a result

449
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,320
so sources could be static clicks you

450
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,539
can use static links that was

451
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,020
leaked by Anonymous or like other groups

452
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,600
it will be valuable to

453
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,360
they don't want to lick everything it's

454
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,059
not easy to find

455
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,559
very good and

456
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,580
very like

457
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,000
totally with a lot of documents

458
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,600
it's basically mostly passwords logins

459
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,179
phone numbers and other stuff

460
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:17,419
right it's good for hu MIT

461
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,120
so real-time exfiltration it's a

462
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,159
continuous data League that you will

463
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,000
have with your initial access and some

464
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,159
like the rootkit or other software

465
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,220
so what is data extract

466
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,659
when you

467
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,120
gather some information or have data

468
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,659
leak or maybe made some exfiltration

469
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:46,679
you need to convert this data to

470
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,640
valuable and readable data by

471
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,159
not a lot of

472
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,400
stuff not not a lot of people so you can

473
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
you need to build economy

474
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,760
of

475
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,400
human resource because

476
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,179
you can read like 10 people like 20

477
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,539
people can read one terabyte

478
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,659
of data league for like months

479
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:18,740
and find nothing

480
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,419
so you need to extra access that data

481
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,299
add two plain texts

482
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,620
so you will take PDF documents doc X

483
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,080
documents presentation any kind of

484
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,820
pictures photos

485
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,159
and

486
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,820
find all texts from them you can use a

487
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,860
lot of tools that will help you

488
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,640
next

489
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,460
you will have plain text extracted from

490
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,559
data League

491
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,179
you have three bullies that you need to

492
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:55,380
set up

493
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,440
first one is if you need to keywords and

494
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,840
we are alerted with these keywords

495
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,020
so you will be

496
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,100
like first gate of decision making

497
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,860
uh person

498
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,440
second it's a you need to classificate

499
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,419
your documents you need to know for sure

500
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,260
where uh documents and what types of

501
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,900
documents it could be like some

502
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,299
certificates it could be some invoices

503
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,460
it could be some

504
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,919
technical specifications it would be

505
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:29,880
just

506
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,460
I don't know

507
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,299
like many kind of

508
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,340
documental

509
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,020
communication between

510
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,360
some sort of organization or entities it

511
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,779
could be anything there are like 40 or

512
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,900
like 50 type of documents that we

513
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,100
haven't released today

514
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,140
so and every data League will have

515
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,279
summarize of type of documents

516
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,460
as that it contains so for example like

517
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,760
this the topic contains 100 invoices

518
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,580
50 technical documentation

519
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,039
and

520
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,200
some summary or abstracts of the long

521
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,440
version documents you need to have short

522
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,159
abstraction so you can use NLP for

523
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,740
natural language processing and

524
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,260
summarize these documents

525
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,520
it's

526
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,279
a pretty big

527
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,659
like it's

528
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,860
not small software that will

529
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,380
um

530
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,880
recycle data to some more human related

531
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,260
and human readable formats for you

532
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,279
it contains it could be contained by

533
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,200
some machine learning

534
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,600
so for example for document

535
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,720
classification you can have two methods

536
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,679
you can save documents into images

537
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,940
and teach Machine by learning on these

538
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,299
on these images by the form of this

539
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,620
document

540
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,640
and you can extract text and process

541
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,919
this language naturally

542
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,460
by Machine learning and

543
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,539
teach machine to operate which type of

544
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:32,340
document have some sort of keywords

545
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,260
so

546
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,840
summary abstract is also could contain

547
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,000
some machine learning all these software

548
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,659
is commonly used it's not not an

549
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:45,860
innovation for today

550
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,760
so and what is

551
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,919
h-u-m-i-t MNT

552
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,840
you might be familiar with the scene

553
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,940
Frameworks but I never

554
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,940
actually saw a lot of

555
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,980
uh

556
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,159
hu and

557
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,980
Frameworks but there are some

558
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,380
the key with this is to have every type

559
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,140
of connection between some entities or

560
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,820
like persons

561
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,779
and if you have some documents that are

562
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,299
wrote brightened by one person to

563
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,700
another person you need to have this on

564
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,320
this graph

565
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,640
and this graph will describe these two

566
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,000
persons have a docum have a document

567
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,400
between them

568
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,059
that is classified as invoice

569
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,460
and that is

570
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,240
have some summary about

571
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,700
and this graph could

572
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,640
summarize this activity and give a full

573
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,640
picture of any kind of data Lake

574
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,299
compilation

575
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,179
so the key points of this framework is

576
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,200
extract personal data from data Lake

577
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,500
it's a date of birth names

578
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,080
it's a some

579
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,980
phone numbers passwords and other stuff

580
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,100
and connections as I said and you need

581
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,678
to have context of these connections

582
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,520
so

583
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:35,600
it's the previous slides that talk about

584
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,279
sounds very

585
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,760
smart

586
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,480
but you need to build it from the

587
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,580
scratch

588
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,240
and you need to teach people

589
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,419
to work with it

590
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,480
and you have a lot of problems

591
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,799
and science

592
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,460
February

593
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,020
it was past eight or nine months

594
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,860
and we still have

595
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,240
not

596
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,419
draw this animal

597
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:18,799
be somewhere in the middle

598
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,740
why

599
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,299
no no

600
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,899
everybody

601
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,559
can forget View and must forget about

602
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,539
first

603
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,520
second

604
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,840
and maybe even short bullet and focus on

605
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,880
the force

606
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,500
but to go through this

607
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,440
you need to have some evolutionary

608
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,320
process in your mind working with the

609
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,840
data especially it's hard for

610
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,320
people who not familiar with

611
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,600
informational Technologies who is not

612
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,779
working with computers

613
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,140
and as you know

614
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:22,039
Army has very old computers

615
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,899
and

616
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:34,620
how you can ignite this process

617
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,980
you have two ways one way

618
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,679
it's a matter of your life and secondly

619
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,299
you have a cyber polynomial

620
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,460
where teachers and students can teach

621
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,700
have this and operate this workflows

622
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,440
in realistic environments

623
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,640
there are some cyber polygons already

624
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,419
announced

625
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,659
operating

626
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:10,140
and maybe an open sourced

627
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,279
but it's all about people behind this

628
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,440
not

629
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,279
software

630
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,820
in some cases

631
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,860
no in every cases you will have a

632
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,860
big needs to Outsource this because you

633
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,140
will have no expertise

634
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,980
no expertise for to made full circle

635
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,179
it's

636
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,679
possible

637
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,760
and there are a lack of trust lack of

638
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,399
confidence I know there are a lot of

639
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,279
risks

640
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,320
and

641
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,840
actually there are no

642
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,279
proven methods of Outsourcing the parts

643
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,539
of cyber operations

644
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,940
when the contractor has only his

645
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,820
specific part of job and he can have

646
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,820
access to any other parts of the

647
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,539
projects

648
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,179
but it's a challenge that I think soon

649
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,440
will be

650
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,279
solved

651
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,140
thank you for attention

652
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,760
all right do we have any questions

653
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,019
thanks for your presentation

654
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,600
when you are talking about Outsourcing

655
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,380
your resource you are talking about the

656
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,200
mediatory reserve or you are talking

657
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,460
about Prevail company

658
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,940
this presentation is based on

659
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,480
experience and observance

660
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,099
absorbent what is going around

661
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,899
myself

662
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,359
so

663
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,098
I have no like

664
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:24,319
can you rephrase your question

665
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,020
sorry when I talking about military

666
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,199
Reserve maybe it's not the good world I

667
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,580
talking about

668
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,199
um

669
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,839
Romanian people civil who support us for

670
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:42,179
the military uh but you know uh like uh

671
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:45,659
subcontractor but they are volunteer for

672
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:47,040
for that

673
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,199
yeah it's also it's a way to

674
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,699
collaborate or communicate or exchange

675
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,760
experience

676
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,339
and I will be glad to any sort of

677
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:05,760
expertise that could be donated or like

678
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,200
sold

679
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,520
or

680
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,680
another way like another form of

681
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,300
collaboration

682
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,240
could help us both

683
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,280
all right if we don't have any other

684
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,700
questions give it up for Vladimir

685
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,500
thank you

686
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,989
[Applause]
