1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
hello hello so do you hear me well

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,240
okay if there are some problems please

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,899
let me know

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,820
so

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,980
most of you I think know me but who

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,600
doesn't know me I will introduce myself

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,060
quickly I am Maxim yawitch from

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,460
Georgette bilisi the president of

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,160
scientific cyber security Association

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,279
also we were close to we must go very

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,940
closely with Dev camp we have we are the

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,160
representatives of cybered at our

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,260
association at our University coaches

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,980
University we teach according cyberedo

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,919
programa so as you can see here

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,980
like ccs

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,579
here is scientific cyber security

18
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,820
Association nearby there is a logo of

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,920
caucus University and kokosi cyber

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,420
security Center

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,240
so let's begin

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,798
I tried one no

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,820
okay thank you

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,939
okay so today I want to talk to you

25
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,520
about the model of post Quantum

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,159
signature scheme using the workload tree

27
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,240
so why it is very interesting work

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,860
letter is a very very new technology and

29
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,720
this is the first time where I offer the

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,780
schema and the scheme like this is not

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,900
offered yet in practice and I hope I

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,460
hope that it can be the real

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,360
breakthrough in post-quantum science so

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
I want to give you the quick background

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,299
of cryptography of the topics which we

36
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,780
need to understand my Approach and after

37
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,000
what we'll concretely describe the

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
approach so usually in cryptography we

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,299
have two Heroes Alice and Bob

40
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,420
they usually share the key between each

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,600
other

42
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,099
and of course they have the message

43
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,500
which you must be encrypted

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,080
so they encrypt the message

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
by means of some encryption algorithm

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,540
which accepts the message and the key

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,520
and to decrypt the message they have the

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,739
decryption algorithm and they decrypt it

49
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,660
with the same key this is the approach

50
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,420
of symmetric cryptography

51
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,420
here is Mr hacker which tries to

52
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,700
intercept the message maybe he can

53
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,160
intercept but he cannot understand what

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,379
is written there he cannot decrypt it

55
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,500
the only the only important thing is

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,560
that to decrypt the message that when we

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,360
decrypting are decrypting the methods

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,400
the decrypting the encrypted message by

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,099
the same key we must get our message

60
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,660
back

61
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,739
Okay so

62
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:03,239
let us talk about private private key

63
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,459
cryptography so-called symmetry

64
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,519
cryptography here two users have already

65
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,040
the secret key shared between each other

66
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,940
and they need they need to share some

67
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,860
secret message between each other yes

68
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,140
somehow to encrypt it by means of this

69
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,819
key

70
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,340
what is the problem there the problem is

71
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,980
key distribution problem so the question

72
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,400
is how these users how this user shares

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,980
the key between each other so

74
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,500
they need some kind of secure Channel

75
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,680
one approach to solve this problem is

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,780
the physical proximity they have to see

77
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,400
each other and somehow pass the key yes

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,150
so it is not a good approach

79
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,180
[Music]

80
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,819
for example let's assume image imagine

81
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,280
the organization which has a lot of

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,860
employees in this case and my n

83
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,680
employees and all of them have to

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,580
communicate securely so they must have n

85
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,599
minus one key for each to go to

86
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
communicate with other and minus one

87
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,819
employees so in the whole organization

88
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,579
they need case quiz the complexity of

89
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,798
k-squared keys can you imagine for the

90
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,800
organizations like Microsoft and so on

91
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,199
how complicated it is to store so many

92
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,620
keys

93
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,919
so if the users didn't have didn't have

94
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,660
the prior relationship it's very

95
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,699
difficult it's very difficult for them

96
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,120
to share the keys so can you imagine for

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
example the customer setting a credit

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,120
card information yes to his Merchant to

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,060
Amazon to eBay or something like this or

100
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,100
when you are sending the email to the

101
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,180
colleague how can you share the key so

102
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,940
there is no yes a chance

103
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,639
here the classical cryptography is a

104
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,620
symmetric one doesn't go it doesn't

105
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,680
offer us any solutions so here we switch

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,740
we switch to asymmetric cryptography and

107
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,460
here the heroes of the Revolution

108
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,740
defiant Hellman some of you have heard

109
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,080
about DV Hellman diffie-hellman

110
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,900
encryption of our diffie-hellman key

111
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,540
distribution mechanism maybe you can

112
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,759
think that diffuse the name and hellmann

113
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,180
is a second name no as you can see here

114
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,039
is one guy and here is another guy

115
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,860
so they have created a new Direction

116
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,560
so-called asymmetric cryptography what

117
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,060
does it mean asymmetric cryptography and

118
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,039
what it is based first of all there is a

119
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,800
symmetry we have there two keys one for

120
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,139
encryption another one for decryption

121
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,979
and it is based on the fact that there

122
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,979
are some uh there are some tasks that is

123
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,620
easy and easy to solve them but it is

124
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,440
complicated to reverse them so we

125
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,479
encrypt with that once which is easy and

126
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,139
to decrypt it it must be complicated

127
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,460
so here let us look how key exchange

128
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,580
works when I saw it the first time it

129
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,440
seemed to me some kind of magic let us

130
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,020
discuss it so here Bob and delis are

131
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,639
communicating Bobby saying something

132
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,340
else is answering something and Mr

133
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,800
hacker that guy that we saw before yes

134
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,360
is eavesdropping and finally Bob and

135
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,300
delis both of them have the key and the

136
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,660
hacker doesn't have any idea about the

137
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,900
key so he was he was looking at the kid

138
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,479
he was looking at the communication but

139
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,060
both of them to have the kid but the

140
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,180
hacker doesn't have so after what they

141
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,919
can encrypt their message by means of

142
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,660
this scheme

143
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,240
so more formally Bob is sending

144
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,580
something else is sending something back

145
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,580
and we go we get the transcript and the

146
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,340
security goal that even when a hacker is

147
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,620
looking at right script he cannot he

148
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,139
cannot get the message

149
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,220
so here finally they have the key and

150
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,180
afterwards they can encrypt their

151
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,460
message so let us talk about

152
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,300
diffie-hellman key exchange so it is

153
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,180
based it is based on logarithmical

154
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,300
problem first of all but concretely it's

155
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,520
based on ddh problem so decisional

156
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,919
difficult problem it's more complicated

157
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,139
problem then discrete logarith problem

158
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,419
and

159
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,900
hear how it works so Mr Bob you can see

160
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,819
Mr Bob here he he has g capital G is a

161
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,280
group little G the generator Q is the

162
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,560
size the order of the group and he

163
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,139
chooses some random X

164
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,440
he takes the generator into X power and

165
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,680
sets sends it to Alice so as you can see

166
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,780
this everything

167
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,900
this is everything is also seen to the

168
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,039
hacker

169
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,720
now Alice

170
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,280
has

171
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,539
H1 she generates some y

172
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,860
also random y

173
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,240
here it is

174
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,979
and races raises the generator into

175
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,919
raise the generator into this y so now

176
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,160
Bob has G to the x l is has G to the Y

177
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,840
and a hacker cisbos what is this

178
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,300
collaborate problem if you know Jin if

179
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,760
you know G to the X you cannot get X

180
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,219
from there so

181
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,779
here

182
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,419
what they do

183
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,700
Bob has having H1 with G to them why he

184
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,980
takes it to the power of X and get to

185
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,200
get G to the Y X and L is takes her H1

186
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,140
takes into the power of Y and gets G to

187
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,100
the X Y power look both both

188
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,779
informations are identical so they have

189
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,380
shared the key but hacker cannot cannot

190
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,120
understand

191
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,240
what is the skill so here is the idea of

192
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,940
public encryption Mrs Ellis to generate

193
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,220
public and secret care she uploads the

194
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,740
public it was a repository when Bobs

195
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,080
want to encrypt the message he goes to

196
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,019
repository and by means of this public

197
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,540
here he can encrypt the message so

198
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,940
encryption is being occurred by means of

199
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,000
public here to decrypt the message Alice

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,300
goes Alice has a secret key and decrypts

201
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,459
a message by means of the secret care so

202
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,620
everybody everybody can encrypt a

203
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,019
message but only a list can decrypt it

204
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,680
because she has a secret key

205
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,760
let us look at elgamal encryption

206
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,800
so here we have Bob has G to the x

207
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,160
the public key is the group the order of

208
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,399
the group the generator at H1

209
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,620
L is get G to the Y

210
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,620
now

211
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,500
here is a message the encrypted message

212
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,580
h21 and H1 to the in the power of Y

213
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,760
multiplied by m here it is

214
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,080
ah how do you do that so here

215
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,800
the first part is c0 and then the second

216
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,660
part is C1

217
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,700
now

218
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,240
you can see in that K is H2 of course to

219
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,279
the power of X as in the previous slide

220
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,920
and the message is C2 the second part

221
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,240
divided by C1 divided by the key so here

222
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,360
is here is a gamble encryption so we

223
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,660
generate all the public parameters

224
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,279
afterwards

225
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,399
we generate the ciphers C1 and C2 and to

226
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,920
decrypt the cipher we divide C2 by the

227
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,860
by C1 into power of X why I cover all

228
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,480
these Primitives because this we will

229
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,720
need in our novel approach okay all this

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,899
is good all this is good but there was

231
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,899
the article as I remember in

232
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,839
2019 when Google signed the contract

233
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,060
with the wave company about creating

234
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,040
quantum computers quantum computer

235
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,560
science cool we think that it is more

236
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,959
fast it's not like this in practice if

237
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,000
you have quantum computer at home and

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,100
try to check email it will not be really

239
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,220
fast but quantum computer can solve the

240
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,800
concrete tasks secondary tasks and for

241
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,899
example it can break all asymmetric

242
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,200
cryptography and it can bake this

243
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,240
Hellman key exchange algorithm it can

244
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,459
break everything I think you have heard

245
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,260
about RSA which is very common in

246
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,519
practice so it can break all all

247
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,500
asymmetric cryptography that exist today

248
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,320
in real life and if you trust me it's

249
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,899
not very pleasant because today we see

250
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,720
that

251
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,399
the wars are being transferred to the

252
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,820
hybrid level so if one government if one

253
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,740
state can get all the secret information

254
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,560
of another state it will be the big

255
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
problem so if one if one country

256
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,680
succeeds to create the real fully

257
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,500
working quantum computer it will be the

258
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,079
real winner of the war so all the

259
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
countries are doing their best to create

260
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,680
quantum computers so in 2019 Google

261
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,279
or has published in nature in nature

262
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,640
Journal very serious news they said that

263
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,279
they have really

264
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,240
received something like Quantum

265
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,160
Supremacy what is quantum Supremacy and

266
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,980
so our today's computers are based on

267
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,200
Newton's physics and quantum computers

268
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
are already based on quantum physics so

269
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,420
they say Quantum supremacies already

270
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,120
when it's based on quantum physics so

271
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,399
they said that they have received

272
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,560
something like Quantum Supremacy they

273
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
compare their results to IBM's

274
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,180
supercomputer and said that their

275
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,959
computer is their computer could make

276
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,839
some concrete task in 200 seconds when

277
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,320
IBM supercomputer called Summit and

278
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,480
glucose computer is called Sycamore so

279
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,720
IBM's supercomputer would need 10 000.

280
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,660
uh years for it and the IBM

281
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,839
supercomputer is a really really big IBM

282
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,480
didn't like this news by the way and

283
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,000
they said that googles try to lie a bit

284
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,660
and their computer doesn't need 10 000

285
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,339
years for it but only only two days and

286
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,660
a half is enough

287
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,820
but come on they are 20 seconds there

288
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,040
today and a half so of course they have

289
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,740
reached something like Quantum Supremacy

290
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,980
and here Google was the first but

291
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,959
we have got the

292
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,200
news from our Chinese colleagues when

293
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,100
they have created the new the new

294
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,260
quantum computer I don't know if I

295
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,820
pronounce it correctly it's called

296
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,100
social

297
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,139
which is 10 million times 10 million

298
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,620
times faster than IBM's supercomputer

299
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,940
and

300
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,839
one million 1 million times faster than

301
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,320
Google's one so they are really real is

302
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,240
the first into this Market they have

303
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,399
also created a quantum computer protocol

304
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,240
2.0 with 113 detected detected photons

305
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
and it must be mentioned that before the

306
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,019
computer could only detect 76 76 photons

307
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,440
okay the scientists are really afraid of

308
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,500
breaking all classical crypto systems so

309
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,720
they are creating on their working

310
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,199
concreation post Quantum alternatives so

311
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,199
uh representatives of them are h-based

312
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,300
digital signature schemes we will talk

313
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,579
about them today code based public

314
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,680
encryption systems

315
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,440
latest based cryptography this year

316
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,540
latest based cryptography and some of

317
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,880
the schemes became the standards the

318
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,100
were standardized pionist and

319
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,740
multivariate public in crypto systems

320
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,199
okay if they exist what is the problem

321
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,420
they are still successful attacks on

322
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,240
them here is the display described the

323
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,820
successful attack on Paterson algorithm

324
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,000
which is called based crypto system so

325
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,540
there was a guy uh Nelly Neil Costigan

326
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,339
together with his professors they have

327
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,560
succeeded to break it afterwards the

328
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,959
researcher said that increase the key

329
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,000
and so on

330
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,940
one more one more uh very important

331
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,660
stuff is efficiency so for today Google

332
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,040
is okay already with classical

333
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,279
cryptography but if cryptography becomes

334
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,620
more harder Google will not be able to

335
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,639
process so many so many processes so

336
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,240
we have to work on efficiency and don't

337
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,459
forget guys about side Channel attacks

338
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,459
when the guys are trying are trying to

339
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,800
measure time to measure power and break

340
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,899
the systems even today we see the

341
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,139
attacks on IES on the receipt time

342
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:05,820
Channel attacks side Channel attacks yes

343
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,699
and the Patterson algorithm mentioned

344
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,920
above has already also the vulnerability

345
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,699
so we must also pay attention on them

346
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:16,560
let's talk about hbase digital signature

347
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,500
schemes they are alternatives of RSA

348
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
signature schemes but they are based on

349
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,459
hash based on hash function which is of

350
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,260
course Collision resistant which has to

351
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,300
be which has to be Collision resistant

352
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,199
so first of all lemford

353
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,639
DCM one-time signature scheme was

354
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,279
offered there we have two to the

355
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,540
signature keys and

356
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,579
afterwards

357
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:46,459
afterwards we have verification keys

358
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,899
they are got from signature keys by

359
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,699
means of applying one-way function to

360
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:51,600
them

361
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,579
and

362
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,740
to sign the signature yes to sign the

363
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,800
signature we

364
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,420
look first of all we haste the message

365
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,880
of course after what we look at the bits

366
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,040
if the first concrete bit is zero we

367
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,140
take the first pair of the key if it is

368
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,540
one we take the second pair

369
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,640
to verify the signature to verify the

370
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,040
signature first of all we calculate the

371
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,380
hash of the message of the cell of the

372
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,540
the hash of the message and afterwards

373
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,059
compare it by means of this formula

374
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,119
so all good but the signature is very

375
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,860
long the signature is very long so

376
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,600
winter needs one time signature scheme

377
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,900
was provided which reduces the signature

378
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,360
schema but one time signature schemes

379
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,059
are always a problem because we need

380
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,940
every key to sign every message yes

381
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,200
mercury has offered the scheme which is

382
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,840
based on binary tree and here it is what

383
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,440
they do down here are

384
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,760
them

385
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,980
verification keys they are hashed we get

386
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,260
these downloads how these upper nodes

387
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,860
are got win concatenate this and this hm

388
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,900
and get this one after that concatenates

389
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,340
this and this and get this one

390
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,919
concatenate this and this and get this

391
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,919
one so this is this one is a public key

392
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,980
and it is used as a public key and if we

393
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,039
begin from this node this one is a

394
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,980
brother node this afterwards this is our

395
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,500
note this one is a browser node and so

396
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,640
on

397
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,460
so of course to sign the message first

398
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,760
of all first of all we make the one-time

399
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,720
signature or Lanford or winternitzwan

400
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,039
afterwards we calculate the public key

401
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,520
and for

402
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,460
for validating the signature first of

403
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,140
all we validate the one-time signature

404
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,299
and afterwards the public key if both

405
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:49,100
are true or good so nothing is new here

406
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,020
Mercury are computationally very fast

407
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,340
they are complexities o2n but

408
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,820
Fair proves the signature is very very

409
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,000
very long and it's the main problem why

410
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,280
is this genius scheme is not used today

411
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,039
in practice and what is very interested

412
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,440
or our group has signed the group of

413
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,880
different scientists were working on

414
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,340
reducing the signature size

415
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,799
always it was a problem we were reducing

416
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,760
it a bit but what I saw what I saw

417
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,220
before before it sorry there also exist

418
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,340
the chi acquire a Mercury and where

419
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,059
we divide look we don't divide all them

420
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,919
into but we can divide them on three on

421
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,200
four and so on so we reduce the height

422
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,539
of the train but we don't reduce the

423
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,299
signature the signature is even even

424
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,780
higher here what is guys our goal our

425
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,720
goal is to reduce hate and to the to

426
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,120
reduce the proof size to reduce the

427
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,820
signature this is our goal and here what

428
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,140
I saw in 2020 or 19 they have created

429
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,100
very interesting very interesting new uh

430
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,960
very interesting new tree called work

431
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
latrine it's very interesting here we

432
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,380
select the branching factor of trillion

433
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,380
and I will show you on the scheme like

434
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,780
this is better so here

435
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,380
for every message we have the

436
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,600
corresponding proof we calculate on

437
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,900
these messages the vector commitment and

438
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,600
also offers a proof of it and I exist

439
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,780
all of them and the public

440
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,520
publicly the root of the trillion is

441
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,380
already Vector commitment con calculated

442
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,059
on these nodes

443
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,200
so here the proof is already much

444
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,020
smaller here you can see and that if we

445
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,419
compare to the Mercury of course the

446
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,900
construction is more complicated but the

447
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,960
proof here is in the Mercury here is

448
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,000
quite a Mercury even bigger and here

449
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,179
anyway guys

450
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,419
we can use

451
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,160
of course it's the proof size is also a

452
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,120
bit bigger but also very very small

453
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,480
so a vector commitment allows us to

454
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,059
commit to an ordered sequel the sequence

455
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,720
of values so we could we could verify

456
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,840
the proof for every for every positioned

457
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,100
element

458
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,400
so here how it works first of all we

459
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,960
generate some public parameters

460
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,080
afterwards we compute Vector commitment

461
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,679
so called CM Vector commitment so called

462
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,900
CN afterwards we calculate all the

463
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,659
proofs and after what we verify will

464
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,640
verify the commitment by means of the

465
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,340
proofs so the most common Vector

466
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,640
commitments are based on CDH what is CDH

467
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,900
is concretely different element

468
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,820
different helmet algorithm what I was

469
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,280
talking about and Vector commitments

470
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,380
based on the resale today I will show

471
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,940
more about CDH so they are based on a

472
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,419
discrete logarith problem

473
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:03,780
you so more to be more concise we cannot

474
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,059
compute the value G to the a squared

475
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,460
when we know G and G to the A

476
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,220
so Vector commitment is that is the

477
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,539
following way we calculate we calculate

478
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:18,720
the vector commitments we calculate C

479
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,620
and we calculate all a hairy CN we

480
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,580
calculate the proofs like this and

481
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,820
afterwards we verify

482
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,240
so in practice usually people use

483
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,100
polynomial commitment because they are

484
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,380
much more easy and they create Vector

485
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,280
commitments from it

486
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,880
so not to calculate everything not to

487
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,460
calculate every not to verify every

488
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,039
commitment they use emerging proofs and

489
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,299
after what proof the pack of commitments

490
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,480
what are the problems guys CDH

491
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,740
is not Quantum secure and all the cool

492
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,220
Vector commitments are based on are

493
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,059
based on cryptography are based on

494
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,580
cryptography which is not which is not

495
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,940
Quantum secure so

496
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,200
what to do with this the idea is to use

497
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,940
the latest based latest based product

498
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,360
for example for example Chris Baker and

499
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,539
the Harry Pepin together with Chad sharp

500
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,840
have offered latest based latest based

501
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,600
proofs which are quantum secure still we

502
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,760
are working to improve them but in any

503
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,260
case they exist

504
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,200
so that in the novel scheme it's like

505
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,600
Mercury scheme the only difference is

506
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,380
that here in the signature I use proofs

507
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,900
commitments instead of this all hashed

508
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,659
browser nodes and it

509
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:56,100
much more much more efficient so the

510
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,799
signature is much much smaller and

511
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,440
instead of the public key I use the root

512
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,500
commitment so we have uh we have

513
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,539
implemented the schema you can see in

514
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,360
Python but only this the first version

515
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,740
based on Biffy Helman so we have created

516
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,100
a CDH Library we import them here we can

517
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,260
calculate the public key and as you can

518
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,900
see it is in the form of dictionary

519
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,880
so because they are proofs Vector

520
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,039
commitment and proofs because we need

521
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,440
key and value and here

522
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,419
we generate the keyn

523
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,080
and

524
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,780
that's it it's very initial initial

525
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,059
offer we don't have them public it's a

526
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,159
third implementation of it's the first

527
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,919
of limitation of cth cth page Vector

528
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,720
commitment and the digital signatures

529
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,940
based on it and we are working to make

530
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,080
it really serious to make it based on

531
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,299
latencies I think maybe on the next

532
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,419
death camp I will already show it

533
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,400
so

534
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,580
many things many thanks to Welcome to

535
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,679
the questions if I have time

536
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,919
I think I succeeded it in exact time

537
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,919
also guys we have scientific application

538
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,080
security Journal which is absolutely

539
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,260
absolutely freeing and each other we

540
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,780
share knowledge with our local public

541
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,659
and if you have some interesting papers

542
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:28,880
welcome to submit so please questions hi

543
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,580
I want to ask you that don't use don't

544
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,779
you use static or symbolic analysis

545
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,159
and

546
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,279
uh no no in this static and symbolic

547
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,380
analysis can be needed only after we

548
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,200
have the final project only after we

549
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,360
have the final project maybe afterwards

550
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,580
to check the code we will use these

551
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,799
techniques thank you

552
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,740
uh hi I wanted to actually to ask

553
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,240
um you said that the quantum computer

554
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,799
will probably not be very good at

555
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,559
checking the email like I said quantum

556
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,140
computer what won't be as good at

557
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,880
checking the email as a physical

558
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,679
computer would be and I wanted to ask

559
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,020
what are the actual tasks that a quantum

560
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,400
computer does better than a physical

561
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
computer like we saw in decrypting but

562
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,039
are there other tests that it would be

563
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,039
good for so usually yes there are two

564
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,779
algorithms there are two algorithms

565
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,559
which quantum computer makes very fast

566
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:30,720
its Shore algorithm and grower algorithm

567
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,840
and when the machine that they are

568
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,820
calling quantum computer will be able to

569
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,419
solve these two may exist acts short and

570
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,460
Global algorithm it will be able to

571
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,760
solve very quickly a lot of a lot of

572
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,360
mathematical problems so concrete

573
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,860
mathematical problems which can be

574
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,580
solved by Shore or grower algorithm it

575
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,360
makes

576
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,380
much faster but also Brute Force brute

577
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,640
force it can speed up Brute Force not

578
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,480
really speed up it will very much but it

579
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,059
can reach the quadratic speed up so if

580
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,779
you need them if you need them

581
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:15,360
uh some number of tries to root for

582
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,159
something there will be in the school

583
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,080
square root from it so it can

584
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,059
quadratically speed up even Brute Force

585
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:28,080
hi hello so thank you again for your

586
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,360
presentation very good I have two

587
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,039
questions the first one you can take it

588
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,840
as a nice breaker you don't need to

589
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,820
answer it but I was interested to know

590
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,279
why we'll hit cryptographers use the Bob

591
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,919
and Alex example Bob and Alice example

592
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,600
so I saw this you know the

593
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,340
cryptographers when they're describing

594
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,659
the principles

595
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,700
that's again a nice breaker you don't

596
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,600
need to answer it and the second

597
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,539
question is I wanted to know your

598
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,520
opinion so us a cyber Security

599
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
Professionals considering we are always

600
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,020
relying on cryptography from hashing

601
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,580
from messages to public key

602
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,279
infrastructure all algorithms and so on

603
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,220
how can we stay one step ahead of the

604
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,559
com con quantum computer Revolution

605
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,200
because again when Quantum quantum

606
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,020
computer evolves all the algorithms

607
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,900
become invalid in a certain time frame

608
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,059
okay thank you let's begin with the

609
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,700
second question so the most interesting

610
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,340
is for example let us talk about hash so

611
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,340
the hashing algorith which is used today

612
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,720
in real life is Chateau sha toon which

613
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,440
is which has a length of 256 so as I

614
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,000
told it's already answered the previous

615
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,220
question

616
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,620
we can break it using the brute force

617
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,320
and in this case quantum computer will

618
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,659
speed up we'll speed the speed up it and

619
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,299
will not be able already to use shot 256

620
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:53,100
we will have also to use sha 512 so we

621
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,799
must double it so for symmetry

622
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,620
cryptography all this is okay asymmetric

623
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,120
cryptography already we have to change

624
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,700
particular cryptography we just make the

625
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,700
key in the key size longer and about the

626
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,559
first question it's I didn't understand

627
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,080
it finally you

628
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,840
you asked why Alice and Bob yes I don't

629
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,659
know because the first book where I was

630
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:17,220
mentioned the cryptography the way Alice

631
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,880
and Bob and also there is a sword hero

632
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,200
Mrs Eva Eve is eavesdroper

633
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,620
hi thank you for your presentation

634
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,039
um after what happened last summer it is

635
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,559
so Jenny everybody knows that sigh was

636
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,620
broken very badly are you not afraid

637
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,720
that something similar might happen to

638
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,760
your constructions

639
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,399
thank you my construction is only the

640
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,260
real initial version it's not

641
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,120
constructed fully it's only the first

642
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,760
ideas I think that these ideas are

643
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,799
already on the interesting level and

644
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,580
then when it is created finally already

645
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,460
already uh I didn't publish the paper

646
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,399
scientific paper according it because I

647
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,840
promise to death camp to be the first

648
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,940
here but afterwards I will publish a

649
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,980
paper first of all it will be checked by

650
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,380
reviewers it will be checked by million

651
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,380
experts by maybe not million but the

652
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,419
cyber security cryptography expert which

653
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,760
exists and maybe they will write some

654
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,279
comments of course we will make the

655
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,039
Crypt analysis of it we will improve it

656
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,980
it's not one or two months process it is

657
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,240
a

658
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,820
rather long process but I still believe

659
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,059
that maybe one day this approach can

660
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:36,960
become the least standard so already why

661
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,720
do why don't we use why don't we use

662
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,840
cryptography we have no we don't have

663
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,480
the right to use a cryptography

664
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,100
implemented by some Maxima which we

665
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,500
don't have right to use it because it

666
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,880
can be broken

667
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,480
it must be checked before using by cyber

668
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,940
Security Experts because of it we have

669
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,700
to use only nist standards so the guys

670
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,159
like me create something after what when

671
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,779
it when we think that it's really good

672
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,779
we apply for nist and only after very

673
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,419
serious evaluation it can only be used

674
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,600
if it is if it is standardized let us

675
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,480
talk about Chateau so after Chateau we

676
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,600
had shastri which was standardized by

677
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,820
nisk but they were the better

678
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,580
constructions but they wear the better

679
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,919
constructions for example Blake to be in

680
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,679
but it was not standardized it still is

681
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,720
used in some products because it's

682
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,120
really it's really good but the way the

683
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,740
circumstance is why they didn't

684
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:40,260
standardize it so my my advice is and my

685
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,779
serious advice is not to use not to use

686
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,440
a crypto system which is not a knee

687
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,779
standard and as you said it will be

688
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,299
broken of course it will be broken until

689
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,260
it is a standard

690
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,860
police

691
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,799
bless you

692
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,140
uh thank you that was a great

693
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,440
presentation uh so you explained about

694
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,059
the uh

695
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,419
let's say the current computers and how

696
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,039
they use cryptography how the next

697
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,520
generation of computers will break it I

698
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,980
was curious if there are any uh

699
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,279
initiatives yet for creating uh Quantum

700
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,399
cryptography so by the time that we will

701
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,640
let's say start using them well even for

702
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,000
email let's say that we will have uh

703
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,399
that level of cryptography for them so

704
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,820
not one adapted for current computers

705
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,640
that is currently Unbreakable by them

706
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,820
but one that's unbreakable for them and

707
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,520
created specifically

708
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,279
specifically for them in cryptography we

709
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,700
have such primitive called one-time part

710
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,120
is that it's the only perfect Secrets

711
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,580
perfectly secret approach it is not used

712
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,000
in practice because there is very

713
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,480
difficult to exchange the keys and

714
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,580
theoretically but theoretical already

715
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,799
they are different the quantum key

716
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,179
distribution devices which can which can

717
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:21,380
pass the key on the long distance and

718
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,260
when there will be the devices that will

719
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,120
really be able to pass the information

720
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,899
on any distance securely and this will

721
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,460
be concretely the answer on your

722
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,179
question

723
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,840
so

724
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,799
difficult the algorithm like

725
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,840
difficultman but but Tiffy Helman is

726
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,519
it can be broken by quantum computers

727
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,960
they are the protocols e91 bb84 and

728
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,760
already these protocols give us the

729
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,580
opportunity to exchange the keys using

730
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,740
Quantum devices on very large scales

731
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,720
today I don't remember what is the

732
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,419
maximum score scale that was achieved

733
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,279
but it's still not enough

734
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,119
so when so it's a really big scale will

735
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,639
be achieved in this case if it is a

736
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,940
shift it is achieved we can we can

737
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,699
become and use these crypto systems

738
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,159
yes

739
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,320
we're running really short on time just

740
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,040
really shortly

741
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,460
no no I asked if you meant using

742
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,520
entanglement to reach distances is that

743
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,139
what I say

744
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,080
this is the protocol this is quantum key

745
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,379
exchange protocol bb84 concretely used

746
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,839
Quantum entanglements okay to exchange

747
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,000
to exchange the information

748
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,500
okay thank you sorry welcome

749
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,379
Professor let's go

750
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,459
[Applause]
