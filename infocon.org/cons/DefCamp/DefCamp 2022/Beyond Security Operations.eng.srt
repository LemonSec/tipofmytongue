1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,280
hi everyone my name is yodhan I'm the

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,600
security operations center for

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,640
expressvpn and today I'll be speaking

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,160
about Beyond security operations I know

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,960
that we're coming out of a lunch break

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,820
and this can be classified as the

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,559
graveyard shift in the afternoon hours

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:14,940
but I'll try my best to keep everybody

9
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,119
entertained for the next 30 minutes

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,220
so you know what I had a slide

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,960
specifically for an intro but I think I

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,359
do a disservice for you know our guest

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,920
speaker over here who pretty much

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,439
presented me uh pretty much my fields of

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,939
expertise our threat intelligence and

16
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,340
dfir and hobbies always include cats as

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,460
you likely see in the following slides

18
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,680
who we are as expressvpn security we

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,360
have three dedicated functions in

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,920
security engineering offensive security

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,680
and the sock where I've listed out some

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,180
competitions and highlights from the

23
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,739
last few years where we've participated

24
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,340
in ctfs where actually from today our

25
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,140
team participated in this year's Splunk

26
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,820
boss of the sock and we got fourth place

27
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,940
out of 86 teams and pretty much the Asia

28
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,340
region I've included some references to

29
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,899
our blog where we've published

30
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,059
information about vulnerabilities that

31
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,739
we found about different products and

32
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,180
different types of knowledge based

33
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,860
articles if you want to read more and

34
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,960
we'll go to one of them later on today

35
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,420
so today we'll cover what traditional

36
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,580
stock operations look like versus the

37
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,040
future of soccer the future which many

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,299
of you might have heard you know Google

39
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,979
and Deloitte kind of partnered up and

40
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,479
they analyzed what are some of the

41
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,799
common issues that Security operation

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,700
centers ex kind of feel on a daily basis

43
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,439
and how there might be some scalability

44
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,240
issues we'll look at what security

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,460
operations as a service is and we'll go

46
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,320
to intelligence threat modeling debt

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,119
hunting Automation and we'll take a look

48
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,700
at a case study using a world-renowned

49
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,140
company that I'm sure that all of you

50
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,799
know but before this it's Story Time and

51
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,780
let's take a look at a story about

52
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,820
recognized recognized versus

53
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,399
unrecognized threats I want you all to

54
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,860
picture yourself in a big Cosmopolitan

55
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,320
City like Bucharest New York London for

56
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,119
example and you're making your way back

57
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,820
home and you have to cross a dark alley

58
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,860
where there is a night lamp and it's

59
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,420
kind of signed you know shining a circle

60
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,979
of light on the ground and inside the

61
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,780
light you can see maybe a dumpster or

62
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,360
like a cat or a person but the question

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,000
is how how much of objective reality

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,920
does The Circle of Life represent and

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,660
all the threats that hide behind the

66
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,180
surface or could there be somebody

67
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,099
waiting behind with maybe a knife and

68
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,780
having the you know different types of

69
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,879
threads that we don't see we kind of

70
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,200
experienced this in the security

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,140
industry we know about about malware we

72
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,819
know about kind of cloud security Now

73
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,400
third-part usk run somewhere we've heard

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,379
about apt groups you know we've heard

75
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,780
about some today as well whether it's

76
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,459
your pandas your Bears your spiders

77
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,980
whatever they might not be but how

78
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,019
confident are we in saying that we are

79
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,879
capable of Defending against them 100 of

80
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,860
the time how confident are we in saying

81
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,780
in you know us being able to prevent the

82
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,760
next Supply Chain Bridge right we all

83
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,099
experience the lock 4J kind of event and

84
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,720
that was fun and it was around Christmas

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
so I'm waiting for the next one to show

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,360
up

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
so obviously this is as well the

88
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
confirmed wizard spider ring leader

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,180
based on what interval has personally

90
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,200
told me

91
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,180
and to kind of illustrate this I wanted

92
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,340
to give an example of something that I

93
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,500
we've experienced some time ago where a

94
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,140
year ago our book Bounty vendor told us

95
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,239
that we had a an email hijack

96
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,400
vulnerability that effectively

97
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,500
represented a fourth party risk which

98
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,480
we've never heard before but effectively

99
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,560
we were using a SAS provider that told

100
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,659
us to configure some DNS records for

101
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,060
marketing and analytics which you know

102
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,400
could be used on their third party to

103
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,680
register an account that you know due to

104
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,900
account validation problems allowed for

105
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,540
email hijacking uh turns out when you

106
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,879
said DNS cname records They also inherit

107
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,459
MX and txt Records which is perfect for

108
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,099
passing SPF which is all that was

109
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,599
required pretty much for the fourth

110
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,459
party provider and we also managed to

111
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,980
find out an undocumented SMTP feature

112
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,540
flag that allowed us to completely

113
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,180
bypass not just for the sub domain but

114
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,040
also for our top level domain and

115
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,080
sending you know emails from our billing

116
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,959
account we signaled this to the vendor

117
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,459
and they managed to be mediate it so

118
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,560
that was a good success story but you

119
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,879
know what happens if it's not a bug

120
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,500
Bounty submission what happens if it's

121
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,060
actually exploited in the wild how do we

122
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,040
you know fight these threats in the

123
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,420
traditional model we'd have kind of some

124
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,579
form of vendor 2 driven triage we'd have

125
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,139
to follow the some models so different

126
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,079
ones level one two three analysts with

127
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,180
Sops and you know dedicated instant

128
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,639
response engagement procedures we'd have

129
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,259
some form of Intel vendors feeding us

130
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,660
maybe Atomic iocs like hashes domains

131
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,180
IPS and we'd have some form of asset

132
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,820
inventory system that may not be real

133
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,160
time it's not perfect but it's useful

134
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,380
right and maybe even in the hybrid stock

135
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,240
model where we would you know dedicate

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,979
delegate some of those operational

137
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,020
components to different vendors

138
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,400
what I'm going to be pretty much

139
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,139
highlighting today is what Google and

140
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,060
Deloitte partnered up to analyze in

141
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,560
effectively creating the soccer of the

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,880
future where they're focusing on

143
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,560
operationalizing intelligence fat

144
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,840
modeling agile Dev support setups

145
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,820
leveraging machine learning and data

146
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,979
analytics doing threat hunting and I've

147
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,540
had it continuously for a reason there

148
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,240
investing in people and their skills not

149
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,060
tiers and prioritizing diversity over

150
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,639
completeness with you know some form of

151
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,500
structured procedural maturity but not

152
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,300
too much to stifle creativity and

153
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,280
obviously the king of all types of

154
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,440
enablers Automation orchestration and so

155
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,660
on with asterisk you see some of the

156
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,520
things that we will cover today

157
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,699
so nothing is perfect every single model

158
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,500
has its pluses and minuses in the

159
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,639
traditional one it's you know

160
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,139
well-established guidelines we have

161
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,000
Enterprise ready solutions that can

162
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,940
offer support and TurnKey Solutions we

163
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,680
can use a dividing concrete strategy

164
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,139
with level one two three analysts but

165
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,699
more often than not we have Socrates

166
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,380
building up we have a never-ending

167
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,060
Corpus of course that's been just

168
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,860
developed people like the Strategic

169
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,539
visibility because they're so caught up

170
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,580
in just responding to tickets all the

171
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,560
time that they just can't you know dig

172
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,020
deeper we also unfortunately in the

173
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,880
industry are seen as a compliance type

174
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
of you know institutional organization

175
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,660
where we're seen as the bad people and

176
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,460
not as an enabler and you know a team

177
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,560
that wants to make others successful the

178
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,539
stock of The Future model is slightly

179
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,039
different it's you know a lot more

180
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,960
objective here is all focused it's

181
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,300
around scalability flexibility metrics

182
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,160
it offers tactical and operational

183
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,560
insights that build that big picture and

184
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,120
it's closer to the software development

185
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,460
life cycle obviously you know there's

186
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,199
nothing that's perfect out there and

187
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,180
there is a steep learning curve of in

188
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,220
kind of transitioning to that you know

189
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,620
model of operating but and at the same

190
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,300
time you're kind of at the bleeding edge

191
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,039
of you know process Ingenuity you know

192
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,240
you're on your own you won't find

193
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,220
anything on page 10 of Google or stack

194
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,720
Overflow and how to transform yourself

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
towards this and there is a certain type

196
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,819
of org level mindset shift that's

197
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,800
required to create to see to make

198
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,340
security be effectively the

199
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,720
responsibility of everyone

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,259
so you know I wanted to show originally

201
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:54,840
the some wins and losses that we might

202
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,880
be able to share and with everyone but

203
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,440
somebody told me no so I decided to pick

204
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
for you know the next best Offspring

205
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,620
which is Acme Corp and their latest and

206
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,259
greatest Dynamite as a service as you

207
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,819
all know they're a leading company in

208
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,020
the explosive industry they're looking

209
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,639
to revolutionize the health and safety

210
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,680
Protocols of mining quoting and

211
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,020
construction they have a huge list of

212
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,120
Misfortune 500 customers in a sizable

213
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,419
b2c market share and they offer a new

214
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,419
iot device which is a remote Dimension

215
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,880
One which also integrates with Scuttle

216
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,740
systems and sensor networks and it's all

217
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,060
in the cloud and with a mobile app

218
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,419
because why not they are compliant with

219
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,340
all conceivable compliance Frameworks so

220
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,319
what could potentially go wrong right

221
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,000
and let's take a look at their Network

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,520
you know some they're all in AWS they

223
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,139
have some form of microservices for

224
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,180
marketing front-end apis they have a

225
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,819
back-end kind of processing system

226
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:46,800
centralized CI CD some form of you know

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
peripheral ec2 instance that Gary from

228
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,900
marketing apparently is using who knows

229
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,000
why they have a corporate internet where

230
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,139
they're testing their products and

231
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,819
software and they have a lot of remote

232
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,280
detonation devices that effectively

233
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,580
connect to the centralized cloudfont

234
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,680
environment and a lot of users from all

235
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,240
sorts of devices including apparently

236
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
ATV because you know why not

237
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,800
every good victim has their own

238
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
adversary and today's adversary is the

239
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,240
goodbye Kitty apt group believed to be

240
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,620
associated with the Middle Eastern vet

241
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,319
actor uh historic evidence of conducting

242
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,879
large-scale brute forcing credential

243
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,099
stuffing for post-exploitation they

244
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,300
preferentially target critical

245
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,520
infrastructure companies in the west and

246
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,960
they employ destructive capabilities

247
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,759
such as ransomware in the first stages

248
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,560
of an attack they use you know living

249
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,899
off the land more generic malware and

250
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,820
afterwards they bring in the big guns so

251
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,320
more sophisticated model for

252
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,880
post-exploitation and they're apparently

253
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,520
associated with the Roadrunner apt group

254
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,799
so what happened right turns out that

255
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,660
the goodbye Kitty apt group has been

256
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,580
targeting you know acne club for a while

257
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,680
they tried sending some mouse spam and

258
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,360
it kind of didn't work it was blocked by

259
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,339
the email security Gateway they tried

260
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,800
more targeted lures but the EGR solution

261
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,899
caught them and they tried doing some

262
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,000
scanning and exploitation but the well

263
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,560
application firewalls kind of blocked

264
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,380
them so no bueno there right but turns

265
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,660
out that they use a fast block fast flux

266
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,519
botnet to compromise some of the

267
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,440
developer accounts on the front-facing

268
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,899
login page which they found out that

269
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,339
they can be reused on their Version

270
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,899
Control software which was publicly

271
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,640
exposed as well from where they found

272
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,740
some secrets in commit history for

273
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,839
different repositories which they used

274
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,060
to literally move to the AWS environment

275
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,700
the kubernetes cluster and the API

276
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,440
portal from where they scheduled a

277
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,940
remote detonation for all customer

278
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,560
devices right

279
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,080
so is that everything that could have

280
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,880
happened or what if you know Gary's

281
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,459
office uh Gary's device was compromised

282
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,740
to bridge the internet what if an

283
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,420
adversary bought the actual product and

284
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,220
it was engineered it to see how they can

285
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,019
detonate it remotely from the network

286
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,420
what if a developers workstation was

287
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,220
compromised with some of the lures that

288
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,620
went through and their AWS profile

289
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,440
secrets were stolen or what if the CI CD

290
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,820
was used to actually move to the

291
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,260
environment regardless of there being no

292
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,360
credentials or what if there was an

293
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,860
Insight that sold access to the

294
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,080
environment or maybe a latest dependency

295
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,120
that pulled you know trojanized version

296
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,220
of a python package that was just

297
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,380
poisoned in a supply chain attack right

298
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,180
there's many many different options and

299
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,800
things that could have gone wrong

300
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,959
so let's rewind the tape and let's look

301
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,459
at how they could have known better so

302
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,100
Acme Corporation went back and in time

303
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,019
as well before this ever happened and

304
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,160
they created a security operations

305
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,380
pipeline which they offered as a service

306
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,660
to all their customers which go to the

307
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,820
funnel and effectively they produce the

308
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,440
different types of solutions and

309
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,420
software which is a lot more security

310
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,760
hardened as they proceed to each step

311
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,800
now full disclosure will go to the last

312
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,180
four which are on intelligence

313
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,680
development threat modeling hunting and

314
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,180
detection engineering but those are

315
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,700
effectively talks that can be multi-hour

316
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,440
long so I've tried to make them as

317
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,420
practical and example driven as possible

318
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,160
but bear with me if you have any

319
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,380
questions I'd be happy to take any after

320
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,240
and we'll start with intelligence right

321
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,620
there's there's we've all heard about

322
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,180
this term and there's many definitions

323
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,980
out there I personally like the last one

324
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,660
which is the ability to apply knowledge

325
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,820
to manipulate one's environment or to

326
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,140
think abstractly as measured by

327
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,240
objective criteria such as tests but

328
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,459
regardless of definition there's you

329
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,600
know one bottom line which is

330
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,459
information is power and can give you

331
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,260
leverage against your adversaries I've

332
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,320
included a photo of an actual failed CIA

333
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,540
operation where they weaponized a cat

334
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,579
just to show you how far those

335
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,380
adversaries are willing to go and spend

336
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,120
resources towards compromising their

337
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,100
victims but the good thing is we can use

338
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,899
the same type of methodologies they use

339
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,100
in their intelligent development

340
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,040
programs to identify them and solve them

341
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,420
in their tracks as well

342
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,760
so there's many different types of

343
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,560
intelligence domains you know we've all

344
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,000
heard of you know threat intelligence

345
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,519
about understanding your adversaries how

346
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,899
they operate how they export your

347
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,260
systems what their tradecraft is and why

348
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,880
would they actually exploit your systems

349
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,320
but there's all many other different

350
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,420
sub-branch domains that we can also find

351
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,220
such as brand intelligence and who's

352
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,480
trying to impersonate you to cause

353
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,940
monetary or reputational loss or fraud

354
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,380
intelligence and who's trying to default

355
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,180
you and how even vulnerability

356
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,740
intelligence and what is my

357
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,200
organizations you know fat surface when

358
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,880
it comes to bugs in like production

359
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,920
environments and what type of priority

360
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,019
and severity is associated with them no

361
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,320
we we all know I mentioned log 4J but

362
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,240
how confident are we in potentially

363
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,220
scanning and finding the next log for J

364
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,140
or even for the services that are

365
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,000
running our software and knowing that no

366
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,519
such packages are delivered with them

367
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,019
and we also have operational

368
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,760
intelligence in understanding how our

369
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,500
users use our systems whether it's to

370
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,420
cut costs or reduce abuse there's many

371
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,620
different ones

372
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,079
and the Cohen Foundation of building out

373
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,880
an intelligence program is centered

374
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,740
around three three portions which are

375
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,300
developing the priority intelligence

376
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,279
requirements and speaking to your

377
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,620
customers and stakeholders and inferring

378
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,300
what their biggest concerns are to their

379
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,000
systems processes and functions then the

380
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,560
security function can take those and

381
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,820
they can distill them into more

382
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,680
answerable questions that are broken

383
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,440
down and by collecting collection

384
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,480
requirements that answer those specific

385
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,579
questions which we can integrate and we

386
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,160
can create specific action plans to

387
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,860
actually drive decision making which we

388
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,959
should never enforce as the whole idea

389
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,540
of intelligence products is we put

390
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,220
Security in the hands of our engineers

391
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,779
and we don't enforce things that might

392
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,880
be disruptive or disruptive to the

393
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,220
actual business itself the final one is

394
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,320
a shared responsibility piece which is

395
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,700
very important as it establishes

396
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,920
partnership in between those functions

397
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,760
so you know nothing good is you know it

398
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,079
wouldn't be good if there's no example

399
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,519
so I decided to you know create one

400
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,779
where the product operations team

401
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,120
requires in information on methods on

402
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,399
which malicious actors are abusing our

403
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,620
services and using them maliciously and

404
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,180
we can break that down as a requirement

405
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,220
to create information requirements that

406
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,560
are more targeted questions such as what

407
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,940
Brute Force scripts can we identify

408
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,740
across the deep and dark web or telegram

409
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,360
channels or whatever it might not be

410
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,399
that's referencing our publicly facing

411
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,139
infrastructure or how many of our

412
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,360
existing customer credentials are

413
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,160
available in public you know data

414
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,019
breaches and dumps or what type of

415
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,579
volumetric data do we have on our

416
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,380
perimeter that might signal some form of

417
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,180
credential stuffing right now that we

418
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,320
have those questions we can start

419
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,139
looking for the data and support of

420
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,519
those questions so we can answer them

421
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,079
for example we can create a collection

422
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,300
requirement around you know some form of

423
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,160
VR signatures that we deploy in virus

424
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,260
total to find popular brutal scripts

425
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,180
such as open bullet that are referencing

426
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,740
our infrastructure we can configure

427
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,079
Triggers on the leak pendar web for

428
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,519
notifications when somebody is

429
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,959
mentioning us and hacked accounts or

430
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,880
compromised credentials we can create

431
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,339
some form of active monitoring for any

432
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,260
of our customers in being present and

433
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,019
have I been born in any public data data

434
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,660
based dumps or we can even sample some

435
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,040
of our cloudflare web application

436
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,680
firewall logs you know to identify if

437
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,420
the Pareto Principle is in place where

438
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,639
20 of our top Talkers in terms of

439
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,920
infrastructure represent 80 of the

440
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,899
potential malicious traffic right and

441
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,459
after we've compiled this we can also

442
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,019
even have machine learning models for

443
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,240
what's you know Baseline user Behavior

444
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,399
versus anomalies what is expected versus

445
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,980
what is not because in order to you know

446
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,420
fight evil you must know what good luck

447
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,060
good looks like first after that we can

448
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,440
take this and we can integrate it into

449
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,120
our systems and we can create those

450
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,680
action plans to either suspend the

451
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,600
accounts or even you know suspend the

452
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,459
infrastructure trying to access them in

453
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,440
order to mitigate or reduce the blast

454
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,260
radius but you know even if we develop

455
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,240
20 or 50 priority intelligence

456
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,740
requirements and we prioritize them

457
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,019
intelligence does not mean that

458
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,060
prevention completeness and we kind of

459
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,399
want to be a bit more proactive and

460
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,019
that's where fed modeling comes in where

461
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,399
we take you know with this we

462
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,100
disassemble the actual uh systems and we

463
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,019
look at them end to end because it

464
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,060
doesn't necessarily mean that you might

465
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,740
not be targeted because you're the prime

466
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,600
target but there's stepping stone to

467
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,519
such there's many different Frameworks

468
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,019
out there such as you know more other

469
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,660
ones like Star pasta taxis playing cards

470
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,000
whatnot but turns out acme core point is

471
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,260
something that's a lot more closer to

472
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,000
the software development life cycle so

473
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,920
that they can integrate it as a portion

474
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,019
of the development process such as test

475
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,139
driven development in the part of where

476
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,260
people use Security in the design and

477
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,180
create systems which are hardened from

478
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,660
the beginning right so how would we

479
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,579
convey this to our developers which

480
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,620
aren't necessarily Security Experts like

481
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,360
us well they're kind of used to doing

482
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,220
user stories so why not create malicious

483
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,860
user Source in the form of fed scenarios

484
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,540
where we can start asking those

485
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,279
end-to-end questions and how do people

486
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,199
get access to our systems what can they

487
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,779
do with that access over there what can

488
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,339
they do to actually move to other

489
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,600
systems that are closer to the crown

490
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,339
jewels and how can they evade our

491
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,139
defenses those are just some examples

492
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,300
they're not the finite you know infinite

493
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,860
there's not a finite list of everything

494
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,779
that you can potentially ask but they're

495
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,220
a good starting point in driving those

496
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,440
discussions we obviously need a way to

497
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,480
prioritize all the threats scenarios and

498
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,120
basically have a way to highlight what

499
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,399
is the worst versus what does not

500
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,199
constitute additional measures being

501
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,360
required so we can start scoring them

502
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,399
you know we can use things such as the

503
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,459
1380 severity and it manifesting the

504
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:57,899
business impact it can have the

505
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,519
complexity required for its exploitation

506
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,320
and the likelihood of it being

507
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,240
prioritized from an advocacy to achieve

508
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,339
somebody's objective we can always use

509
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,439
also the existing controls to formulate

510
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,660
a more concrete view of what the surface

511
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,400
for the actual application is and

512
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,079
afterwards the cool thing is we can take

513
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,699
a look at all the scenarios and what

514
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,500
attack monitor techniques are comprised

515
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,599
to create a map which effectively is a

516
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,419
taxonomy of all the techniques and which

517
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:22,919
are the most prevalent ones so we can

518
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,839
prioritize control recommendations so

519
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,880
that there's some economy of scale when

520
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,679
you're dealing with threats at a larger

521
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,480
scale right

522
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,580
and you know what would be an example

523
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,440
for some fat scenarios for example

524
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,299
somebody might want to get access to the

525
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,340
API service for Acme Corp to a remote

526
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,220
code execution in order to obtain a

527
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,960
foothold into acne corbs environment

528
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,700
where you know from a score of one to

529
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,919
five very simple they have a you know

530
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,419
significant severity and you know

531
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,280
significant you know confidentiality

532
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,960
Integrity availability impact direct

533
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,419
access to private systems uh confirm

534
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,860
business impact extended action is

535
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,179
required to actually remediate it

536
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,860
somewhat you know more tailored

537
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,900
exploitation you know with good Recon

538
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,660
and higher value Asset being compromised

539
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,220
so high likelihood as it's a stepping

540
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,020
stone to such with some form of controls

541
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,179
but not too many the relevant attack

542
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,559
techniques are the following and

543
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,000
effectively you can recommend that maybe

544
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,320
there's some hardening that can be done

545
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,120
or pen tests or even monitoring of

546
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,640
command execution right but

547
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,980
what if we list out five initial access

548
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,080
in those scenarios and we miss out two

549
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,059
of them right well the good thing is we

550
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,559
can say okay when they have access

551
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,240
already to these systems what can they

552
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,860
do and you know the next one is about

553
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,320
detonation of customer devices where you

554
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,580
know they already have pre-existing

555
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,320
access to the API service and they just

556
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,020
push out a scheduled job so maxivability

557
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,059
destructive nature potentially impacting

558
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,799
human lives Mac business impact

559
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,200
catastrophic monetary reputational laws

560
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
low complexity they're already there and

561
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,679
all the tokens and service calls are

562
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,240
available on the system and Max

563
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,919
likelihood because it's high value for

564
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,960
for low effort and absolutely no

565
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,240
controls right right a perfect perfect

566
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,000
storm and a perfect 100 so we can you

567
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,400
know do some type of recommendations on

568
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,140
how you can put some controls such as

569
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,520
you know two-step verification for

570
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,280
privileged actions or pki or monitoring

571
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,840
privileged calls there's many different

572
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,980
ways

573
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,280
and the good thing is a good threat

574
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,660
hunting function in the saw can actually

575
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,280
take a threat model and now with the

576
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,679
extended fed surface they can start

577
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,039
hunting in a hypothesis driven way where

578
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,419
you know a good threat Hunt is one which

579
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,679
is structured well scoped and go

580
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,780
oriented and I pretty much want to you

581
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,660
know I like you know volunteers alerting

582
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,860
detection strategy and I'm trying to

583
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,419
promote it as much as possible but it's

584
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,520
a one which effectively allows you to

585
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,559
drive hunting engagements and produce

586
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,380
Monitoring Solutions as well so how does

587
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,419
it look like very briefly effectively

588
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,280
you have a high level goal of detecting

589
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,539
you know malicious scheduled remote

590
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,580
detonation jobs for a large volume of

591
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,860
customers with the relevant attack miter

592
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,900
techniques there's a strategy abstract

593
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,220
that which describes that maybe you know

594
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,860
there's a rabbit mq jobs being pushed

595
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,020
which are going above a two-week moving

596
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,360
average some technical context about the

597
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,280
SPO or whatever you know searching

598
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,140
language you're using with some blind

599
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,760
spots and assumptions that you know the

600
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,320
logs are being forwarded and false

601
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,880
positive such as on Monday when

602
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,140
everybody wants to explode everything

603
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,080
and detailed validation steps on how you

604
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,419
can maybe use a Lambda function to you

605
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,280
know do continuous control validation

606
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,620
with the potential response of you know

607
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,740
holding all the the queue the jobs

608
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,960
processing queue and paging out the API

609
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,660
team until it's resolved right

610
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,539
so but wait how is this different from

611
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,340
regular alerts right

612
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,980
targeted hunting engagements can produce

613
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,720
alerts but they shouldn't be the focus

614
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,760
more often than not when we do some form

615
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,679
of other generation we are overzealous

616
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,200
with our allow listing and those create

617
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,539
pretty much gaps that more sophisticated

618
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,660
adversaries can exploit and it's usually

619
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,580
a lot better to catch everyone

620
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,860
eventually than to catch only some

621
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,799
instantly so we are State Hunters you

622
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,120
know and that's why I put continuous

623
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,220
threat hunting should be doing one thing

624
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,020
specifically and not using our keyboards

625
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,700
and browsing to many systems to do

626
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,440
validation we should let Automation and

627
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,179
robots do that for us we should be

628
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,799
diving into data and searching for the

629
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,260
anomalies before the Alert review cycle

630
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,940
is happening because more often than not

631
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,460
we can actually miss things so it's the

632
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,140
data that's surfacing up potential bad

633
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,000
things and there are ways that we can do

634
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,780
this one of the things that we actually

635
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,580
prioritize in acne corrupt as well is

636
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,340
effectively going and venturing in as a

637
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,500
fit analyst into the data mine for

638
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,120
example where you can look at all the

639
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,740
Powershell events in one environment

640
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,620
which will good for some you know Blue

641
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,780
Sky research but they're way too noisy

642
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,880
usually but what an analyst can do is

643
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,940
they can create more refined Haystacks

644
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,980
where the chance of there being a needle

645
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,659
inside is much larger such as for

646
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:45,299
example Powershell command executions

647
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,179
with more than 200 200 characters now

648
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,640
that's a lot better for now digging in

649
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,940
deeper and over time effectively after

650
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,620
we transform multiply and transition

651
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,780
this we can effectively create concrete

652
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,760
signatures by multiplying those for

653
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,140
example and searching for the keyword

654
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,900
mimikats in the refined Haystack and we

655
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,159
can potentially create you know

656
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,720
different variations of it to have

657
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,220
something that is a good place to start

658
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,559
your instant response Now by creating

659
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,480
multiple of these Haystacks now you can

660
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,460
tag the data sources based on their

661
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,500
miter attack techniques to create chains

662
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,179
of exploitation paths that they can link

663
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,740
together for more advanced correlation

664
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,380
but obviously none of this would ever be

665
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,539
possible without the biggest enabler

666
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,000
which is automation where you know it

667
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,380
saves time and whether you're using

668
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,539
slackbot notification locations to

669
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,059
potentially help engineers and deliver

670
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,620
the security of their products within

671
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,080
their hands or infrastructures code to

672
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,419
manage your you know alerting Fleet or

673
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,940
even Sigma to abstract away from complex

674
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,000
Sim specific language automation saves

675
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,760
time and it allows Hunters to do what

676
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,260
they should be doing which is hunting

677
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,120
for those threats and digging through

678
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,900
data that is pretty much all I had I

679
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,880
know it was a pretty quick one thank you

680
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,620
very much if you are looking for any

681
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,960
opportunities please take a look at our

682
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,760
website and I'm happy to take any

683
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,919
questions

684
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,919
foreign

685
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,760
if nobody wants to ask questions I'll be

686
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,320
at the stands after so you can guys talk

687
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,000
to me as well

688
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,380
uh one question over here

689
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,419
hello

690
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,280
so what is your opinion on what the

691
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
company using a traditional stock model

692
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,539
should focus on but first in order to

693
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,299
make it easier for it to transition for

694
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,520
to a future stock model that's a very

695
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,220
good question basically one of the

696
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,659
things that I think is extremely

697
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,780
important is developing I mean it's a

698
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,700
non-technical thing where you have to

699
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,100
develop the trust with your partners to

700
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,559
ensure that they can support you in your

701
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,840
journey in transiting over so that you

702
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,520
can delegate some of those you know

703
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,260
responsibilities and Building Things

704
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,940
securely because if the security

705
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,039
Operation Center is responsible for 100

706
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,900
Services we only have a limited amount

707
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,820
of human resources that we can handle

708
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,020
all of them so we'd always be a

709
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,240
bottleneck for example if you're tasked

710
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,039
with doing the you know threat modeling

711
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,820
for 100 Services then basically the

712
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,039
production of those systems and

713
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,840
development so that they can go in a

714
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,360
secure state to customers is going to be

715
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,039
severely hampered so we need to create

716
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,840
this shared responsibility model where

717
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,020
we convey that it's in you know we want

718
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,700
to help you but you have to help us as

719
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,620
well and education is a big portion of

720
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,080
it automation definitely is something

721
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,200
that also helps in making sure that

722
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,559
analysts are not bogged down by a lot of

723
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,900
false positive alerts and determining

724
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,940
what is something that is truly

725
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,100
malicious versus what can be looked at a

726
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,320
later stage frequently we might get

727
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,299
examples of you know privileged access

728
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,580
being used for some server correlation

729
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,200
between you know I.T change management

730
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,299
systems and those can delegate some of

731
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,280
that responsibility to the robots so

732
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,960
that we don't need to deal with you know

733
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,539
3000 thousands and thousands of alerts

734
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,280
and we can focus on expanding the Corpus

735
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,840
of what other bad things can be

736
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,580
happening

737
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,418
yeah thanks
