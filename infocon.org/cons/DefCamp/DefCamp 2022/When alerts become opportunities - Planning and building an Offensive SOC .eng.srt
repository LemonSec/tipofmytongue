1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
you my first time in Romania lovely to

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,279
be here it is even the weather outside

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,660
is beautiful look at this awesome

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,120
fighter jet slider PowerPoint has a

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,340
feature called Pimp My slide or actually

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,619
it might be it might be design

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,539
suggestion or something like that but

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,220
basically you click that button magic

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,520
happens and now I get airplanes my talk

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,660
is on when an alert is an opportunity I

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,300
am not a blue team person although I've

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,859
done a little bit of that as well I'm a

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,860
red team and an alert for me for my sock

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,579
is basically hey potential hacking of a

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,180
customer the alerts are my opportunities

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,340
so quickly my name is Chris Dale and I

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,200
present at Sands I run my own company

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,640
there's an alphabet soup of

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,860
certifications and so on and I did get a

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,300
lovely introduction already so I'm not

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,719
going to spend time on that basically my

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,120
skill sets is within pen testing I show

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,039
how criminals break in or threat actors

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,379
break in and how help kick them out

25
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,619
again instant response when those things

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:05,939
happen

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,720
so think about this question why do we

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,840
do penetration testing what's the goal

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,880
of a pen test

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,200
right really simple dumb question what's

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,860
the point of asking for a pen test say

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,180
once a year

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,540
is it so that the system can say are we

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,580
there yet and if the pen test findings

35
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,220
are are resolved there are nothing

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,340
things to be concerned about is it so

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,560
that you can fix and patch in the short

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,640
term

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,860
is it so that you can have long-term

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,960
security advantages to help the security

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,780
posture of your company become more

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,460
resilient

43
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,360
pen testing in its own very often it's a

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,420
snapshot in time what the scope of the

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,820
pen test the security what it currently

46
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,360
looks like and it's a once a year once a

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,180
quarter it's very often just a snapshot

48
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,399
in time what happens tomorrow after the

49
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,540
pen test

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,758
you just received a fantastic ciso is

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,139
happy yeah

52
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,260
tomorrow log 4J happens

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,620
tomorrow the engineer Bob reconfigures

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,840
the firewall tomorrow they released a

55
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,000
new service tomorrow open SSL there's a

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,440
critical bug

57
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,120
pen testing is anything but agile it is

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,739
anti-agile

59
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,260
developers are agile operations are

60
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,420
agile but what the hell happened to pen

61
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,680
testing

62
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,599
bug Bounty is the closest that we're

63
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,340
getting to Agile currently and I'm

64
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,080
proposing some new ideas and models that

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,660
will basically help us do more agile pen

66
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,000
testing there are some common problems

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,860
as

68
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,780
getting a pen test and delivering a pen

69
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,459
test so I've worked a couple of years as

70
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,860
a ciso and I've for many years provided

71
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,680
pen tests and when I was a sister I had

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,260
to go buy pen tests from other companies

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,940
and my oh my my question was always

74
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,920
should I put in the scope

75
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,680
what should be what should I ask them to

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,000
pen test

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,159
and it's not I might not be the best

78
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,680
person to know how a hacker thinks where

79
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,080
a hacker might break in so to be honest

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,180
the customer the client the once

81
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,879
procuring pen tests they are not in my

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,159
honest opinion they're not skilled

83
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,319
enough they're not good enough to know

84
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,599
what they should have a pen test on

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,599
anybody heard of Shadow I.T

86
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,480
by definition the ciso will never ask

87
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
for a pen test on Shadow I.T because

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,560
they don't know about that I.T

89
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,599
also in my experience when I do instant

90
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,000
response which is sadly a lot

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,739
that's why I get gray hair so shave old

92
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,599
massage now get rid of all the white

93
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,280
high white hairs

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,640
when I do instant response very rarely

95
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,220
is the incidence happening on the the

96
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,920
front chest of the customer it's not on

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,420
their front websites it's not on the

98
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,400
systems they knew about whenever a

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,720
customer gets hacked it's on those

100
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,080
systems that they go like ah oh no that

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,540
system that old one the one that they

102
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,220
forgot the one that they didn't have

103
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,379
under governance hence pen testing very

104
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,780
often pen tests the things that they

105
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,220
know about and you don't get a good

106
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,798
complete picture when I provide a pen

107
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,940
test

108
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,040
I have to be contained within a scope

109
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,019
right so the customers will tell me

110
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,479
maybe I propose a scope to them then we

111
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,580
begin the pen testing a systems a b and

112
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,759
c and while I'm pen testing I'm like

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,860
hackity hack hackity hack and all of a

114
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,320
sudden I see another system

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,900
another system on the side on the side

116
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,120
somewhere maybe some old PHP application

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
and I start to drool I'm like oh that's

118
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,740
where I want to hack

119
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,440
but they won't let me right I could go

120
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,300
back to my customer I can say hey we

121
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,979
found this other system actually we want

122
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,840
to hack this system and the customer

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,699
will not be disappointed because that

124
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,500
scope creep and they're going to have to

125
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,479
put more money on that engagement

126
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,380
so there's all these challenges within a

127
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,780
traditional pen test and let me ask the

128
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,360
question does an attacker care about the

129
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,800
scope

130
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,360
hell no right

131
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,180
and we must do our best to mimic

132
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,180
attackers we must do our best to do what

133
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,759
attackers do to be relevant in this

134
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,040
industry otherwise penetration testing

135
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,620
will not offer the good value that we

136
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,380
should be giving to our customers

137
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,660
there is this hilarious video on YouTube

138
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,340
I really want to quickly show you and

139
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,340
narrate to you it is awesome it's the

140
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,440
siso versus the pen tester let's see if

141
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,600
I can bring that in here you see that's

142
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,979
why I see and some some people are

143
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,680
laughing already it is hilarious right

144
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,560
I'll narrate it sister has a pen test or

145
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,400
a gun and he says really should be come

146
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,520
on hit me bro hit me

147
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,220
oh no no no that's dangerous man come on

148
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,979
I'm ready for you pen tester says all

149
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,260
right let's have a go at this point

150
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,979
[Laughter]

151
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,539
that is how I find pen testing

152
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,680
to be to be in very many cases

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,199
so early on

154
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,720
many years ago I came up with a proposed

155
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,039
solution that I've spoken about on

156
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,259
conferences here and there and I've been

157
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,759
delivering to customers for a while now

158
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,180
it's the digital footprint assessment

159
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,819
when a customer asks for a pen test when

160
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,800
they come to USA we want a pen test you

161
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,539
tell them no you don't

162
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,520
you don't want to spend money on a pen

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,259
test because well you don't know what

164
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,600
the scope is yeah we do we want these

165
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,160
applications to be well that's not where

166
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,360
we're going to break in if we're really

167
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,280
going to break in in fact you tell your

168
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,340
customers you want a pen test okay but

169
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,780
first let us do a small engagement where

170
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,000
we do reconnaissance scanning and

171
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,600
discovery of assets let's first go back

172
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,120
to our hacker roots and do what we're

173
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,220
supposed to do we're supposed to

174
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,440
discover our targets we're supposed to

175
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,740
figure out what the lay of the lands is

176
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,340
and will present our findings by just

177
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,780
looking at the customer we're not

178
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,120
hacking yet by just looking at our

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,180
targets we will present our findings in

180
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,580
a report that we call digital footprint

181
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,440
report for example a digital

182
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,580
online

183
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,639
and in this report we will give our

184
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,419
Target a prioritized list of assets

185
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,800
these are the ones that are attractive

186
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,319
to my team these are the ones that makes

187
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,880
Chris drool

188
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,120
this is a 10. I really want a pen test

189
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,259
this target

190
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,479
so why let me

191
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,199
why don't you remove that Target if I

192
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
can show you that this target is super

193
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,340
attractive to hack because it has old

194
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,919
components because it looks very

195
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,840
hackable you know that hacker hunch that

196
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,160
you get sometimes say yeah I can

197
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,020
probably hack this one when you have

198
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,319
that hunch why let that system be pen

199
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,919
tested why not just deal with it

200
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,780
in advance provide value by just looking

201
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,060
in so many cases by just Google Dorking

202
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,479
by searching via search engines we can

203
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,160
prove to a customer that they're

204
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,319
vulnerable to certain things finding

205
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,419
copies of SQL databases and all kinds of

206
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,780
things by just doing reconnaissance

207
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,960
and we should in advance provide this

208
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,479
value of credential leaks to be stuffed

209
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,360
of targets list of IP addresses social

210
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,099
media accounts whatever it might be put

211
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,659
that in a report

212
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,080
so that the customers know what could be

213
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,420
in the scope of a pen test and what you

214
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,200
suggest and most importantly what they

215
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,899
don't put in a scope of a pen test

216
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,660
show them what was left out so that you

217
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,019
can take an a concise and actionable

218
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,880
decision on what to leave out of the pen

219
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,620
test and what to actually have to test

220
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,160
this in my opinion has made the life for

221
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,980
the customers much easier and it's also

222
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,779
made it much more fun and and

223
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,880
stimulating to work on pen testing

224
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,440
engagements because we've kind of done

225
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
our job already doing recon and

226
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,820
discovery in short it boils down to

227
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,320
these three points

228
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
know the target

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,220
that's what we should do as pen testers

230
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,680
we should know who we're targeting find

231
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,580
as much value as you can by using osent

232
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,720
by using apis by using your hacker

233
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,899
census scan discover you don't need to

234
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,600
exploit and verificate those exploits

235
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,880
yes yet let's provide as much value as

236
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,200
we can

237
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,300
earlier in the engagement for less money

238
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,060
and let the customers essentially know

239
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,620
themselves

240
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,459
so this idea is quite nice and it brings

241
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,860
in a topic called attack surface

242
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,200
management which is where the offensive

243
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,779
security operations operate attack

244
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,080
surface management is taking the idea of

245
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,500
raycon Discovery and scanning and

246
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,779
automating those process and collecting

247
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,959
information continuously allowing us to

248
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,080
see the Delta what changes on a

249
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,800
customer's digital I.T footprint from

250
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,720
one day to another

251
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,360
if you look at pen test methodology

252
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,880
what pen tester should be doing is they

253
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,220
should be doing recon scanning Discovery

254
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,920
and exploitation in their engagements

255
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,100
but I am sure that many of you can say

256
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,380
and attest for that pen testing in the

257
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,899
last last few years has revolved a lot

258
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,000
around Discovery and scanning

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,279
and most mostly on exploitation and

260
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,500
verification it has been focused on

261
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,140
recon and it hasn't really focused on on

262
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,740
aiming broad it's been very narrow very

263
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,779
specific and targeted on what the

264
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,820
customer wants or what you figured out

265
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,920
during a scoping meeting and so on

266
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,899
so attack surface management is

267
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,860
basically helping us to automate knowing

268
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,040
ourselves and figuring out what there is

269
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,420
to pen test

270
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,880
so from one iteration of a scan or one

271
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,740
data collection point to another we can

272
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,920
always discover and see what's new

273
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,860
what changed which ports are open from

274
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,899
one day to another

275
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,940
to be successful

276
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,000
in in in hacking in bug Bounty programs

277
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,360
and so on it often comes down to which

278
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,420
team has the best Recon process

279
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,700
I've always said it to my teams or when

280
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,920
I'm lecturing for Sans the most

281
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,200
important phase of a pen test is not the

282
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,360
exploit phase in fact the face that

283
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,420
determines our success is the Recon you

284
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,760
do a good job on reconnaissance and you

285
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,019
can be certain that you're going to get

286
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,640
you're going to go break into something

287
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,959
interesting

288
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,860
and Recon if you're good at Recon it

289
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,380
allows you to find what we call the path

290
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,440
or A Road Less Traveled those systems

291
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,899
that nobody else found nobody else has

292
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,459
been there in a while they're old

293
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,140
they're unpatched or unmanaged

294
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,240
ungoverned there might be juice

295
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,519
interesting things in them

296
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,000
and to find the paths least traveled you

297
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,860
need to have a good Recon and it often

298
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,899
comes down to process what tools and

299
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,779
capabilities does your team use how well

300
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,600
are they word lists how nice how well do

301
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,399
they know their target how much

302
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,620
information do you have on them so that

303
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,959
you can discover more assets and other

304
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,100
interesting parts of their

305
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,300
infrastructure

306
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,399
and the teams that can find the most

307
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,140
interesting parts that are the ones who

308
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,940
get the bug Bounty they're the ones to

309
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,019
get in

310
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,320
you know the NSA their Chief tailored

311
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,300
access operator the guy in charge of

312
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,339
breaking into other countries right

313
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,100
uh Rob Royce he held a presentation over

314
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,500
on use next conference many years ago

315
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,660
and he had a presentation on how to

316
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,420
protect yourself against the NSA the big

317
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,339
bad wolfs of the internet kind of right

318
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,820
they're revered respected notorious loss

319
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,040
of elite hackers in the NSA

320
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,200
how do you protect against them though

321
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
well he went through many great points

322
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,899
in this presentation and he told us as

323
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,459
an apt

324
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,860
we don't have to be very much Advanced

325
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,899
necessarily we just have to be damn

326
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,360
persistent in fact when we're done with

327
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,560
our targets

328
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,019
we know the target better than they know

329
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,339
themselves

330
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,980
imagine that knowing more of an I.T

331
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,800
Network than the I.T guys themselves

332
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,500
that's our job as pen testers but we

333
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,260
seem to forget it so he boils down again

334
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,899
to Recon having good systems to provide

335
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,360
you valuable data to use in your tools

336
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,220
and techniques to find interesting

337
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,019
systems

338
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,560
there's also a dilemma in today's worlds

339
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,800
our organizations that we work for most

340
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,500
of them want rapid changes they want

341
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,839
more with less they want to deploy

342
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,459
deploy deploy

343
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,560
they have something shiny they want to

344
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,600
show it to the world they want to

345
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,019
innovate and they want to grow I.T

346
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:10,100
security they want to contain govern

347
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,220
slow they want to verify and sure and

348
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,800
make sure that we deploy trusted things

349
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,200
those two things work against each other

350
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,839
and attack service management helps

351
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
bridge the gap we're kind of

352
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,339
acknowledging that shadow I.T and we're

353
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,680
acknowledging that dark data and

354
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,079
unmanaged ungoverned changes are going

355
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,779
to happen we're planning for it and we

356
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,700
want to see it before anybody else does

357
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,620
with attack service management

358
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,199
so it's a nice bridge to allow us to

359
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,779
Well Control our assets better and know

360
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,240
ourselves more continuously

361
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,660
and that brings us into what I have

362
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,019
called Always on pen testing

363
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,339
because if you have a tax service

364
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,740
management that's basically discovery

365
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,079
that's basically Asset Management it

366
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,079
allows you to keep on checking is my

367
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,360
logo being abused somewhere is there any

368
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,940
new ports open on my services Etc but

369
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,639
always on pen testing takes in the third

370
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,040
part of the process into the equation

371
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,459
we're now saying any new change any

372
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,519
Delta any new credential leak any port

373
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,639
that is open whatsoever

374
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,279
assign that task to a pen tester instead

375
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,320
of doing a pen test for a week no we're

376
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,240
going to do a micro pen test on a single

377
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,920
port on a single application on a new

378
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,560
update wherever it might be verify the

379
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,660
cve understand this vulnerability

380
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,279
management information where you're

381
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,320
talking about micro engagements that are

382
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,800
talking about minutes and hours not days

383
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,860
weeks or months of Engagement times

384
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,680
so the always on pen testing kind of

385
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,699
brings agility into pen testing world

386
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,500
if we can get customers to pay for it

387
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,019
that is but yeah some are especially the

388
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,820
forward leaning systems that realize

389
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,660
that

390
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,540
are we hacked yet are they already in

391
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,420
probably those types of cisos they're

392
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,740
willing to pay for such a service like

393
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,120
this where they make a contract with a

394
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,339
pen testing company and they say we

395
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,720
don't want to hire you for an engagement

396
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,000
we want to hire you for a year

397
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,339
let's see what you can do in a year

398
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,740
be our criminal best friends on the

399
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,940
internet except you're not criminals

400
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,220
we're hiring you for a contract

401
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,860
what can you do as an apt what can you

402
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,320
do as a persistent threat and hopefully

403
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,199
you hire someone who's Advanced as well

404
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,360
can we manage this

405
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,600
it helps us greatly because to me pen

406
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,339
testing has been like where old

407
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,740
dinosaurs

408
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,500
slow moving trying to provide value

409
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,139
while the criminals and the tracks are

410
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,940
shot there there are agile short-lived

411
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,860
rabbits going everywhere going sneaky

412
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,180
here sneaky there trying to find

413
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,860
vulnerabilities

414
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,240
it's like pen testing we're playing

415
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,620
badminton Boop

416
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,019
and uh professionals they're trap actors

417
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,320
they're playing tennis

418
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,199
oh super fast right completely different

419
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,880
sports

420
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,299
and this type of concept helps us bring

421
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,439
back

422
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,099
value to customers so that we can stop

423
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,079
cyber threat criminals and so on other

424
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,179
types of trap actors

425
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,819
hard to be a hacker

426
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,000
to me you look at instant response

427
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,020
very often it is easy to be a hacker

428
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,419
it doesn't have to be a very complicated

429
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,760
and we could do better as pen testers

430
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,820
and as red team and so on it boils down

431
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,740
to Warfare

432
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,539
these two fighter jet Pilots here

433
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,340
fighting in a dogfight

434
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,440
in military training they have a saying

435
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,200
that the Fighter Jet Pilot who has the

436
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,160
quickest and most often UDA Loops will

437
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,960
win the battle

438
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,620
an UDA Loop is the ability to observe

439
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,020
so observe our surroundings detect the

440
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,880
tract Orient ourselves is there

441
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,320
mountains these are missiles these are

442
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,020
weapon systems and so on decide on an

443
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,559
action and act on that action the ones

444
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,120
that do that the fastest and the

445
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,340
quickest wins the battle

446
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,380
what about in cyber

447
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,980
we observe we see Lord for Jay

448
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,440
holy Lord for Jay everybody works

449
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,960
overtime let's Orient ourselves how bad

450
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,940
is this it's really bad

451
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,799
decide on a course of action do we tell

452
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,000
our customers yeah let's tell them

453
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,559
preemptively there's something big

454
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,000
happening and we're scanning their

455
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,100
networks trying to figure out if we can

456
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,679
exploit them if we find something that

457
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,059
we've exploited something we can

458
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,799
weaponize into an exploit get a callback

459
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,980
or whatever let the customers act on

460
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,120
that finding

461
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,220
where we prove that they can be hacked

462
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,039
if they can act before the criminals can

463
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,020
complete their ooda Loop before they can

464
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,760
weaponize their exploits and take over

465
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,900
your server

466
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,820
if you can patch faster than that then

467
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,440
you won that battle

468
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,120
and there's not a battle just around a

469
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,919
corner Tomorrow there's another

470
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,020
vulnerability and another one and

471
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,260
another one it's not getting easier

472
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,620
so UDA Loops helps us we should also

473
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,260
strive to reach maturity

474
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,840
and and consider how how we mature

475
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,100
essentially

476
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,740
if you're a common company these days a

477
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,600
normal company that haven't invested a

478
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,520
lot of cyber security you're probably on

479
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,780
the scale of proactiveness and

480
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,520
reactiveness you're probably over here

481
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,140
somewhere where you're blocking attacks

482
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,760
with your edrs you bought some Next

483
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,799
Generation firewalls perhaps you got

484
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,600
some prevent the measures and so on and

485
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,740
if something bad happens you're doing

486
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,179
instant response

487
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,720
right then the sister asks all right we

488
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,980
just invested in a lot of cyber security

489
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,720
are we there yet

490
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,559
and the ciso procures a penetration test

491
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,539
and after the pentas is done they're

492
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,179
like yeah we did it boys what's next

493
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,280
where should we build what should we

494
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,400
invest in and a lot of companies they

495
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,919
seek to build and invest into a security

496
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,500
operations center manage detection and

497
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,020
response they're seeking to start to

498
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,660
build that capability of looking at

499
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,940
alerts and looking to see is our defense

500
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,220
is failing sitting with our Spirits

501
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,900
inside a castle waiting for somebody to

502
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,160
breach the wall that's where we're

503
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,260
setting us up against or setting us up

504
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,919
for

505
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,419
what we're challenging with attack

506
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,280
service management and always on pen

507
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,460
testing is perhaps in fact it might be

508
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,059
easier cheaper and higher value to

509
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,179
before you mature into sock or maybe at

510
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,400
the same time consider maturing into

511
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,980
weaponizing and operationalize your pen

512
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,640
test teams to work for a year at a time

513
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,820
put those people to work every day and

514
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,160
let them do a tax service management let

515
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,780
them know you better than day you know

516
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,059
you know yourself let them know the

517
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,860
attacker better than anyone else you're

518
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,240
going to win that battle

519
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,820
that's what we're challenging instead of

520
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,160
waiting for some alert to come to say

521
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,380
hey they found an exploit let's clean up

522
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,020
we're saying hey let that alert tell the

523
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,340
pen pastors that hey there might be an

524
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,080
exploit here check it out before anybody

525
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,520
else can

526
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,919
that's what we're doing

527
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,179
and

528
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,940
the next few slides are basically

529
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,280
there's I have almost 60 slides in this

530
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,500
presentation okay I'm not going to go

531
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,020
through them all they are for you I have

532
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,820
uploaded a slide so that you can go over

533
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,860
them afterwards for inspiration or ideas

534
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,860
on how to build out your offensive

535
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,900
security capabilities that allows your

536
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,940
pen testers to do real-time work agile

537
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,020
and so on

538
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,000
there are many different components that

539
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,580
could be a part of a offensive sock and

540
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,460
I'll talk about some of them for example

541
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,380
public domains

542
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,799
domains typically is the entry point for

543
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,360
some kind of application or it provides

544
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,400
some kind of attack surface that we want

545
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
to stimulate or we want to Target we

546
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,240
want to check it out we want to scan it

547
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,500
we want to discover if there's

548
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,240
invulnerabilities there we want to know

549
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,520
if there's any outdated technology or if

550
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,620
the technology becomes outdated in the

551
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,640
future

552
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,340
so when we are doing attack surface

553
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,159
management it very often revolves around

554
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:04,260
domain information and we can get a lot

555
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,940
of domain information by being good

556
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,580
hackers we can say brute force their DNS

557
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,860
servers asking tons of questions using

558
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,919
the specialized word lists to see can we

559
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,600
get any more domains any more attack

560
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,159
surface

561
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,340
we can also become purple

562
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,320
we do this with Cloud assets and we can

563
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
also do it with domain assets we can mix

564
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,419
blue and red we can go to our customer

565
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,600
whom is our partner right they've hired

566
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,820
us to do the best job possible we can

567
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,520
ask them hey why don't you why do why

568
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,260
don't you guys just give us the Zone

569
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,720
transfer of the entire DNS server why

570
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,580
don't you just give us all the results

571
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,159
that you put in your DNS so that we know

572
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,200
of every domain

573
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,120
that's cheating

574
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,720
we like to cheat cheating allows us to

575
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,299
beat the real threat actors because

576
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,640
we're emulating an adversary or an track

577
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,580
Factor but really we can cheat and

578
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,500
become a better trap actor for the

579
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,120
benefit of our customers

580
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,640
say in Cloud assets we deploy Lambda

581
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,280
functions in AWS we deploy functions as

582
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,200
a service in Azure and same thing in

583
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,760
Google Cloud compute and we let those

584
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,740
functions run twice a day and it just

585
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,020
collects the entire asset inventory of

586
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,360
the Target and it gives it to the pen

587
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,679
testers

588
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,020
hey bro so you guys you're with me right

589
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,880
I know you're really dangerous and

590
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,559
you're hackers and all of that stuff but

591
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,419
why don't you see what this gives you

592
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,940
does this weapon ask you any any at all

593
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,799
does this give you any entry points to

594
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,179
our businesses

595
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,280
we should cheat

596
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,600
perhaps the most useful ever

597
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,539
technique for hacking is looking for

598
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,940
certificate transparency looks

599
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,760
when your operators your developers Etc

600
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,700
when they deploy a domain or s in fact

601
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,220
when they create a certificate the

602
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,460
certificate Authority must publish that

603
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,039
certificate in a public log that is

604
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,840
Success that is accessible by your

605
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,840
browsers and anyone to read

606
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,179
that way we can make sure and they can

607
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,700
verify that hey these certificates that

608
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,799
are being generated on our domains and

609
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,260
so on they're authentic they're good we

610
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,480
approve of these these certificates it's

611
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,679
a way to protect ourselves against

612
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,980
malicious or compromise Cas and so on

613
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,360
but those CTL logs they contain super

614
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,120
useful information for example I

615
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,860
searched up death camp while I was in

616
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,240
the back of the room

617
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,580
and I searched this on a website called

618
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,159
search.sh you can search for Google and

619
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,000
Facebook they have a similar

620
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,340
functionality and ask what kind of

621
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,700
certificates have death camp created

622
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,679
and I figured out there's the latest def

623
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,539
comp there's an event admin death camp

624
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:48,000
there's an event API

625
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,640
oh this is where I want to break in

626
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,380
these are the systems that I want to

627
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,880
find I want to find the PATH least

628
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,919
traveled to I want to find the more

629
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,520
interesting ones and the CTL just shows

630
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,380
me public information

631
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,020
yes a wild card certificate would would

632
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,480
help you defend against this

633
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,059
the NSA does not recommend you to use a

634
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,100
wild card certificate either they know

635
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,840
more than we do and they have something

636
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,659
nasty with wildcard certificates or they

637
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:16,740
don't want to lose this technique

638
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,080
themselves I don't know

639
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,080
but it's super useful when we do attack

640
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,679
surface management we don't monitor for

641
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,200
say deaf dot camp

642
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,320
we don't monitor for our customer.com

643
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,440
domain we monitor for the customer's

644
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,020
brand death camp

645
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,559
and we look for defcam.com

646
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:41,240
devcamp.site

647
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,700
whatever any mention of the customer's

648
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,000
brand in these logs that are millions of

649
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,100
millions of certificates every day

650
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,100
any mention of the brand we get an alert

651
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,799
on sometimes we have hundreds of new

652
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,080
domains that represent our customers

653
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,059
brand because their domain name by

654
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,860
accident is a part of a random generated

655
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,720
domain or it's it's a part of something

656
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,600
not interesting whatsoever lots of false

657
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,679
positives

658
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,559
but every week or so we see new domains

659
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,539
being created that are set up to fish

660
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,279
our customers

661
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,900
so all of a sudden somebody sets up

662
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,120
River security

663
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,779
dot dash gdpr security.com something

664
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:22,799
something

665
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,919
that pops up on our radar and if we can

666
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,779
automatically score and assess that

667
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,640
system hey this new system River

668
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,200
security blah blah blah blah

669
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,240
does do they used to say Mail Exchange

670
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,039
as River security does do they use the

671
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,020
same name server does it look like Road

672
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,700
security it's a logo present on a

673
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,940
website Israel website and so on all of

674
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,120
a sudden we can combat a lot of targeted

675
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,220
phishing attacks credential harvesting

676
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,980
attacks and so on it becomes super super

677
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,960
useful

678
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,700
there's all kinds of ideas and

679
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,740
possibilities out there for example URL

680
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,960
shorteners me and a friend we did a

681
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,779
project on this we took the archive

682
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,760
teams they have a team called URL team

683
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,460
we took their data where basically their

684
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,820
data is brute forced URL shorteners so

685
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,220
they take bit thylai and all those URL

686
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,020
shortener services and they Brute Force

687
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,000
the extensions behind them they use

688
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,279
wordless to find content they abuse

689
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,140
Brute Force algorithms and so on and

690
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,240
they publish the results

691
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,100
and we found that super interesting we

692
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,679
took that research data and put it into

693
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,659
kibana

694
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,240
and Elk basically stored in elastic and

695
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,159
visualized it with kibana and we start

696
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,080
digging through all that data looking

697
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,179
for our customers

698
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,159
looking to see hey is our customers

699
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,380
represented in any URL shortcuts and

700
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,179
sure enough we found our customers but

701
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:44,880
we found so much more outside of the

702
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,159
thousands of hotel reservations airline

703
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,679
tickets and all kinds of things we found

704
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,860
hacks in progress where an attacker is

705
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,919
URL shortening an attack sending to his

706
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,880
friend

707
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,220
for basically sharing and exploit with

708
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,179
them we find it operators sharing backup

709
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,820
files among the team members on public

710
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,039
web servers hey Bob take a look at this

711
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,080
ZIP file I put on the server over there

712
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,779
and it's URL shortened and they don't

713
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,179
delete the zip file afterwards

714
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,039
so the results of this you can find

715
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,500
online is on a blog post at sas.org but

716
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,360
it was very fun and interesting to see

717
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,940
how can we be more clever in discovering

718
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,919
not only the the provisioned attack

719
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,900
surface our customers are deploying but

720
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,539
also anybody else who talks or mentions

721
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,760
about our customers

722
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,620
we see a lot of this

723
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,659
part domains

724
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:38,880
when a domain is part so some of our

725
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,559
customers they buy hundreds of domains

726
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,179
right and they just leave them there

727
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,760
parked so nobody else can steal them

728
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,460
what should you do as a pen tester

729
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,179
you should know if this changes tomorrow

730
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,520
does this website become something

731
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,279
tomorrow does the DNS change tomorrow

732
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,620
so you deploy say a website Delta

733
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,020
Checker a DNS Delta Checker that you

734
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,880
receive an alert when there might be

735
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,380
some content here

736
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,200
because you want to be the first one in

737
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,179
in certificate transparency logs and

738
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:10,860
doing these kinds of work we have

739
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,080
examples of Stories on how our Panthers

740
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,000
first of all have a lot of fun at work

741
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,400
it is really fun being agile and doing

742
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,559
work continuously but we have stories

743
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,600
where for example one of my customers

744
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,520
they had deployed two new domains over

745
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,159
in the U.S their service provider had

746
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,140
been given these two new domains to set

747
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,080
up voice over IP Microsoft teams

748
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,299
integration something something so they

749
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:34,559
have a service provider that is

750
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,360
currently using those two domains to set

751
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,740
up a new service

752
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,039
all right nice the certificates so

753
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,840
obviously these Services need hatred to

754
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,039
be asked certain certificate goes into

755
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,740
the public log and my team they get push

756
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,620
notifications hey hey new domains let's

757
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,840
go first one in huh let's see if we can

758
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,340
find some vulnerabilities let's hunt for

759
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,720
some cool juice

760
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,299
some cool learnabilities

761
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,840
and we see a blank website nothing there

762
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,940
yet all right website website Delta

763
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,039
Checker turn on blink blink every 10

764
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,720
minutes we check does this website

765
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,120
update no all right every one day does

766
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,460
it update in fact after about a couple

767
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,340
of hours the website update it now has a

768
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,440
commercial off-the-shelf product

769
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,779
and then asking for a Logan

770
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,520
all right interesting they're deploying

771
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,860
some solution here so once there's an

772
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,779
application there the pen testers follow

773
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,640
their procedures they start to do what

774
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,980
we call content Discovery brute forcing

775
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,779
folders and file names Etc see if

776
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:31,919
there's anything interesting and sure

777
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,559
enough after a few minutes we find a

778
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,020
folder called slash logs

779
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,080
you open up slash logs inside there's an

780
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,000
indexed list of every single log file

781
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,440
the commercial off-the-shelf product has

782
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,140
created wow that's convenient we click

783
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,299
one of the log files inside the log file

784
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:50,820
turns out the product is logging

785
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,820
credentials in plain text

786
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,820
we found within 24 hours the super admin

787
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,340
password to the service provider and the

788
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,960
admin provider of the it administrator

789
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,820
over in Texas us

790
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,539
within 24 hours was that hard

791
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,940
was that advanced

792
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,179
no but was it persistent absolutely heck

793
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:12,899
yeah

794
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:15,240
absolutely persistence and persistence

795
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,640
tends to win there are so many things we

796
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,320
could talk about but I really want to

797
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,120
leave open for some questions Network

798
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,659
Services trackers Splash websites and so

799
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,880
on you know whenever you see this page

800
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,200
here

801
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,779
as a pen tester at least as an offensive

802
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,240
person you know there's something more

803
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,159
nobody puts the web server online just

804
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,480
to show this picture

805
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,120
what else is there and one of the best

806
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,640
pro tip bug bounty hunting tips I can

807
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,640
ever give you is to utilize IAS short

808
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,320
name scanning

809
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,840
there is a way to abuse the fact that

810
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,360
your Microsoft servers support old

811
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,059
Legacy dos Syntax for file names and we

812
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,100
can Brute Force the names of files and

813
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,279
folders and we can discover that file

814
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,779
that is for example here's the process

815
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:03,779
here we are using a is short-term

816
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,820
scanner against a Target website and we

817
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,059
have found something called M tilde1

818
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:10,799
okay then we'll Brute Force the next

819
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,740
character Meme and then we can Brute

820
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,100
Force the extension so met that day dot

821
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,740
zip turns out it was metadata.zip and

822
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,799
inside our ZIP file we found gold we

823
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,360
found what we were looking for to prove

824
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,340
value to the customers Tech stacks and

825
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,620
so on take a look at this right there

826
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,940
are so many different things here we

827
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,980
could spend a long time talking about

828
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,380
but I'm going to leave this value for

829
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,480
you to research on your cells okay

830
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,179
social media user accounts leveraging

831
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,740
brand reverse image searching and so on

832
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,380
I just want to give back some value

833
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,120
what I hope that we're going to do in

834
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,080
the future

835
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,200
and think about more is when we're in

836
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
our Castle trying to build High walls to

837
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,919
protect ourselves

838
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,260
instead of sitting aside with spares I

839
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,940
want you to go out

840
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,220
Leave Your Castle

841
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,820
defend forward go outside and find these

842
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,100
pastors down here digging a tunnel into

843
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,240
your Castle

844
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,220
go out and find that there are people

845
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,980
poking holes in your Castle see that the

846
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,559
moth is there's no more crocodiles and

847
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,419
the water has run out

848
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,940
going out of the castle and defending

849
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,399
forward continuously is really nice it

850
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,980
really supports the top 18 controls what

851
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,679
is control number one and two inventory

852
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,440
of assets and software

853
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,980
pen testers should have that inventory

854
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,779
and it also supports other controls as

855
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,760
well same thing with other core and

856
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,840
principles

857
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,460
so I'm going to be done here in a second

858
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,580
now uh basically Sun Tzu said it the

859
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,260
best know yourself

860
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,500
you can know yourself acid in entry no

861
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,760
the enemy

862
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,679
everybody can learn to hack it's not

863
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,019
necessarily hard and you will not fear

864
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,880
the results of 100 Battles it is really

865
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,700
that easy not

866
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,159
everything is easy sounding but it's

867
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,620
complex thank you everybody I don't want

868
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,000
to take up any other speakers time only

869
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,220
room for changing and so on and perhaps

870
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,960
even questions so so thank you very much

871
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,918
for listening to me

872
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,940
we can take a few questions there's time

873
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,219
for this so any questions in the

874
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,520
audience

875
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,040
uh there's a question over there towards

876
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,239
the back

877
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,980
there's got to be questions like how the

878
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,179
hell do you scale this how do you

879
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,040
operate this how does it work like how

880
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,599
do you prioritize how do you have time

881
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,060
do you ever sleep I understand that you

882
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,540
have gray hair now yes and so on

883
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,780
so let's hear it hi is this thing yeah

884
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,060
um so in the beginning of your talk you

885
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,119
advocate for customers allowing you to

886
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,980
run Lambda functions in their Cloud

887
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,399
environment yes to collect asset lists

888
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:57,000
yes how how do you suggest that at the

889
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
end of your relationship the customer

890
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,320
secure against the fact that you now

891
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,540
have all of this information great

892
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,520
question thank you very much so those

893
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,580
Lambda functions it's our code

894
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,220
right we wrote it but we give the code

895
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,380
to the customer to deploy in their own

896
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,300
environment so that they can see what's

897
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,880
being run and they can disable that

898
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,280
Lambda function at any time they want to

899
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,099
they are the ones that give that Lambda

900
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,140
function the security auditor role

901
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,460
they're the ones doing privilege

902
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,200
management they don't give us

903
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,940
credentials basically this Lambda

904
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,280
function just twice a day so it's an

905
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,859
event based Lambda function twice a day

906
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:38,040
on a timer it posts a message to an API

907
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,920
that we have online for the customer

908
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,020
sending us that data

909
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,460
so hopefully that answered your question

910
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,160
so how so we would uh so at the end of

911
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,359
the relationship we would have to delete

912
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,920
the data right

913
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,020
and and or and also protect it obviously

914
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,660
but but in terms of protection uh we

915
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,099
could go into the architecture of

916
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,619
customer segregation no multi-tenancy

917
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,480
how it's deployed in different Cloud

918
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,460
environments and different vpcs and so

919
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,520
on so yeah we definitely need to protect

920
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,960
the information that we manage and so on

921
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,680
uh well well we're their best friends

922
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,780
right except we're trying to break into

923
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,460
their environments uh

924
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,599
I have no churn on our customers yet

925
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,680
uh but okay I'm sorry I'm

926
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,760
misunderstanding at the end of the

927
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,800
relationship

928
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,839
how we delete the data or

929
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,500
contracts I guess or maybe they can do

930
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,780
what they did in uh in Men In Black

931
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,400
rights give us the little thing in front

932
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,560
of the eyes and it goes and they wipe

933
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,839
our minds

934
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,359
so how do you delete your do you delete

935
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:09,000
your pen test reports you should

936
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,339
right you don't wanna you don't wanna

937
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,140
let your customers get hacked when you

938
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,420
get hacked so after a month we delete

939
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,859
our pen test reports after we're done

940
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,079
with them but we do store kpis and

941
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,400
interesting information but we don't

942
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,800
store the findings it gets deleted

943
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,880
right thank you hey all good man

944
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,640
are there any other questions if okay

945
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,099
one more question up here at the front

946
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,260
you'll also find me at the Sam's Booth

947
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,240
later with George

948
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,420
so I'll be around for a couple of hours

949
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,579
quick arrests okay I have a question uh

950
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:45,180
more administrative side of things here

951
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,400
so all the examples that you've provided

952
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,220
so far they rather show more reactive

953
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,079
approach towards things when it comes to

954
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,260
incident response and I would like to

955
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,800
ask like in the last 10 years or five

956
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,579
years how has it changed from reactive

957
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,260
to proactive

958
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,480
what's the increase in percentage let's

959
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,700
say and not necessarily big customers

960
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,140
because you mentioned that they are

961
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,960
willing to go proactive but maybe small

962
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,579
and medium

963
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:17,880
so this this kind of service for us is

964
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,680
typically for larger customers that

965
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,020
realize that reactive is going to be

966
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,720
very painful and with crowdstrike's

967
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,520
beautiful report on the breakout times

968
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,500
that the Bears the Russians are down 20

969
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,940
minutes until they've compromised one

970
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,520
asset and they pivoted away they realize

971
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,020
that they need to do more proactive

972
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,540
measures but it's typically reserved for

973
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,940
companies that are in the thousands of

974
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,339
employees typically small medium

975
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,680
businesses it just doesn't scale for us

976
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,320
on this service because this is very so

977
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,839
you can get 80 on the way with

978
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,359
automation right automation robot

979
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,700
scanners it gives us some value but the

980
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,380
value of a service like this comes from

981
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,720
actually qualifying that those those

982
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,460
vulnerabilities that their scanners have

983
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,400
found if are they really worth it is

984
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,640
there false positives or not can I hack

985
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,280
you yes or no and that requires human

986
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,740
intelligence and interaction with the

987
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,880
alerts

988
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,040
so it scales to best for larger

989
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,440
customers not small medium businesses

990
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,119
but when you put on always on pen

991
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,520
testing it's it's a lot of work thank

992
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,119
you so much that's
