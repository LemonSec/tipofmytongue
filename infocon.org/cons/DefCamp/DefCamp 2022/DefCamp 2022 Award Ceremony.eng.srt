00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,519
so um

144
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,160
this was a bit of a more humid ocean

145
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,399
type of thing so basically if you

146
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,080
thought things get couldn't get any

147
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,540
weirder you had to play Target John but

148
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,000

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,680

the secure open vote election

326
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,520
thank you

327
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,360
okay so a few years ago at Defcon not to

328
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,340
be confused with deaf Camp the one in

329
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,280
Las Vegas I hacked a mock election

330
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,160
reporting system when I was 11 years old

331
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,860
and I'm like I can build a better system

332
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,700
than this so I created my election

333
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,740
reporting system for my voting system

334
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,740
secure open vote I brought it to Defcon

335
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,679
about two years ago no one was able to

336
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,200
change the vote count so I brought it

337
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,059
this time to Europe thinking maybe

338
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,520
someone can hack it here and no one was

339
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,740
able to change the vote count so I can't

340
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,720
give out any prizes because no one could

341
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,539
hack my system thank you there we go

342
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,899
and now

343
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,059
last but not least last but not least we

344
