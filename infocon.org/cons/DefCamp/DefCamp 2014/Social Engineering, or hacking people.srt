<font color="#E5E5E5">about 20 years ago or so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">great social engineer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you read the</font>

43
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,569
book he wrote the art of deception<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

44
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,700
goes a long way<font color="#E5E5E5"> into describing how</font>

45
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:43,299
social engineering works and how he was

46
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,119
able to get a lot of information by just

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:49,090
talking to people<font color="#CCCCCC"> he didn't have to do</font>

48
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,190
any sort of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hollywood hacking stuff</font>

49
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,340
with the access denied access granted

50
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">type of stuff note that he only had to</font>

51
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,860
talk to people

52
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:02,739
things are changing in the industry and

53
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,080
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I showed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that piece of</font>

54
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:08,590
video that's from the movie hackers from

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,709
nearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years ago is that this is not</font>

56
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:16,390
something new<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been going on for</font>

57
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:18,430
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the fact that we are not aware</font>

58
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,529
of it doesn't mean that it's not there

59
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,720
and it's not happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it doesn't</font>

60
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,709
mean that it's not happening to you and

61
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just went on and grab like two or</font>

62
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,320
three pieces of news from the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

63
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:37,540
months alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is recent stuff</font>

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:40,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not something from 20 years ago</font>

65
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's still going on and it's going on</font>

66
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,790
probably more than before and we're

67
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:51,910
gonna cover that in the in a bit

68
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:55,660
the thing is there's so little awareness

69
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,940
of the topic and so little<font color="#E5E5E5"> do people</font>

70
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:03,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that they're vulnerable to this</font>

71
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:05,019
that makes it so efficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

72
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,500
people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cannot be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> target</font>

73
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:10,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not that stupid it's the the guy</font>

74
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,359
next to me that's going to be the target

75
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">because he's dumb as a brick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

76
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:21,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

77
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:26,320
so with that being said this is a report

78
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:28,450
from the UK government which shows that

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,330
a lot of small businesses and large

80
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations have experienced some form</font>

81
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,599
of a breach in the past year and this is

82
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:40,330
stuff that they know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

83
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:46,150
really successful attacks are the ones

84
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:47,830
you don't know about and from many

85
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,340
sources

86
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:54,460
some say<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty percent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some say seventy</font>

87
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:58,090
eighty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> it varies and you know</font>

88
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:01,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">78.5 percent of statistics are invented</font>

89
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:04,210
on the spot so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd say that most attacks</font>

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,780
come from within the organization it's

91
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,729
not something from the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's from</font>

92
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,119
within the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's either</font>

93
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who's trying to do harm and</font>

94
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,700
works for the company or somebody that

95
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,950
got duped into clicking something

96
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,440
installing something on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ink us on his</font>

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer running some code on his</font>

98
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,800
computer and giving access to someone

99
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:36,250
outside but the attack will originate

100
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:40,120
from the inside and just to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> in-depth</font>

101
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,140
on the time it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for attacks to be</font>

102
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,180
discovered

103
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,450
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's a really good attack</font>

104
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're a really good hacker</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

105
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,770
get caught<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't get detect you</font>

106
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:54,310
don't end up on the news<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys that</font>

107
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:57,280
show up on the news<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hacker got into</font>

108
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NASA servers we see that all the</font>

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,109
time over here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Romania cuz we're and</font>

110
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,690
we're proud of that as well those are

111
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,099
the stupid hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are the ones</font>

112
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,140
that get caught

113
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:10,780
well they may be the lucky ones because

114
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,490
they usually don't get up the they

115
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,049
usually don't end up in prison they end

116
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,690
up being hired by the companies that

117
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,080
they act<font color="#E5E5E5"> into or other companies for</font>

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,719
that matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> but going back to this graph</font>

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,630
you see it takes

120
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:29,260
there's no seconds or minutes on the

121
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:32,409
graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes from hours to days two</font>

122
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,130
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> two months or even years to</font>

123
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:36,780

125
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it's not instant you end up finding</font>

after it happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what happens in</font>

128
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:54,330
that time is really out of your control

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> while attacks go</font>

130
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:01,740
this is a fairly recent study in the

169
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so what social engineering is is</font>

170
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:12,760
the science of making people do what you

177
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:38,319
secure the system is if you can trick

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:55,180
vulnerable and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is rather easy</font>

181
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:58,329
to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the times hard to</font>

lot of things that we think we do right

185

and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there were a couple of</font>

sessions yesterday and today<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">Benjamin yesterday talked about</font>

cognitive<font color="#CCCCCC"> biases and critical thinking</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we've seen some of some of the other</font>

190
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,350
stuff today

191
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:28,510
it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily with false assumptions</font>

192
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:31,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">like if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i say if it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rains then the road</font>

193
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,040
is wet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm looking at the road now</font>

194
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,430
the road is what

195
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore it must be raining that's</font>

196
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,949
false

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,410
it could have been any other reason you

198
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:44,139
could have had like the truck coming in

199
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:49,300
to wash the street or you could have had

200
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:52,810
a flawed<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> river just passing by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

201
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's no reason for you to infer</font>

202
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,089
that if the road is wet

203
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,760
it's raining and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

204
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:04,680
familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a joke with the old cowboy</font>

205
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,420
and the lesbian right if not there's

206
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,270
this old<font color="#CCCCCC"> cowboy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in a bar</font>

207
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,069
drinking his<font color="#E5E5E5"> whiskey and out to him</font>

208
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,620
comes a woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they start talking</font>

209
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,779
this and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and life in the universe</font>

210
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,690
and everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point she</font>

211
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:21,810
mentions that she's a lesbian<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

212
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:24,690
she does all day is think about women

213
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,880
and then the discussion moves on and she

214
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,459
leaves at some point he gets left there

215
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,770
with with his glass of<font color="#CCCCCC"> whiskey few</font>

216
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes later a couple walks in go</font>

217
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:37,050
straight to him hey are you a real

218
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:39,120
cowboy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he says well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

219
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:44,819
that up to a few minutes ago but now we

220
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:47,640
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lesbian right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's</font>

221
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,010
the false assumptions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up</font>

222
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,410
putting you in a place that you

223
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:56,939
shouldn't be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> its the logical</font>

224
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:59,790
fallacies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up making you think</font>

225
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,089
in a way that doesn't get you to the

226
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,430
right conclusion and it's the the mental

227
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:08,640
shortcuts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every day to make</font>

228
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,199
your life easier to not have to decide

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,000
every second

230
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,970
what to do how to act in social

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,270
situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you see a guy in a suit</font>

239
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:41,040
curiosity is also something that could

be of interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

242
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:50,459
eight years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> company in the US did a</font>

244
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:56,670
try and see how much data they can

00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,890
gather on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on their target company in</font>

246
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,800
a couple of weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what they did is</font>

247
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:04,620
they set up a bunch of USB sticks with

248
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,589
malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> they went into the company</font>

249
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,630
parking lot at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the boring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

250
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:15,060
those memory sticks around and left

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:17,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">people came in at the office at 7am got</font>

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,839
out of the car and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh look a memory</font>

255
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,620
thing you do you take it and you go into

256
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,959
the office and you plug it into your

257
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,150
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want to see what's</font>

258
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,579
on it or at least you need to format it

259
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,959
so that you can use it for your own

260
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,089
purposes later on

261
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,420
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment that they plugged in</font>

262
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:44,579
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> USBs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the malware ran it got</font>

installed it ran on the network for two

264
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:48,750
weeks and in two weeks they<font color="#CCCCCC"> got access</font>

265
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:51,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">to I think nineteen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-five percent</font>

of the computers in the network without

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:59,430
even entering the premises<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

268
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:01,199
humans are curious and there's a nice

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,620
website you're going to see the link in

270
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,410
the in the slides when you when you get

something in return

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,379
attacks you have the basic persuasion

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,890
impersonation

544
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,960
I've touched on<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a bunch of these over</font>

545
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,900
the session so far

546
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,860
why are companies vulnerable to social

access to information about that company

554
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:04,220
that you can use to launch an attack

555
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:07,910
against the company you can come in and

556
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,500
act as a user or a customer or contact

557
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:13,220
one of the employees because you found

558
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,780
them on<font color="#CCCCCC"> LinkedIn because they're listing</font>

562
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,860
find personal information and then you

563
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:25,939
can use that personal information that

564
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:28,969
you've gathered to act as if you are

565
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,860
that employee when calling the company

566

or emailing tech support

567
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:37,219

don't know what the other is doing so

you can work very well with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

the most likely to give out this

how the cleaning lady dresses and you've

there's the high-profile targets that

have the most information you need

happening in the industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of the</font>

those incidents usually come from inside

there you go you have lateral movement

hacked into the entire system

yes that's a nice and airy oh but that

663

doesn't usually happen unless that

years before they were discovered

676
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:01,980

paranoid about your employees or your

it now

and employee entry procedures and it's

686
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,820
nice to know that yes when an employee

00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,669
take all the measures to ensure that his

689
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:38,520
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> access is revoked and perhaps he's</font>

690
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:41,069
got his<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15-day notice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you monitor him</font>

691
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,469
during that time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what you don't know</font>

692
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:46,560
is that he probably decided to leave

693
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:50,279
your company<font color="#E5E5E5"> two months ago and in that</font>

694
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,529
time he got all the data that he needed

695
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">so by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time he tells you that he</font>

696
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,620
wants to leave

697
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,540
he's already got the data that he wants

698
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:00,509
it doesn't matter that you cut off his

699
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,730
axis and over eighty percent of the

700
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,380
people leaving a company usually leave

701
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,020
with private or confidential information

702
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if it's just in case</font>

703
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,230
like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a programmer and you've</font>

704
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:12,419
been writing code for<font color="#E5E5E5"> three years</font>

705
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:15,510
you're not gonna leave without your<font color="#E5E5E5"> coat</font>

706
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's your code you've written it</font>

707
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,460
even if the company now owns it

708
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,530
what if you have to write the same piece

709
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,010
of code somewhere else<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

710
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:27,540
gone through all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort to figure</font>

711
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:32,520
out the best way to do it so you're

712
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:35,819
going to make a copy and the way to

713
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:39,089
protect yourself against these types of

714
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:41,460
attacks is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've heard yesterday</font>

715
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:43,230
critical thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> right before you do</font>

716
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,460
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and slow down and think</font>

717
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,829
things through

718
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,270
is this really happening to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

719
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that I'm supposed to be doing</font>

720
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:54,780
is this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:58,440
giving out and you can

722
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:03,660
yeah you can be a really nasty person

723
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,790
and reject any requests for help<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if</font>

724
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,220
they're not a legitimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they don't</font>

725
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:11,190
make any sense other than helping people

too much information

731
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:27,240
what can that information do to me or my

732
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:28,589
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it gets up and there's a</font>

simple things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> phishing emails were</font>

855
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:08,810
for non-technical people they work great

856
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:11,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's if you have a way of sending</font>

00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:17,810
trick the person into believing that's
