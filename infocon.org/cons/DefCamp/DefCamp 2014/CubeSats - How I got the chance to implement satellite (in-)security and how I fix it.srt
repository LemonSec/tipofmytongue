1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,469
yeah hello everyone I'm Marriott's

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,629
or and Sonata and us already said

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,610
I will tell you a small fairy tale about
cuter

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,849
but before I actually start I know

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:17,410
you are probably all tired you hat

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,740
some compre one of day of conference
already behind you probably before some

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,599
workshops and

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,260
the amount of rebel size 3 you a timeout
so Am I

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,550
asset I played the city at so please
excuse more of a lot the case

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,600
some will happen and the second warning

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,950
is that my presentation styles kind of a
little bit more lucent

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,100
so yep you will see the presentation
itself is

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,149
a ranch and three parts for us to fall I
will tell you a little bit about cute

14
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,360
shirts and that security situation

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,649
itself than I'm telling a little bit

16
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,140
about the things that the stuff I didn't
and

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,270
at the end of presentation I want to
actually share some impressions inside I

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,800
do it

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,280
I got your my rock so let's start with
our fairytale

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,650
not so long time ago in a galaxy

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,390
close by cube sets am

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,070
in ninety 99 Kelly pool and stand for

23
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,850
where developing and publishing the cute
it's done

24
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,850
the main aim is too

25
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,899
be able to produce small satellites to
reasonable cost bringing for low-cost

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,229
into space they have size about all one
unit cube that has a size of

27
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,020
10 cubic centimeter actually the show
ps3 in order to

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,399
and they get so-called piggyback lost

29
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,740
so when a rocket is going up by several
to the ISS

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,149
there are some slots reserved for cube
set at the August

31
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,170
just on the way getting shootout delores
Robert and

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,530
do you do that the third costs extremely
low from

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,399
over several millions to from classical

34
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,909
cue a project that's no reliable with
less than a million

35
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,039
to bring up small satellite in space but
remember it's a very small

36
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,329
satellite

37
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,540
this small costs

38
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,549
May 3rd especially attractive for
universities

39
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,670
to look into those projects to get
students to work with cute

40
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,489
and in between they are over hun 100% of
the small satellites around in space

41
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,630
farewell brought up by different actors

42
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,820
universities also some commercial ones
and

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,350
the a much greater community is also
quite unprecedented

44
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,829
so-and-so yep its computation however

45
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,120
this presentation focused mainly on
academic you

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,760
sets so let's have very simplified
Strathmore

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,200
where some object we have three ways to
access it

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,820
first of all weekend for the Clean
Access so that the excess emission

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,620
I will say it's quite hard with a
satellite the link

50
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,019
excess the communication between the
base station and the satellite

51
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,620
is ready to open I mean it's

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,760
transmitted over nope medium everybody
can

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,179
eavesdrop ever the crib to try to
encrypt if it's plain text just listen

54
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,620
to it

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,970
and possibly also said their own
messages to

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,230
the satellite and then another threat of
course

57
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,570
if the network access so actually

58
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,200
that an attack our world compromise the
base station which

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,859
us done quite a few times for commercial
satellites

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,829
however this earth not part of this
presentation

61
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:42,850
here we are mainly focusing on the link
access so

62
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,519
let's look how dusa security looks like

63
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,709
well for I'm not a radio and commercial
satellites

64
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,769
from there mainly the classical
solutions they're using encryption is on

65
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:55,340
the link

66
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,510
proprietary the software

67
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,560
and basically some mix of encryption and
security through obscurity

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
however other said we focus here on

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,980
academia and here security

70
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,540
is Austin not present sometimes

71
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,159
I really have to say some satellite and
some satellites still have reasonable

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,010
security

73
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,920
day use either group that link or are
dedicated lanes

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,520
I will talk about us in a few minutes a
little bit more however

75
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,020
the main question which I had when I
started to work was cute

76
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,180
that's as why in the heck as

77
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,380
no one caring about security so

78
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,159
I wrote a little bit in this field and
travel to a conference and spoke with

79
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,740
other cute lets people of other
universities and I totally paraphrase

80
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,140
here

81
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,280
but that's kind of a little bit the
spirit

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,780
nobody is going to hurt us so

83
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,510
we all know this works are kind of
strange I mean

84
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,909
nobody was expecting that somebody is
flying to

85
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,000
to meet a wide a.m. temperature control
part

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,570
to get to a nuclear reactor on blow up
the desktop but hey

87
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,290
it happened however there's nobody

88
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,340
is going to hurt us actually has some
too if we're

89
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,719
thinking a little bit more about it this
guy

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,490
down the ass any benefits from packing
cute gift certs

91
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,560
just small satellites doing some
research tasks and

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,690
there's not really a commercial gain of

93
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,719
or taking the cube set so

94
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,980
what kind of attack us are we dealing
with

95
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,310
I don't want to criminalize ham radio
operators here at all

96
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,050
but its in my opinion more reasonable

97
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,080
that people who actually have already is
equipment to communicate with

98
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,560
source tidy satellites called cat a
little bit curious

99
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,950
just char look around what's possible so
it's not really

100
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,490
that we should be afraid that cute thats

101
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,630
I get a overtaken

102
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,190
by harmful people but still it would be
nice to Esther

103
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,800
security so to put it in a little bit
better way

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,000
the cube that security it's about

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,590
costs the product itself I aim to be

106
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,409
more that's no better projects and
buying frequencies for the actual comp

107
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,850
communication is expensive but the other
amateur radio frequencies which are free

108
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,270
to use for everyone who has no moderator
license

109
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,770
and also for satellite complication

110
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,580
the problem years if he is a satellite

111
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,800
is not in service of the amateur radio
community

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,070
you are not allowed to encrypt so

113
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,330
for academic cute sets most of the time

114
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,349
encryption it's not possible and

115
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,450
at sea and from the other side talking
about the cost

116
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,469
an attacker would have to pay quite a
lot of money to actually

117
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,120
gets equipment to attack a cute South
and

118
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,520
the benefits are 80 set so

119
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,659
I already mentioned sometimes of

120
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,560
some cute shirts do half security one
example

121
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,840
I want to mention here is government's
one which was developed by the

122
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,260
University of all

123
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,610
and Denmark and launched and 2013

124
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,960
and they developed a so-called cubes at
space protocol

125
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,549
the stressful to call is own sauce and
that aims to be

126
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,330
a protocol issued to be used in cute

127
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,930
it's really a nice protocol and

128
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,200
it supports fee just like XT a

129
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,170
encryption and counter mode all age make
Shaw one for the message

130
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,840
however up this one methodist by now

131
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,130
is missing replay protection so
basically

132
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,450
if we communicate with a satellite even
if it is a group that

133
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,780
week or just eavesdrops a message and
replay it

134
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,690
let's get to the second part

135
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,950
for everyone who was not a.m.
remembering star wars and other bar

136
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,469
was the planet well lou actually got his
training

137
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,060
by the Jedi Master Yoda to get like yeah

138
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,480
but when JD and so do I want to talk
about

139
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,680
higher how I got to do with all those
cute

140
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,880
how it started so I what and

141
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,870
with the end did you test satellite
witch's spell it is a cute sup project

142
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,470
also Norwegian University of technology
and sides

143
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,020
where did my master studies

144
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,699
I participated in the project 2013 and
foreign

145
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,520
so a mollusk quite fresh out of the
project

146
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,040
and the full thing actually started
already in 2010

147
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,599
and the lounge of the satellite itself
its planned for 2016

148
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,320
of 17 we're not quite sure about it one

149
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,900
special thing about this fuchs et

150
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,010
in comparison to other Q thats yes

151
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,040
they want to build everything from
scratch most of the future projects

152
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,150
are using at least some commercial
off-the-shelf parts

153
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,970
you not they actually cooked already a
plan designed

154
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,490
hardware design and build

155
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,650
they are communications Dec while using
CSP inside up

156
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,980
and the software all around how the same
time insights a satellite and on the

157
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,630
base station

158
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,920
can also develop either and one

159
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,140
especially for me and written part say
wanted public security they said someone

160
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,670
in 2011 hey we have to look into the
link

161
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,810
it's totally owe so I dot

162
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,290
into the project and looked around and
saw there was already some work done

163
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,199
basically remain insight was

164
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,310
okay weekend encrypt but that's actually
not a problem

165
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,310
we have a scientific payload we're just
takin pictures from the rust and

166
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,079
relaying them back to their us so

167
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,900
it's okay if the communication is open
all what we need

168
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,850
this out education for the uplink free
from the base station send something to

169
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,610
the satellite

170
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,170
we have to be sure that no other base
station can

171
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,870
send comments or satellite we don't want
that somebody is or what

172
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,890
you know satellite so what was already
done

173
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,060
what using the edge met functionalities

174
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,689
of the keeps its base protocol and at

175
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,270
a pending sequence numbers as unit
element

176
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,020
to every message to actually fix the
lack

177
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,339
of repair protection so I can

178
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,250
to the power grid and these solve that

179
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,459
recycling is Asian protocol well

180
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:02,489
little bit worn while so I said okay why
are we using timestamp the satellite

181
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,369
haz a small talk a real time clock on
BART so

182
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:09,429
we could just use this ass unity of
command

183
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:12,499
to prevent replay attacks and

184
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:17,119
then I also said if we are already doing
that we actually don't have to stick to

185
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,649
the cube that space protocol

186
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,809
we can just at our own module a layup

187
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:24,990
and has a security feature sale

188
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,509
instead of dangling around with now
though sauce for

189
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:32,160
so a packet

190
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,660
for knots was then designed to look
something like that

191
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,379
we have X 25 us link1

192
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,679
layup on then we actually

193
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,529
security Walid Asian Atenza to touch
base protocol for routing between the

194
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,259
different compliments of the satellite

195
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,779
and then the actual payload ass

196
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,329
out indication control I just said okay

197
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,769
the satellite ascending as broadcasting
the timestamp

198
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:02,860
all all day all around the time

199
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,119
in their beacon message the base station
snatch in this time stamp

200
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:10,259
constructing the age make from

201
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,360
message that wants to send with the time
stand up and not

202
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,279
and fans these three compliments to the
satellite

203
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,170
the satellites and actually verifies
that's the timestamp this wet

204
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,029
so that it's a fresh measures message
and that the edge metals correct

205
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:26,649
construct

206
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:30,110
and if so

207
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,019
attends a response so

208
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,170
after the this was my preliminary
project work

209
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,969
and I decided to take turns on in my
mouth that Jesus not just

210
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,339
sketching it up but doing a little bit
more artsy ridicule and former things

211
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:45,819
with it

212
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:49,189
so democracy this had at the end the

213
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:52,349
topic integration and verification of a
keyed hash

214
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,399
message authentication scheme based on
broadcast timestamp

215
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,050
for knots

216
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,069
so we had swirled verification and their
what

217
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,860
it's where occasions mister I'm not
talking here about software verification

218
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,010
all suitors also an important part no

219
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,680
here it's a formal verification of the
actual cryptographic protocol

220
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,739
our messages are into the exchange is
thus

221
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,950
actual secure the goal obviously is

222
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,130
to assure this correctness to have say
okay all set alight

223
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,530
looks onto our communication protocol
with a satellite looks on

224
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,670
so formal verification a

225
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,060
at sea and former metalitz based on math

226
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,329
and logic to proof that

227
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,490
security property it's like a message
result indicated

228
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,790
a verified to do so they are

229
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,050
out all my tools for example RESPA

230
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,250
or skies a I will talk a little bit
about skies for

231
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,480
and if you want to know more about
formal verification

232
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,770
I recall my and to look up the need to
ensure it a protocol

233
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,880
which was published in 1978

234
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,050
and in ninety 95

235
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,370
lawful came up and with

236
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,530
metalitz a formal verification and shot

237
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,050
that's protocol actually had a problem
and

238
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,120
so said it sounds and the term schroeder
protocol

239
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,510
is still commonly used to test different
formal verification matter

240
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,380
got kind of a punching bag so

241
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,330
out indication we want to authenticate

242
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,760
on my search and to verify that its
oughtn't

243
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,010
get however what is out indication
exactly

244
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,680
I mean if I say other indication
everybody hasta grasp about what it is

245
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,420
but everything cloth about it its

246
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,400
can have different aspect for example

247
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,030
a life nurse as defined by over in 1997

248
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,240
is just when

249
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,540
one complication player

250
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,630
part is exchanging messages with another
or receiving messages from

251
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,540
nother the other one doesn't have
necessarily to know that it was

252
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,790
communicating was a

253
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,569
just sends a message and know it arrive
somewhere

254
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,410
and a at sea and just know that

255
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,860
the be part of the communication is
somewhere around

256
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,750
that it's not bot it doesn't say

257
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,470
that be no thought that was
communicating with a this

258
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,370
actually fixed as far as actually fixed
by week agreement for example

259
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,140
they are a and be a knowing that they
are

260
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,560
actually communicate with each other
that s no man in the mirror for example

261
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,290
and then we can also bring in

262
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,430
a set of data and then we can also say
okay

263
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,209
we want that though both

264
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:57,349
ANP are agreeing on the data that they
are correct

265
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,459
i mean they could communicate with each
other and say hey

266
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,040
yes I'm definitely communicating with
the other part

267
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,279
but the data I don't know if they are
correct or say got em but on the Travel

268
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,770
during the transfer and this kind of
agreement over a set of data

269
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,670
is called non-object if agreement and
the context a formal verification

270
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,339
so this was just a short introduction

271
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:27,060
and now to the automated tools I used to
dream of the Cedars

272
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,609
skies a which is developed by cuts cream
us a professor at the University of

273
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,300
Oxford

274
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,540
and in comparison to other tools

275
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,660
it has served very easy input language a

276
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,900
comprehensible easy accessible it in
general relatively

277
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,310
easy or intuitive what intuitive to use

278
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,010
and also in comparison to other tools

279
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,450
its efficient so I puts a protocol

280
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,320
us seen before into skies are and came
out with us

281
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,670
we see several web message was read
mothers are not good

282
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,899
we have failed so the protocol

283
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,220
is obviously slot so

284
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,950
what to do

285
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,060
I said okay in this case even so

286
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,649
this protocol is in Syria horrible

287
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,880
not working even it look kind of okayish
we can use it

288
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,600
anyway because if we go back and look

289
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,919
what the actual feel us where r they are

290
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,190
on the base station side the base
station cannot

291
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,820
out indicates a satellite it cannot say
that it was right now communicating with

292
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,530
a satellite

293
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,960
but first of all

294
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,880
we can do academic and so we wanted to
do public security

295
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,010
not only security so this problem is
outside the scope of this work

296
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:54,740
I'm the list possible but not really a
nice answer to this problem

297
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,510
and stuff we can say we just assume
that's a satellite as a trusted entity

298
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,410
the probability that someone is putting
up fate satellite

299
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,080
210 power base station is raise a law
again here

300
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,639
it's about the cost and the risk and be
such that

301
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,240
I mean the other way we're just being on
the right and trying to communicate with

302
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,080
the base station

303
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,250
we have through the fast moving
satellite in space

304
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,800
a phenomenal a physical phenomena called
Doppler shift

305
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,340
which as actually kind of

306
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,740
physically out indicating that the
message we received

307
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,730
came out of space if we will receive was
our equipment

308
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,030
a message from the ground it will be
readable

309
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,139
and it's not possible to reproduce it

310
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,790
easy unless you can drive a car with AQ
made up for a second

311
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,810
and send messages to us that will be

312
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,480
impressive so the implementation

313
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,810
just shot shot look on the

314
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,980
development environment I used I had a
small real time clock

315
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,380
hooked up a lie to see two were
evaluation kit

316
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,510
fear with this we as read which is using

317
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,990
the same areas 32-bit me a process to us

318
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,000
our satellite and yet ever

319
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,080
area drayton the back to so what do we
see here

320
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,600
it's really low cost the development
area

321
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,879
is not expensive all those together

322
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,530
so possible most expensive part what's
the real time clock

323
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,809
so the smileys tiny thing to the left

324
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:35,830
after the implementation

325
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,059
on the in relation to it hide

326
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,750
run some tests and locked how

327
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,510
dude on how fast it is for us to fall so
ordered occasion

328
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,840
takes between three 25 Micra seconds

329
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,189
which was quite okay and them we have

330
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,480
the problem that we need due to the

331
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,909
transportation to lead before between
ground in space

332
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:03,299
we need a tolerance for the timestamp we
can just not

333
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,900
directly say yep the timestamp us
definitely

334
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,799
of 11 second precision correct we have
to use a tolerance

335
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,879
and sends the packet can have different
sizes also the transportation type

336
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,450
device

337
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,909
so actually run a test and looked home
any replace

338
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:23,840
a possible you in a small period of time
and

339
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,320
a smaller-than-expected if the packet
size a small

340
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,590
we can replace the packet a lot of time
into a great will be accepted

341
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,320
however the earth

342
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,850
is also the team not beautiful I agree
on that

343
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,730
but it's okay because we can hear

344
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,450
say that the Commons

345
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,860
which I'll small don't

346
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,168
really affect the satellite state if
they are

347
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:57,130
executed two times behind each other now

348
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,530
the so apart what I learned and what I
want two cents per share with you

349
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,799
the moral of the story every ferret
early tomorrow if it is

350
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,460
bring not the walls to your grandmother
crypto was hot

351
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,110
be already know that nothing you however

352
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,158
crypt on space as hard a we have

353
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,460
some problems we don't have on us

354
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,409
we do have in space for example random
bit flip securing

355
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:27,890
cost by space radiation so insert a
memory

356
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,440
one bit just randomly gets flipped
inward

357
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,610
and

358
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,330
we somehow have to deal with it and I'll
can't for example

359
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,059
timbre cryptographic keys or altercation
go

360
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,290
than we have compared to

361
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,649
the white house on the rock salt you
that relies on earth reso computational

362
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,130
power

363
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,380
the link for J a small we cannot send

364
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,290
a lot a lot of things in a short period
of time

365
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,620
we have actually to kill off third

366
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,830
whatever we're doing without a detention
court and so on that's over head of the

367
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,939
message was not

368
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,850
getting too big so that it will be an
official inefficient to communicate

369
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,830
and then the last saying I

370
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,750
yet nor less discover not discovered but

371
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,400
which was bugging me people which are
developing

372
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,450
satellites and 12 wanting to do security

373
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,740
kind of paranoid they don't want to get

374
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,919
lot out at any case I mean its it's
totally comprehensible

375
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,260
I put up a satellite in space I don't
want

376
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,799
that I by myself cannot communicate so

377
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,990
I'm I guess a lot of

378
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,520
satellites actually do have packed or by
design

379
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,240
and which was way they are called

380
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,970
pain and stiffness in this case to half
metal to communicate with a satellite

381
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,679
even evert if that normal hot indication
way all

382
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,910
security way fails in our case and the
knots project

383
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:06,640
resource the issue by having to radios
one radio is just a really

384
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,100
out indicator traffic and the other
radio

385
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,309
just except all traffic but is not used
by default

386
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:18,970
so if you know the frequency of the
other radio you baby when

387
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,450
then my second insight

388
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,460
from verification is awesome the
protocol

389
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,809
when I it is I'm doing my project at
work I said hey that's that's a pure

390
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:34,899
look good it looks good it looks like
it's doing the things

391
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:38,428
I wanted to do but former vacation

392
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:41,710
easily show me I its its loss

393
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:47,010
it's totally flawed and with tools like
skies I would say

394
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,500
formal verification even so it comes
from academia

395
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,640
it doesn't have to be limited to
academia

396
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,230
we call probably use it also for up
protocols

397
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,260
redesign and in fact also

398
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,679
for example the internet key exchange
protocol between

399
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,799
at bean rarefied by former verification
that it's working quite fine

400
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:12,179
and as we know in crypto the
implementation

401
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,549
can be very insecure I actually screwed
up the implementation

402
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:21,779
for my nuts project as well so might be
better to have a sound design from the

403
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:22,270
beginning

404
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:29,039
them md5 if you look at the flights
before

405
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,740
I wealth from talking about using

406
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,490
age make and the five and we all know
and the FIFPro and we showed you that

407
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,480
today anymore

408
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,529
but its okay someplace we just have to
know

409
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:45,000
in which context he hoped that was used
and comp

410
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,029
combination with sage make

411
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,840
a tourism an edge made itself the
security of air to make does not rely on

412
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,220
the

413
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,990
underlying hash function than we have

414
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:00,860
according to literature when it to to
the power of sixty four tries

415
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,029
to restore a key from aged a

416
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:09,659
it's Matt and the five we have to listen
to a 2-2 the power 65 metres

417
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,500
sorry however others are not set alight
is just

418
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,740
exchanging was expected to exchange to
to the power of 16 messages during its

419
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,250
lifetime

420
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,659
so we aren't not hitting the strange by
far

421
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:26,049
and the other atlanta's

422
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:29,260
and thus small computational power up

423
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,158
and why minders and the five has a small
dick just sigh so it thousand enqueso

424
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:34,999
wet

425
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:38,519
and its relatively fast to compute
however

426
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,019
I want to stress out I'm not and I'm
definitely not saying and the five

427
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:46,649
all the saints just know your
constraints

428
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:50,809
unanimity on YM and and look if you're
sometimes maybe

429
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:54,570
also have to use a greater weaker
cryptographic

430
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,879
hash function my last insight

431
00:25:57,879 --> 00:26:01,149
academic projects which shop mainly
driven

432
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:05,458
by students a hard to coordinate I was
not on the part of the coronation

433
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:09,209
part I sought by myself everyone

434
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:13,429
is calming you to the product and
process for wants to change everything

435
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:17,199
want to change the world so did I i said
okay there a sequence number

436
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:21,129
let's go for types and that's that why
it because a student you are young and

437
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:22,089
you want to

438
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:25,940
you want to have some impact and do
something on your own and not just

439
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,949
taking things other did before

440
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:33,589
and just re during it so

441
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:37,190
however someone what's your own at

442
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,049
just going to be a rush for deadlines
you just want to

443
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:44,658
deliver the report delivered the mat-su
North you

444
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:47,719
want to get finished as soon as possible

445
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:51,299
and after wats you probably like me

446
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,079
I want to master feels and left the
project I'm still communicating with

447
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,440
them

448
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,999
but for example now the person worth

449
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:02,679
curable with continuing the secret just
came you

450
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,519
to the project and looked at my security
solutions that hey

451
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,599
the protocol is flawed we can probably
do something better

452
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,689
so also now he is now

453
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:19,279
changing so I will he assailed the
continuity of the project the selected

454
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,369
people are exchanging people have new
ideas

455
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:25,978
pond it's not all it's hard to get

456
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:29,259
a finished product here and yeah

457
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:32,749
procrastination a problem a lot

458
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:35,849
or at least I have I think a lot of I
love has as well

459
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:40,389
earth also he is strong I think the
original

460
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:43,968
large for the not set alight was planned
for

461
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:46,640
to sell 13 or 14

462
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,550
now we are off by only three or four
years how

463
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,970
all the time however this is all

464
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,780
totally okay in this context it's not a
problem cute sluts

465
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,760
its manned to PF students a possibility

466
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,550
to work was space technology and those
contacts

467
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:09,310
and but works fine the sweat so

468
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,659
we almost done just the

469
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,690
rock which is ongoing right now the

470
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,970
all security solution has to be
integrated

471
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,870
to the actual knots Hartwell to the
actual microcontrollers on the satellite

472
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,530
it has to be tested against radiation
asset base trips

473
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,750
and Jan of course when it is in space

474
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,800
has to be a test operation and show

475
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,850
if it is working and if so we possibly
helped a little bit academic community

476
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,969
and one very important problem we

477
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,610
don't have faced by now is key
management

478
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,439
how are we manage and key in space and
why am and where things can corrupt and

479
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,510
we can't really reliable safe sex

480
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,690
so do we want to have really keen

481
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,580
algorithms how do we protect them and
support all

482
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,419
and one personal portraits I wanted to I
talked

483
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,800
to the developers of the queue its base
protocol and

484
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,970
maybe we can also integrate more
security light

485
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,200
replay protection fixed Anza CSP

486
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,890
so last but not least I want to thank

487
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,800
a few people first of all the hat and
coordinator

488
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,960
of so knots project Rajab local and

489
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,910
crew did who does an amazing job with
keeping all the students together with

490
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,250
all the different ideas

491
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,660
and just change and keep the product
still running and getting funding every

492
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,230
year

493
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,380
and than I want to thank stick for a
master's

494
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,290
my professor who was supervising them
after three years

495
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,610
father more too much time

496
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:53,740
a friend of mine who with like at every
hour I can call him in T

497
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,810
looks at my slides talks with me about
ideas and

498
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:02,460
than some groups of course the team that
for not steam

499
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:09,460
and my CTS Tim tasteless sex we have
time for two questions

500
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,960
if there are any okay

501
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:26,440
I

502
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,940
things to for the nice presentation I am
instantly used to or for some projects

503
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,770
which

504
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:37,430
look into ideas be security via air
traffic controllers and their

505
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,270
airplanes topics misty they

506
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,389
issue vase also lean budget the mcveigh
can manage man

507
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,400
Solvay

508
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,630
beats corruption and so on are you and
like leave

509
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,510
our source like made its to

510
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,450
some people to create different for the
holes and different government

511
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,700
initiatives to create some standards are
you

512
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,510
trying to incorporate some opposed to
standards or they think it's a good idea

513
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,900
it's a bad idea to take from let's say I
R traffic controller

514
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,580
standardization or implementation Air
Force and bring something to keep that

515
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,030
or 2i matter

516
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:15,160
satellites because is somehow related
but is not exactly the same league so

517
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,260
miss Micah personal opinion yeah of
course urban

518
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,510
weaker no academia ncube thats return

519
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,990
surely also learn from these systems

520
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,130
however we r kind of aiming to do

521
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,930
research and having something novel with
the things we are doing

522
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,380
so it might be that a lot of things we
are all

523
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,540
what what I did or what people do in
this just not used at all let on

524
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,780
but a small percent of things done in
research

525
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,790
actually getting on taken on to the real
world let alone

526
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,820
and I think that's very important that
it works

527
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,879
both west so that's a real world from
the part

528
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,240
part wise can inspire academia and

529
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,450
academia can break things to the real
world worth

530
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:08,450
enough to one more question

531
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,009
you're saying something about slim
chances a

532
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:22,070
having a fake supplied what about
something that comes between

533
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,039
your satellite then your signal so

534
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,729
probably in other objector that can

535
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:33,159
interfere arm

536
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,340
even another satellite

537
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,658
I'm yet its totally possible I agree on
that

538
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:45,389
I mean well what a third with no
possible or what a bed with a low

539
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:47,449
probability of perfect satellite earth

540
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,139
that's a possibility that someone
targeted as putting up

541
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:56,090
a satellite to to power base stations
radar like the of course there are

542
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,009
different source

543
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,759
with other satellites and during q2
launchers

544
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,919
at happen quite often that one satellite
just got in the shadow of another one it

545
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,929
was not reachable

546
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:10,830
for so yep second cutie those

547
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,299
quite set but it happens and we

548
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:19,499
well I come on really do much in the
mold made about this right now

549
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:23,450
okay

550
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,090
than thank you so much for the
presentation
