1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,380
would like to welcome the first keynote
who is the

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,050
vice president of us is the hash
communications security

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,860
so let's give some hands of a plus to me

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,860
mister B cup okay

5
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:35,040
perhaps this is about their so the next
for the meantime we'll be using a

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,559
valuable

7
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,599
by to explain something about their the
crypt dot and

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,270
as you know that that our company
inventing SSH protocol but not most not

9
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,280
everybody's knowing that there is a
company actually behind the whole thing

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,270
what I will be also explaining is that
that's how we were doing it

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,570
what the state the future what we are
seeing how we are tackling

12
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,469
beings and which which other things
which happen inventing crypto

13
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,960
and these kinda things happening in the
world and

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,189
in the later in the evening I will be
taking a

15
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:07,470
second talent that challenge exit the
explaining about that

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,500
jealousies which we on he dating
actually from snowed in for the whole

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,119
europe

18
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,220
so the seasonal presentation which it
more technical

19
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,450
I won't be going the details in all how
to keep the air

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,479
there ppl a mine key exchange is
happening

21
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,740
or anything like that but something I
will be dealt telling

22
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,919
how we are we are doing and what are the
issues toys

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,180
anybody hacking my mouth just now okay
yet so

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,390
happy doing this work already more than
15 years

25
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,500
and traveling around the planet than
explaining for the government's how they

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,960
should be protecting the information
security and last 10 years had been

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,390
concentrating quite a lot

28
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,990
for for the Europe and European
Commission and and and

29
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,449
dad different elements in the in the
inside Europe

30
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,770
but this is not really a speech on
behalf of

31
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,949
Europe neither against anybody but the
set speech about that the crypt

32
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,950
doc all these things with I'm

33
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,098
will be explain please consider those
assets as my personal opinion so that

34
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:08,478
their

35
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,690
their I'm not able to speak on behalf of
commission or anybody else the shop

36
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,490
just things which are we are seeing this
company happening

37
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,989
so if we are going back

38
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,840
in the eighties nope encryption or
starting from with the popular shows how

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,810
you are putting the population around 8%

40
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,830
all around and this dick at these worse
you know

41
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,110
something which was enough on those days

42
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,690
all right during his keys are at last
bus inventing something a bit more

43
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,540
more advanced we were happy seeing
enigma coming and going

44
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,560
and of course that that with a knee but
we're also learning that when making

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,510
this gonna proprietary solution they
bite be also failing miserable away

46
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,010
but hey history has been going on scenes

47
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,459
and there has been a huge amount of
different and I don't get just which has

48
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:55,850
been

49
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,920
coming and going but what is that the
chains actually

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,130
fundamental changes that people are not
anymore trust for this gonna make a

51
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,000
nickel things

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,519
we are now in the Internet time and
which it meaning

53
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,519
that it's a protocols encryption
libraries

54
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,100
containers which i doing the job soap

55
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,980
how this whole thing was starting
actually worse

56
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,078
1995 meant Apple learning the founder of
the company

57
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,190
what's working at the university in
Helsinki

58
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,209
and and one day when he was connected
that the mainframe computer

59
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,019
in day in the University somebody was
hacking his connection did the computer

60
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,970
so he got so upset that he decided that
he will be preventing is happening

61
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,730
so you're starting to develop into SSH
that was actually they

62
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:52,108
the start of basis H but story wouldn't
be totally complete without actually

63
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,230
mentioning all sat down

64
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,959
the we mop who was his fellow colleague
in day in the university and of course

65
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:58,299
that

66
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,549
he was cheering himself by hacking that
battles SSH protocol in several ways

67
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,630
on thing you know Apple had to hire day
on

68
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,959
the for the company to make the next
generation SSH

69
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,019
so the boys both guys are still working
for the company

70
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,970
after all these fifteen years they are
still developing that this Houston

71
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,789
and you know after solving this initial
theme connecting

72
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,930
two dots in the internet without

73
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,240
having possibility for interference must
only a starting point for the whole

74
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,750
thing

75
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,830
soul we invent that the SSH protocol

76
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,620
we were also given that that's a fee at
resource-poor for everybody

77
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,690
but in the meantime we were also
developing

78
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,659
our own proprietary ss8 so that there's
a there's open SSH which is still

79
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:51,770
hier utilized in more than fifty percent
of all that a web service in this planet

80
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,198
batman & it can be found from everything
Linux Unix and and so on

81
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,659
but we also having all our own
proprietary system for which we are

82
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,669
developing for

83
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,430
lets a more advanced users but I will be
coming that

84
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,970
and that the reason for that a bit later
nowadays

85
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,460
we up company having a several offices
around the planet

86
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,169
all that he will open is happening in
Finland there's a good reason for that

87
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:21,840
and of course that that we are having
more than 3,000 customers while using

88
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,929
using currently our products the reason
why you are not necessary

89
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,370
seeing this happening in the round the
air around you is that that

90
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,590
usually our customers are in the
priciest governments

91
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,359
and of course that we are having a lot
of con compact customers

92
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,130
which %uh confidential which is meaning
that there are governments military's

93
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,979
and so on which I using our technology
saw

94
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,279
this has been going on already years

95
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,370
but I know I will be explaining that
what how how that

96
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,300
whole thing is is put together soap the
crypto East

97
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,840
of course that the main thing which is
here up it's good understand its

98
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,989
many very buying anything of the whole
product good

99
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,400
good clip kept the crowd graphic ice are
not taking 12 years before they are

100
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,318
level that they i'd

101
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,729
really able to produce good cryptography
it takes roughly two to three years

102
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,710
before you I'm a level that that except
average program in you can

103
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,539
utilize the cryptographic libraries and
implement those

104
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:27,130
the or your source code so which is
meaning that you know

105
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,319
you have to expect 2010

106
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,839
12 years before you are able to gets the
gets these guys

107
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,369
which I now currently doing the crypto

108
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:40,270
but don't worry a iraq lot of this kind
of

109
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,779
available things in dade

110
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,308
got in the crypt area what you can use
however its

111
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:51,229
30 to understand that they are not he'd
end the call

112
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,109
so like I've been away saying that that
when we are dealing with the script

113
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,729
libraries is that that you have should
be understanding like

114
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:02,558
in USA none of these are allowed to be
handled the classified three

115
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:06,330
secret data actually there is no one
want this kind of

116
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,539
act at the library which is allowed to
be utilized care for the sick ESET

117
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:15,719
data in USA but on average those things
which we on debt discussing publicly

118
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,759
at are not soul which shop

119
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,289
considered as a bulletproof but

120
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,860
as I was saying that the clip place a
tiny Pratt getting off the whole product

121
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,860
which meaning that

122
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,110
you have to build the group the first
then you opt been making

123
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,119
application you are generating a
hardware issue are installing that

124
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,719
customer environment which is

125
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:41,659
many times legacy in a by AM and spend
and at the worst cases oxley the banks

126
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,779
and these kinda things when

127
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,740
you ask Frankie drop this kind of latest
technology

128
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,469
on the top of the old shit and operating
system environment

129
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:56,569
so we are also having guys were up in
programming 45 years chip OS

130
00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:00,769
and they are still working in our
company but of course that that

131
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:04,149
so date tiny dot there in is the crypto

132
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:08,240
and you are building a lot of things
around that so

133
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,959
weaver the link this Secure Shell and

134
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,039
we were able to connect it to do things
in the net

135
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,860
internet we were also able to dated to
connect and transferred them at every

136
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,259
hour

137
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,069
in peace these kinda creeped up on als
now the question is that that

138
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:29,719
what happy at cheating actually today
they're sick going to be presentation

139
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,248
with I'm also waiting is that

140
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:34,849
SSH tunneling a gated a freedom or Treat
and actually

141
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,569
I need to already pretty empty dis dis
presentation in this said and agreed to

142
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:38,889
cuss

143
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:43,579
it's absolutely true through that that
the perception of

144
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:46,620
encryption is many times making it the
biggest failure

145
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,490
on the whole system

146
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,650
so actually when making

147
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:55,579
is gonna panels encryptions we have been
generating actually a big hurdle for our

148
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,100
self

149
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,150
actually we are now generating talents

150
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,120
soul this is taking a picture from

151
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,910
one real environment actually one of our
customers always having one hundred

152
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,780
twenty thousand computers in his systems

153
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,850
alright and all these lines

154
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,840
I and group that tunnels great I we say

155
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,610
actually we have been generating a huge
challenge what what I'm

156
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,740
who are calling that that you have been
losing the keys

157
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,740
because its enough many times that you
are able to pick up

158
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,560
one SSH key wanna certificates and
actually

159
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,939
you can compromise the whole network so
you have been

160
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,280
going from is gonna security tunneled
environment

161
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,430
unsecure environment where you have been
losing most of the keys

162
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,989
so you don't know how many users there
are

163
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,090
where they opt what they are doing where
they are heading

164
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,210
%uh they transferring them at the
material out or in

165
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:59,790
and and so on ok actually not the
situation is even worse than

166
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,449
in the beginning a course that the fuel
having only 21 computer on one

167
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,040
shiver you can steal consider that you
are somehow

168
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,089
getting piecing creep you understanding
what is happening

169
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,110
but when there's hundreds of thousands
machines actually you are lost

170
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,570
so what is the in reality happening is
that that

171
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,800
only let's say twenty percent of the
user's

172
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,550
the usually the company's understanding
what traveling in the network's

173
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,680
an eighty percent 80% of two of the keys
and

174
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,420
access controls are totally lost what

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,459
actually took NSA and snowed in

176
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,190
to put up in the headlines biggest as
you know that's no Thomas using this

177
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,300
these key trick as well pulling out at
the data

178
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,839
from there in SA servers but all signed
a similar way an essay West using date

179
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,690
that the keys

180
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,150
to pull out the information from the
European systems great deal

181
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,829
so but we have been discussing these

182
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,270
already more than 10 years because you
know when we were inventing

183
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,910
basis age we were also see

184
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,819
that this is going to happen so we were
trying to push

185
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,590
this to that day and that the friend
placees

186
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,410
like if different kind of needs to stand
out

187
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,550
but it wasn't really needing an essay
and

188
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,770
snowed in before actually in use for
saying that alright

189
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,329
guys you are really having a point the
key seems to be tricky

190
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,800
for this whole encryption so

191
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,040
we have been invented this comes to stem
where can a form one single place

192
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,010
you can control all the keys in the
system's not only keys but certificates

193
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,480
as well

194
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,370
so that that that you can travelgate

195
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,010
first you get what you can do is that
you can monitor and find the keys in the

196
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,780
whole systems and a course that that are
saying that if they're set

197
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,589
there's there's two hundred thousand
machines you can but you can find

198
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,840
millions of keys in the system's what
you can or someone he thought that that

199
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,910
who are those users while using does who
are doing that

200
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,569
unauthorized operation a nice we have
been seeing the real life

201
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,080
there had been discovered several people
we out which have been leaving the

202
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,900
company

203
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,220
and which have been still keeping the
connection in the mainframes

204
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,510
but of course we can also look down

205
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,950
that they're all unnecessary keys and
certificates so that we can block

206
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,640
that that in the future these kinda
things are not happening and of course

207
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,230
that that

208
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,370
weekend anymore all these obsolete and
accys

209
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,650
and then after all these

210
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,829
we get started finally to manage an
automated waited that that its

211
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,410
systems so making

212
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,780
day at that the encryption he making
that paneling

213
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,589
its peace only getting that the things
worst but then he'll have to do

214
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,420
something

215
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,530
it didn't quite get all these con on
things

216
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,750
on under control and you might be

217
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,300
already now thinking that I happy now
solving the issue

218
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,920
but actually now actually there it's not
enough steel

219
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,280
with the this kind of things so there's

220
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,709
what we are calling prohibited content
there's always prohibit content

221
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,410
you know banks are concerned that that
now when they are happy to finally

222
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,890
making this cup panels

223
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,370
what is going inside these tunnels
alright the banks are seeing

224
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,339
card numbers and operators top lad

225
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,250
wishing that there wouldn't be any any
type on a crappy and all these kind of

226
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:22,790
things

227
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,319
but now when you are having a pummeling

228
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,570
you having encryption our with you I
proceed through these tunnels

229
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:37,160
soul we have been inventing to state
what we are calling cryptology and

230
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,819
before going any further you know you
might be already thinking that

231
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,800
hate this is man in the middle attack
but the peace

232
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,939
it is man in the middle attack so what
we have been doing is that we have been

233
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,430
inventing system so that that we are
able to

234
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,939
see through the crypt tunnels what is
going inside

235
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,640
there it took much more actually afford
to make that

236
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,720
in the working the way so that that only
the legal

237
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,020
owner of the network is seen through the
encrypt tunnels

238
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,470
not so that that everybody's seen
through they encrypt tunnels

239
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,870
but its this is giving is kinda very
interesting features

240
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,500
what we have BC like when

241
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,560
you want in the real-time stop some
company in the network's

242
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,209
currently we are capable to do it do it
do take and monitor

243
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,430
date they ate them connections with the
speed of 40 gigabit per

244
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,550
second so in the speed we can

245
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,319
stop all these things in the real-time
which shop how wearing

246
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,770
around in this encrypt networks
independently Peter Weir's

247
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,600
unauthorized user obsolete kamande

248
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,300
I'll illegal kamande illegal content.

249
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,939
whatever you like to put their so what
he sees

250
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,110
is it doing is that practical you put
your whole

251
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,450
I the Holy See in the system

252
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,800
and saying that these are the guys while
out to eat a traveling my networks

253
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,939
the south the content which I allowed to
traveling my networks

254
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,640
these are the times when they %ah like a
lot allowed to do these

255
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,550
and these are the things where they are
allowed to do and with this is where

256
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,990
they are not allowed to go

257
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,020
and the whole system is working
automatic medically

258
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:24,149
and seen true that I'm not systems

259
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:26,520
at this is actually how's it looking
like

260
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,560
so I've been away explain that this is
this is like a back

261
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,689
black box in there in the air bright
airplane so that when they are crashing

262
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,730
you can take that this system and you
can check what was the last thing what

263
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,460
was happening

264
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,820
of course I have to admit as well as
that our

265
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,899
guys are using this for our self as well
so that that when we they %uh

266
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,180
programming some huge to stem stay
happening this

267
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,390
on and if the whole system is failing
bad way

268
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,410
and they have seen the replay with the
slow motion

269
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,819
how did we do it how we work able to
crash there the customer systems

270
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,750
but you can't really see what is going
inside there

271
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,420
and how the content is looking like but
the sourcing that that

272
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,060
more interesting things the start being
for example on the BIOS

273
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,540
inside encrypt at tunnel and not only
defending

274
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,770
the customer environment from outside
alright

275
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,510
now was planning to go it Iran's
explaining

276
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,319
how that the world is changing around
the crypto so

277
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,890
what's known in told you is that that
everybody's monitoring everybody

278
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,910
and what how big companies are currently
acting

279
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,910
what is happening is that almost
everything what companies

280
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,500
is launching now in doing encryption
independently

281
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,850
watsapp if its Microsoft is it easy

282
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,070
Google and so on and the question was
should be

283
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,540
placed here in Europe and now is

284
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,480
everything okay now actually

285
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,089
the situation from the European point
have been sliding actually

286
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,030
innnnnn in wrong direction and I will be
explaining why

287
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,250
let's stock from the basic as you saw

288
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,309
last Thursday they're hoping the sinatra
saying that

289
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,410
in SA will be still having the green
card and a hand

290
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:24,720
alright which is meaning that those
things which have been happening at the

291
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,050
be a past will be also happening in the
future what is happening and I'm

292
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,290
compromising your safety

293
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,000
your obvious course that that dependency
from these data systems which are coming

294
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,500
outside

295
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,060
the European territory I people think
it's gonna front and health fair

296
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,230
from German police there has a picture
to get because what

297
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,300
disease actually meaning that the
dependency from the penis

298
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,360
police from a neon police you get these
kinda information outside

299
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,530
is getting bigger so that that that
which is me that

300
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,020
they have to always good abroad

301
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,639
to get information from those criminals
which shocks with reading you

302
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,730
actually these dependencies slowing down

303
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,260
the safety of in your own con country so

304
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,040
it's not necessary helping you to
protect your privacy and your european

305
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,780
values

306
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,830
but actually it might be turning that
against you and these

307
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,169
already or and this has been used
already in the wrong way so

308
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,770
when you saw this is take pictures
taking couple years ago when their

309
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,950
went dead in West making this first
protect this just in

310
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,900
so the way informing yeah India on

311
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,310
government that they con give any
information for these

312
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,360
guys who are burning shops in the street

313
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,649
because they are considering past these
add requirements

314
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,690
astonishing they would be compromising
the safety of the people

315
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,070
and in the six-day when the riots where
bad

316
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,810
stopping in the in the London the same
company was saying that pay

317
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,530
these countries having the right kind of
democracy now I will be giving

318
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,280
the information actually it's a bad
thing that that these kind of things

319
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,910
are decided outside the borders of the
Europe or your

320
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,310
own country it's also making difficult
for that that the citizens which we got

321
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,600
we shall it be hearing

322
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,340
einon in Europe that to understand am I
doing something wrong because

323
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,590
usually we II need to admit that

324
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,639
I don't know every single debate which
is in the thing is legislation

325
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,870
but however if you are charged by

326
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,179
that they do things from on based on
some other

327
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,140
governments at nag legislation this is
making your

328
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,290
your life rather challenging like a
court I've been taking one

329
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,740
when example went there for these couple
who was planted USA and

330
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,820
and they have been utilizing at route
plan which it routinely

331
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,309
english-language in date with their
account which was considered

332
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:54,490
as a host I'll from date the incoming
country

333
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:59,179
but that their Sep

334
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:02,210
buying for their four-day open source as
well

335
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,380
to an as I was saying that we were
contributing follows

336
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,120
our open SSH by keeping this whole
source court in the beginning

337
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,540
for for internet community but open
source

338
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,080
is now suffering for all the switch is
happening because

339
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,530
as you have been seeing already earlier
at

340
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:25,220
all things like Firefox the browser what
time you personally using

341
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,320
has been all the time attack against the
sky now

342
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,399
compromising systems why are these

343
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,510
yeah I am the doers actually targeting
for these open source is simply because

344
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,720
there is no corporate would be suing
them in court

345
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,070
any countries so it's its it's like easy
target you know

346
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,770
its its it's not fighting back and

347
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,210
now when we have been discussing about
that the heart bleed and we have been

348
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,730
discussing about shell shock

349
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,250
it's a basically the same thing as you
remember heart bleed

350
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,340
actually was infected roughly three
years ago

351
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,010
and the infection what's happening in
their at one

352
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,220
hour before me meet night in in New
Years

353
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,600
evening so who is working in that time

354
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,699
to getting the source called compiled
there in actually shellshock

355
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,540
or liability was there almost free
thirteen years so it's even

356
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,600
longer in that sense so

357
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,219
I have been always saying the that that
that their first three

358
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,190
ways free with like a drug business in
this open source called

359
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,150
so when you are getting one finally get
hooked it's very

360
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,710
difficult sometimes to get out so

361
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,660
don't don't misunderstand this I'm fan
for fall open source

362
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,880
I have been otherwise we shall company
would not have been giving this of

363
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,250
course

364
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,530
at out in the first place but the
challenges that Yukon

365
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,830
now trust for the open source so

366
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,090
open is this a least developed by thirty
people s hobby

367
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,980
okay actually if I want them

368
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,620
is is very clever but you have to
remember that they are doing that

369
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,709
in this paradigm so I would be asking
from you now

370
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,500
when was the last time you study the
source code and where we are combining

371
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,890
that and if you are ok considering all
the time that pay

372
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,880
somebody else is doing that do you know
how many people there are

373
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,210
what thinking exactly the same way when
you are to last for a participating for

374
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,350
open source projects

375
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,389
when did you last time supporting opus
of break

376
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,820
I sewer actually if you are having a
elution

377
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,760
that somebody else is doing that
actually that the open source is the

378
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,770
weakest point because

379
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,600
everybody's them trusting that somebody
else is doing this kind of things

380
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,659
soul there has been speculation that
that's how long actually

381
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,299
what's known these these these holes and
this they'll wait there what they wear

382
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:46,820
their

383
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,409
so the challenges what we are having at
the open source

384
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,960
is that everybody has a basically a
opportunity

385
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,010
infect the source code opportunity
studies the possible weaknesses

386
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,250
there is no real accountability that war
would pay

387
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,280
who is today in this week in charge to
taking care of these kinda things

388
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,389
there's no commitment the guys are doing
that

389
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,230
excellent work by the way they are doing
excellent work but they are doing that

390
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,299
into spare time what they are having
free time from the company

391
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:19,770
Yukon expect that anybody would be well

392
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,090
volunteering and doing so much without
any compensation

393
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,040
there's no real mine finance no
emergency hotline to call

394
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,440
when something goes wrong so so we need
to fix these

395
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,750
we have to beat bring a contribution

396
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,240
now you have my puppy seeing for example
it there have been a

397
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,549
couple a big companies who have been
putting a lot of money now

398
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:47,660
four days open SSL but actually they are
doing that

399
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,320
in certain purpose they have been
utilizing this

400
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,480
open S's for years and years in dade a
commercial products

401
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,980
which has been meeting that it so deeply
implement it that

402
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,100
its easier and much cheaper to keep
couple million for these

403
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,418
is open SSL guys compared that they
would be stopping

404
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,520
picking that the whole essays out from
they products so it's

405
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,840
just pure it is kinda car balance sheet
calculation what they are doing

406
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,020
but we have never saw it

407
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,530
of Fort that that he's gonna open SSH
would be competing with our SSH

408
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,660
because our customers i defriend purpose
utilizing that is different

409
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,220
and we have been saying that at least
everybody should be using the open SSL

410
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,550
but alternate the Swede encryptions

411
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,169
there is seems to be now very
interesting phenomena happening

412
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,270
so at Notre Dame their TrueCrypt West
suddenly got disappearing

413
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:48,120
all what they leave left are ass watched
these kinda in cryptic message

414
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,129
battle it might be totally lopping
nonsense

415
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,660
or than actually two million missus for
us about in SA

416
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,040
but actually the guys I know some of
those guys

417
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,000
way really thread from from these so in
that there's now

418
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,540
discussion in Switzerland that the this
would be going on but of course that

419
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,040
time seeing the same is it

420
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,500
as a disappointed because its meaning
that is kind of cute

421
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,200
crypt dot libraries and the guys who are
working with those

422
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,010
in open source op getting smaller what
we have been also seeing is that

423
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,260
like the message from the true that
there that TrueCrypt people

424
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,430
where bus that everybody should be
moving

425
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,440
in the beat la ca but those who have
been investigating

426
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,550
their windows a recently I don't know if
you have been doing that

427
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,810
we have been spotting axe at least that
that

428
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,919
that beat locker is now removing

429
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,200
or at that they be eddie fisher et
utilisation there

430
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,410
what you mean that sector internal
scrambling is disappearing

431
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,740
and what course that where this is
leading basically is that

432
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,150
if you're having a bit local in your
hard drive you can

433
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,620
replace the whole sick or with your
passwords

434
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,709
from that sector so you don't have to be

435
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,040
even you can utilize your own own
actually password

436
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,430
you are just replacing the whole sector
and you can get

437
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:12,910
in in the system bhakti actually that
that but very clever system when

438
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,310
when we many plus invented but
information security some fortunate

439
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,580
getting political

440
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,139
as well so

441
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,860
Yanis friend of mine from ENISA so he's
working any saying the European

442
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,820
Commission's well

443
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,700
and he will make these kind of statement
about dead dead dead and

444
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,529
day I am encryption which is coming out
of date the European territories

445
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:38,000
but as we all know that there are

446
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,190
even bigger things which are happening
like that ok reineck

447
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,840
nice so what was happening is that that
against the promise to get

448
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,260
couple airplanes and thanks in his is
own home country

449
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,740
then actually these kind of small things

450
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,830
what we are calling cryptography are
suddenly put site

451
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,649
but it would be unfair to complain

452
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:01,870
that all these things what we are having
an and and and

453
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,870
jealousies are coming from outside
actually

454
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,299
you we European cog people also

455
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:11,710
you before these kinda things they're
out these things like

456
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,230
certification happening so actually

457
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,320
their sin 29 member states inane whole

458
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,500
in European Commission an only six of
them

459
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,090
is having right do dish it if you I this
kinda products which are coming to the

460
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,470
european information level

461
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,029
and in line and Romania are not those
who are having to stand up

462
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:35,830
that right but the question is that that
why only seeks

463
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,418
countries are you know more equal than
the other ones

464
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:44,320
so we have to also speaks i said i
things

465
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,820
which is even more question from my
point of view is that

466
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,470
there are certain countries in in Europe
who opt re ceased being

467
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,669
the sky and all advanced or a task for
cities

468
00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:01,299
who would die designated to bring and an
improved the European

469
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:04,440
at cryptography because they are been
considering that

470
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,590
this would be taking some competitive
advantages

471
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,830
away from their from the information
security bundle you

472
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,178
I only see that that actually the
weakest link in Europe

473
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:18,179
stay at their weakest country so
actually what we should be able to do it

474
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:18,500
that

475
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,649
bringing is gonna holistic capability

476
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:26,158
for every single country in Europe

477
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,669
so what we are currently seeing

478
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:32,179
what our citizens are seeing is that
that they rock

479
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,549
to kind of attacks against the European
at information security things

480
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:40,820
does which stop destroying the buildings
totaling

481
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,129
does switch IC leaving that that the
building's totally

482
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,809
intact a course that that if the

483
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:52,750
content with just their inside of the
building is corn actually that they're

484
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,029
them the whole thing equally bad just

485
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:00,210
looking better and of course that when
the dependency of these kind of

486
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,080
operating system firewalls sweet chase
her role

487
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,629
Dennis is coming from one particular
country outside of bed

488
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,250
that the air European territory it also
meet authentically

489
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,110
that those countries while providing
these are always going to have

490
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:19,809
advantage against our governmental
systems which has been leading in

491
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:23,360
several countries for consideration also
in the European Parliament that

492
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,520
should that you're a peon and citizens

493
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,710
have the own operating system my answer
for these

494
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,980
yes I an actual you can build also it is
gonna things like what we are calling

495
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,740
cryptography capabilities

496
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,870
easy round apostles but

497
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,928
as I was saying that that group dice it
dangers assets

498
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:48,760
even some European countries are
considering that and of course that we

499
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,950
on knowing that that

500
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:53,620
there are discussion that even that
portion have

501
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,529
cryptography in the hands it allow to
everybody

502
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,110
or is it only like a weapons of mass
destruction

503
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,289
limited dissident said areas but

504
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:08,640
day interest has been writing all the
time so that that

505
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,760
this is by the way email from from last
week from I like the guys who are saying

506
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,149
that

507
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:16,979
yes we opt target of date they ate them

508
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,200
that is kinda pocket in yen at Dec once
again

509
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,080
I feel we're seeing that you know pretty
sure sign of KBB

510
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,210
what is happening because if if all

511
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,370
the time our firewalls are you know
being in this kind of things it means

512
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,120
that that

513
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,889
that that that we have to be important
company otherwise

514
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,110
there wouldn't be this can attacks

515
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:41,679
by the course I also also see that that
be careful in all men behind their like

516
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,660
ap if you have been seeing what was
happening this week so that you might

517
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,710
think mystery man

518
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,210
making this gonna report that he region
and

519
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,570
actually it's not so new thing it has
been

520
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,909
hanging around stopping 2003

521
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:01,050
but up actually doctor seeks to it that
has seven what West getting

522
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,330
more famous and finally it now sits
among the quest is gonna report

523
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:09,000
its interesting that's DC who are those
targets where it has been port

524
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,010
and this time for for first time a happy
seeing that

525
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,320
there has been at program which has been
targeted

526
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,870
for the cryptography people do to get
the information from

527
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,120
a systems so even in the individual
email level these kind of people I now

528
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,760
see

529
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,620
as a valuable target RBC's piece of the
couple couple watch

530
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,419
screenshot from my PC so this was
happening

531
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,800
couple weeks ago someone one obviously
one

532
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,530
state player West attacking against my
my PC so that

533
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,080
don't bother to hack my PC you know
every time when I'm going back home you

534
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
know it will be

535
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,139
replaced by two hard real hard drive so
that that

536
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,350
when we r anyway estimate that somebody
has been clever enough

537
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,659
but of course that that I need them say
that its beat on knowing

538
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,370
traveling around seeing these kinda
things happening and that the last time

539
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,280
with what also I was able to see

540
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,940
the real-life is that somebody was
opening the big locating my

541
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,350
my PC at remotely so that that

542
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,189
yes the guys are getting better it seems
to be that this is common

543
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,190
is gonna common fun and there are more
players

544
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,130
he in this area but

545
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,030
in the cryptography any information
security it's good to understand this

546
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:26,750
frost is everything ok and of course
that that which is where even

547
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,890
about valuable file company's debt that
the people are trusting and and a and

548
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,710
and AM

549
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:34,910
at what we are doing the this is one of
the reason

550
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,350
by the way for the location why we also
located in Finland because our

551
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,010
legislation is prohibiting

552
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,010
authorities asking any backdoor any
cooperation in this camp is gonna feel

553
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,640
so that that

554
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,890
they conned com to me at anything which
would be

555
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,970
controversial 34 that date the company's
own principles

556
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,540
salt the safe location is is one of
those so

557
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,990
consider if I would be going out and
saying liked it that the score CEO

558
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,090
that that here Finnish president stop
packing my things

559
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,520
what do you believe that anybody outside
Finland

560
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,420
or inside Finland would be purchasing
our products but it's amazing that that

561
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,010
these kinda things are happening and the
guys asking surviving zog I would be

562
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,220
saying that this is Cassy of rather
brave one

563
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,810
because he was saying that that that I
was thinking at I'm having

564
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:26,909
he's got talents at also equally I'm
seeing that those customers what they

565
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,870
steal by buying cease call

566
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,899
are somehow suspicious white and

567
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,510
they are knowing because the CEO has
been informing Scott more challenging

568
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,360
day systems

569
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,550
or that they're set something else which
is

570
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,580
you know making this happen but of
course that that

571
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,669
when the group by stopping by there of
course the search

572
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:49,720
for alternatives is also it also getting
better at the South Hills light from an

573
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,260
essay

574
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,629
things the main thing is that these were
already done

575
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,610
2000 8 and now what we have been seeing
the market

576
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,070
to prevent that circumvent a set at this
kinda Ag

577
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,970
siphoning and group top are much more
advanced

578
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,960
so now what what we are seeing is for
example this kind of attacks

579
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,199
against where you are replacing date
they

580
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:16,928
algorithms in your system with something
else so you are thinking that you are

581
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,480
encrypting but actually I'm not
encrypting alright

582
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,990
than we are coming into balance that how
you are preventing this kind of thing is

583
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:28,060
of course that that you walk predicting
what kind of site free is coming out

584
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,250
but this is of course controversially
that you should be making

585
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,060
randomized site putting all the time are
you up

586
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,679
you are balancing between day the good
and bad in this kinda casey's

587
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,330
box the next step

588
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,840
is coming and how we are seeing white

589
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,149
the crypt is now coming more important
than ever before is that

590
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:54,889
everything is going into in getting it
so we have been approach

591
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,009
bite that several companies who have
been asking that you know

592
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,700
I have been inventing a pollster have
been connecting that

593
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,160
doing

594
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,020
and food few few houses later the
understanding that

595
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,390
somebody's else is also able to control
my

596
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,470
might bolster so that beat always going
on when I'm

597
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,970
out that way from the whole so this is
the challenge that that

598
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,290
everybody wants to connect a more
starting from the boy less

599
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,670
smart meters toaster the Internet and
these guys

600
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,840
are not having any understanding about
the information security

601
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,670
so now actually there's a huge bowl
happening that that

602
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,810
how to get these things in creep and

603
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,910
I didn't put just by coincidence this
this

604
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,129
dishwasher in the in the last the thing
in the picture because did also that

605
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,740
their old where we are going like that
they're one of the good guys were saying

606
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,180
that

607
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,520
we'll the spiking on your through your
dishwasher okay

608
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,340
the chalice actually the picture has
been taking

609
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,500
Finland because now what is happening in
Finland everybody wants to have a

610
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,020
IP camera and a whole so the everybody's
putting

611
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,230
I P carrot and they all said that they
are going to their work and showing from

612
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,260
day for that that

613
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,310
look Micah see my living room there

614
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,500

peoples now watching Daily Mirror on the

615
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,490
same time as well

616
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,020
okay so there's a small

617
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,390
things which need to be fix it before
this is these standing there looking

618
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,009
good

619
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,400
but the thing is that there's huge

620
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,800
amount of devices which shot just now
connected to the Internet

621
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,369

light will be issuing the in that part

622
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:34,480
up there and the Internet

623
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,660
and these guys are not having slightest
idea what is happening in this

624
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,098
area so these batiste direction where we
need to go

625
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,570

as system so that

628
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:56,320

siphoning but you are what you are doing

understanding optimal yessum equipments
