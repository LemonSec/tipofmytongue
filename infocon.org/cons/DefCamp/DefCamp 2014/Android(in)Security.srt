1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,389
so let's get started am my name is

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,529
rough stone amaya I'm a postdoctoral
research fellow

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,230
at the University of South Africa which
is and

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,250
in South Africa in am

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,029
Thomas book am I have also for base in
Berlin so which is

6
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,289
makes it very easy to come here am

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:23,590
my researchers actually in the tuzla
texan and

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,990
back traffic mining I to limit
artificial intelligence

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,189
so this when I may need to this is what
I get research money for

10
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,640
am also to network

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,040
and system monitoring I want a book on
this am

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,219
many focusing on the singer am

13
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,590
but this is sort of a hobby and Android
became hobbyists law

14
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,820
am basically when Android came out a
couple of years ago I told everyone look

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,730
don't use it that's really bad so if you
care about security and privacy

16
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,319
this it cannot get cannot be fixed

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,170
zone am but people keep on using that
and even

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,909
like my wife my kids on Nokia Android
very nice

19
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:14,630
saw and if I cannot security enough
would like to help them

20
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,158
the only thing I can do it actually see
what can be done with reasonably

21
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,330
a farce so Exley take the sauce coren

22
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,580
custom build a system where wifey Angie
Pearson cameras not working anymore

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,429
because I removed from the firmness

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,430
it's not really doesn't really work

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,549
am okay am

26
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,869
if you try to look me up I'm no air con

27
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,020
so why I'm no air con that comes from no
air conditioner because I worked

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,798
two years at the University such
specific which is in Fiji

29
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,750
and I have no air conditioner mouse some
was really unhappy about that

30
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,229
that's why no aircon SAR

31
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,509
am I a prepared to talk together with
have a

32
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,530
Brown was a donor list zone hand

33
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,690
um so his interest was more like on the
usability what can be done

34
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,210
which is basically usable and my
interest

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,550
basically is on the Technics Sonam so
unfortunately that was not for not

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,410
funding for two people so I'm here alone

37
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,950
you can find the slides and something
for me I'm

38
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,000
actually preparing a website on this and
lot of my notes

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,820
in properly Britain for me or for find
them and avert a

40
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,100
and right am if you go

41
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,329
to their am an early version of this
talk I gave us a keynote at the Droid

42
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:37,790
com

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,250
the spring so this is an enhanced
version of the talk

44
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,530
and you can find the slights and some
video footage

45
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,540
and am a lot of advice and how to lose

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,120
and and clings am going to end right

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,030
una droid con and then you will find a
link on how to secure your device

48
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,350
you can open that just now and follow
the lecture if you're interested

49
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,890
so am what's the problem

50
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,988
am EU basically have a smartphone you
put all your doubt on that phone you

51
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,350
have your address lists

52
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,079
a.m. whoever you call you have documents
on the air you start

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,459
putting your I'm private keys on the air
if you would like to have secure email

54
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,780
so it's a lot of stuff

55
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,209
on there in phone smear not built am
actually to protect that

56
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,799
am from the beginning because GSM is
broken

57
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,019
have the phone's design is not not for
security we need to build new phones to

58
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:36,200
have secure phones

59
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,458
am okay we have some Linux but then this

60
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,010
some summed up up a running on the Linux
on my android phone just called Android

61
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,870
and that's not built for security
privacy to so its

62
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,090
them in the line of the NSA revelations
last year's

63
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,180
actually using mobile phones in general
a really bad idea

64
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,150
so okay but what can we do so I am

65
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,530
the spring they're worse like your huge

66
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,070
some announcement this that black phone
developed by that

67
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,500
guy who invented pgp so any that

68
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,640
that that phone runs Android at that
time I felt

69
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,140
okay that's really aren't that may build
a secure phone with a

70
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,509
sort of privacy OS but thats end right
that's a

71
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,199
custom Sims Sims on I know that was not
the Sims on the bus but really there are

72
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,410
trip to phone to actually do use the
same zone

73
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,449
ms 2s3 and

74
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:32,650
so they cannot make custom firmware so
they cannot be really really secure

75
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,530
so am so actually you can take you into
a device

76
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,489
and get very close to what the trip to
phone offers

77
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,810
so am let's see arm

78
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,449
the stomach refunds are very expensive
they are around two thousand euro or

79
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,080
the you can get them cheaper but you
have a costly subscriptions

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,419
they're not necessary compared
comfortably was a very few wanna be

81
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:00,389
built a cute

82
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:03,789
good trip to phone draw only work with a
good crew performs

83
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:07,150
from the same vendor that's a problem a
so

84
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,909
and key problems who do you want to
trust we learnt

85
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,030
I'm you cannot trust countries you
cannot trust companies you cannot trust

86
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,179
politicians

87
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,550
and so my conclusions base you can only
trust

88
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,650
individuals and am you need to

89
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,219
trust Trust you've got some how do you
know someone was calling something you

90
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,340
can decide if you want to trust the
person or not

91
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,820
am it's pretty bad at the moment am

92
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,169
so what do in need to look at to
actually fix the hole so I

93
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:42,820
stop from the bar in start from bottom
bitch basically looking at the GSM

94
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,310
networked which got good known a lot of
floors

95
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,030
then we look at the cell phones they are
two operating systems on a cell phone

96
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,650
basically once the basement operating
system which is handling the GSM

97
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,370
connection

98
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,370
on process or am and then we have a
second operating system which is then

99
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,030
and Android devices the Linux and then
this program running on it which is an

100
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,400
odd

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,429
some and we look at their baseman
security for me we look at the end

102
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:08,970
result

103
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,220
place itself then a huge problem is the
whole permission management is broken

104
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,080
and if people start fixing it am it gets
another iteration like now with Android

105
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,969
5 basically is broken again even worse
so

106
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,630
then we have and data encryption was
introduced

107
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,749
a.m.

108
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:32,219
not too long ago with Android and forget
it

109
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:36,129
it's a uses the encrypt would Ike
consider not too bad

110
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,319
but the implementation breaks it
completely

111
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:42,370
it its use less than trypsin so they
said

112
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,370
good this the goody encrypt doing a good
job

113
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,409
but am it doesn't work

114
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,150
us to secure storage so and then we have
the communication tools itself

115
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,758
from more both for normal number phone
Monique

116
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,979
a.m. communication which cannot be
secured

117
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:04,938
then we can go the route over Voice over
IP a different messages services

118
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:09,339
Peter streaming they are options and I
will try to point them out

119
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:13,039
so then we have search and browsing
their couple of sears is

120
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,389
with that and then the Google Apps
itself

121
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,830
it's like Mike an onset remove them this
no sense to do anything good about it

122
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,400
and except that they are very nice to
use and then finally we have secure wipe

123
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,789
which is Essen essentially because
mobile devices can

124
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:33,930
can get lost easily am okay

125
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,919
Saudi isms broken by design am

126
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,149
first of the obvious thing you have to
identify issue not permitted to really

127
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:44,089
change them when identifying us

128
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,599
am bound to the device and the other one

129
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,789
this to your sim cut am the device
pundits like a makeup dress

130
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:55,550
am of Ethernet card I saw am

131
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,580
you cannot change that one this the SIM
card you can replace

132
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,589
and then you also have identifiers it is
that at an Android device

133
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:07,310
which is exit bound am to the to the um

134
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,219
to the Android version okay but that's
not GSM network so then you can

135
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:13,189
compromise the base base stations

136
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:16,399
mg is embodied Jen naked general problem
that

137
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,449
am the am that nobody feisty to

138
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,699
out indicate self to their base station
but not the other way around

139
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:28,180
there's a slight MZ catch us work that
someone

140
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,560
process a.m. I I'm a base station

141
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,159
all mobile phones who received this is
the strongest signal would stop blocking

142
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,659
in

143
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,360
to that I'm Obama by phone was says I'm
a base base station

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,399
if and that my phone for us the
connections is completely transparent

145
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,350
and M and then you can say okay this
trip to

146
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,890
okay but that first-generation GSM crypt
is completely broken

147
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,339
this not much security in there anymore
and anyway if you can fake a base

148
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,430
station you can say

149
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,569
disable crypto and you will not realize
that the

150
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,260
initial GSM standard said okay this
needs to be at least for rotted

151
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,670
to the use operating systems but was not
implemented

152
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,949
so basically you cannot figure out if
you use encrypt on them or by phone or

153
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,360
not

154
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,579
at least to their the connection which
course the base station in the hood

155
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:21,339
you cannot even figure out if you
actually using infinite skid base

156
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:22,000
station

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,220
so then you have Thailand SMSs it's
possible to send

158
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,230
some and control messages

159
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,290
I'm similar to SMS to a more iPhone

160
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,990
am and they do not keep your eye on the
device you cannot see I received her

161
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,839
Sun SMS Matt it can be used actually to
enforce

162
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,839
I'm location information ends lease s
kinda SMS's can also be used

163
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,760
to run exploits or receive sends the
information from the basement

164
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,279
operating system sends information means
yes a-gps

165
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,100
in the AM you have for you have a camera
in the area for microphone

166
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,410
and that can be am exists once

167
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,199
am on certain versions software exploits
unknown but you may see can run

168
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:11,839
exploits fear son SMS so and then I
mention already we have

169
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,000
in secure channel encryption am
everything basically which is

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,790
be law 3G or maybe including 3G already

171
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,839
am isn't secure you when

172
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,310
there's nothing that can be done it
about it except

173
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,680
a.m. disabling it so I am

174
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,050
then we have to sit hidden operating
systems okay this

175
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,229
this am you cannot have her

176
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,339
own operating system a up

177
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,440
okay this a real time operating system
handling voice calls and the connection

178
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,660
to the GSM network

179
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,910
and you cannot have your own operating
system need to be certified

180
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,410
and am there's not much happening on
base been operating systems basically

181
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:00,509
this the same for Amber which was like
created in 2007 it was sort of works and

182
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:02,019
it's %uh many many devices

183
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:06,799
so on and their couple of just a couple
of questions depending on different

184
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,649
am phone vendors but basically it's most
of the time the same

185
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:14,889
am the same operating system and it's
completely close source you have no idea

186
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:16,410
what's going on that on there

187
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,790
and am box I'm not fixed so once this an
exploit known

188
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,730
to whatever excess specific information
the year for example asylum SMS

189
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,019
am it's not getting fixed if no shucks
perfect that on

190
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:34,269
fix that on the phone am sorry for
remote access to send us and memory

191
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,290
which is serious

192
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,769
am especially memory am and many many am

193
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:44,619
a smart devices you basically have their
have shared memory which is shared

194
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,559
between the base

195
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,230
based on operating system and your Linux
running on it or whatever the use

196
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,470
operating system it

197
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,110
is that that means that from the
baseband processor you can access memory

198
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,419
am which you're using other and running
applications and

199
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,350
so am this the this a serious problem in

200
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,619
am am in a in a cell phone

201
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:10,959
you also have custom for miss so

202
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,660
am if you if you was that most have you
might might

203
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,779
my will usually knocks you have some
some

204
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,779
deal on carts we need to have a custom
firmware

205
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,829
like loaded into actually use that so

206
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,618
my phones are for with that jeff 10-15

207
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:32,399
firm breasts which I'll order to these
devices to make mcmanus non Bluetooth

208
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,929
NFC near-field communication camera
working

209
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,980
so s Westwood will not work and there
are no open source variance

210
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,299
and this from this and not fixed unless
a.m.

211
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:47,259
something breaks and its very difficult
to say

212
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:51,029
am if they contain back doors or not so
most probably

213
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:55,669
they do saw my advice basically would be
the first advice would be

214
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,449
retire 3G dog

215
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,620
use three 2/2g on on your phone use

216
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,160
everything was behind three and a half
the problem is I think the only devices

217
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,290
I ever saw which got it disable 3G
button once a blackberry and was only

218
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,510
and certain versions so am

219
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,710
and most from Bristol not even for rent
information to give away the information

220
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,730
am and wear them term so

221
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,980
am the idea would be basically if you
earn it in see heavy in secure

222
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,800
connection

223
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,599
or you use it to G network to basically
go into flight mode or disable the phone

224
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,190
am that's possible but it's not
implemented yet then skip non-free for

225
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,770
me is

226
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,470
also very very very difficult because
like on certain services like wireless

227
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,600
lan: you need to

228
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,000
min skip get that the promised land
islam is in some cases more safe than

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,490
using using GSM

230
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,240
which creates another problem am so
basically

231
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,860
you would need a separate device to make
a connection to the GSM network

232
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,200
am some and then what do we have

233
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,820
okay you can stop monitoring basement
activity that's pretty in dissent

234
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,700
interesting this

235
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,500
endroit MZ am catcher detector

236
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,350
which is pretty fresh out there it's an
open source project

237
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,590
which try to aim to detect MC Catra
activity

238
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,730
am so that means like fake base station
activity

239
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,930
am on your phone so you can keep this
running and try to see

240
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,910
if this a fake beat me station out there
which is for demonstration may be good

241
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,420
idea

242
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,110
when you know when you should try to
switch off your phone or and all

243
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,910
you can also try to figure out a silent
messages but only a small subset of this

244
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,199
man's messages are

245
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,970
detected at the moment so am and/or MZ
catcher

246
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,700
detective project I can really recommend
%um to look at it

247
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,290
am so what else am

248
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,810
harding Android okay that's that's a
that the

249
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,020
it's a tough thing am and it basically
it's not possible

250
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,150
bunt am what most people connect to do

251
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,930
thick two's to set some settings for
example like

252
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,910
disabling

253
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,170
in am am location information that's
possible still on all versions and I can

254
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,290
really recommend this

255
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:19,040
unless you actually needed and then
disable texts and voice input

256
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,199
it basically you type in your password

257
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,590
and at the same time you uploading with
a damn with a.m.

258
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:31,600
with it a.m. text detection mission is
me upload basically all the time you're

259
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,440
everything a typing up a keylogger in
the air am because that would

260
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,450
to the suggestions s not the tree on on
that on that

261
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,240
and on the telephone you better be
uploaded to Google all the time what

262
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,190
you're typing in

263
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,200
so every pass what you type into Google

264
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,740
devise and tender to revise this
high-risk you actually uploaded

265
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,810
am your password somewhere am

266
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,800
head even gets worse for for example
while Islam passwords

267
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,260
8 Google backs up see a system saw

268
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,290
that means they have every SSID

269
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,000
in which you ever locked in hey and they
also

270
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,870
on your device this the password for the
Vita Vita salon

271
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,100
stored in plain text me in Quebec's
update to its nice

272
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,270
so basically they have or later ID's you
ever been to

273
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,890
and the same time have or passwords you
locked in and that's all in plain text

274
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,360
saw not a good idea to disable back pick
up and restore case self

275
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,400
for backup and restore and then there's
something

276
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,290
very nice because it's very very easy am

277
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,730
Android devices are partially identified

278
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,150
by unique identify on device name

279
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,500
which is like in Dryden and some wrong
number Haiti

280
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,480
you can change that name why not calling
that local host

281
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,490
so how many devices are there which our
local host

282
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,650
so that's great so change that below
class really easy

283
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,560
you make it a bit more difficult so

284
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,219
Android permission management are that's
really really bad

285
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,230
so ok everyone knows like basically
installer in replication

286
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,800
and then it's really unclear until you
should receive that long list what kind

287
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,129
of commissions are needed

288
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,200
so and then the requests are getting
really excessive

289
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,760
basically you can decide to and wants to
install

290
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,220
Angry Birds or whatever and and if

291
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,470
all my permission to where he or not

292
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:31,070
am descriptions are completely unclear

293
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,549
in my opinion and am

294
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:37,780
Google never really thought about it
like revoking

295
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,720
so if I install something with a no no
no wait wait wait wait that program

296
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,660
doesn't need access to my address book I
would like to disable that

297
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,240
no I they can even more defiant so
that's no

298
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,080
thats unreasonable but it cannot get
began not be fixed with the custom

299
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,590
Android build am so

300
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,740
and even gets worse so am for

301
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,540
limited time am Android black Google
head and the end right to ask sauce

302
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,168
court

303
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:09,320
am at coat which showed okay there's
some

304
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,409
développement to revoke permissions

305
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,400
really really nice and once like some
guys once you on again much

306
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,290
estimated this and there was some out
there called apps

307
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,600
to get excess to that privacy got

308
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,760
them am and snippets google said he'd

309
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,470
we takeaways funding from you see on a
gets guys

310
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,410
unless you remove that again but the
court was in there and what happened

311
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,260
hey it's not in the cold anymore so the
sources

312
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,740
do not include the privacy got anymore
and pretty much the same time

313
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,530
that was like some this bring sum WEA am

314
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,010
on google also update the Play Store the
place to the book contains the library

315
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,840
and that lively basically able to change
any permission

316
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,020
without any notification saw

317
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,510
am so basically you lost control
completely once you have pretty

318
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,220
recent version of Play Store on your
device because

319
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,860
Google can decide which commissions a
given and

320
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,928
change that later without notifying you
sake that's cool but what about

321
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:23,220
am the the developer who was requesting

322
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,730
permissions now there are a couple of
classes switch

323
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,970
contain

324
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,020
lot of fine grain specific commissions

325
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,150
witchy get shown am am

326
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,890
when you install you enjoy that the
thing is

327
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,140
am the first thing is that

328
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,280
with in that group de Villota love us I

329
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,420
able to extent their rights

330
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,429
within an update without

331
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:54,470
in without you getting naughty fight saw
am you install

332
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,940
your Android at which got a the right to

333
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,710
reach your contacts and only that you
install they try to regroup and okay

334
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,890
that's related I would like to send a
message

335
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,280
I would like that my contacts are shown
but then the next

336
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,580
update which is good installed
automatically gives also permission to

337
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,639
modify and delete

338
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,320
and you were not figure that out NHA

339
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,049
it's just getting changed and that's the
developer whose

340
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:25,120
Chris changing that not not not Google
contained in anything

341
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,479
the good people over got the sort of
limited likes of caged

342
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,970
but its am its its massive

343
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,030
if a.m. the the obligations because
basically

344
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,090
request tiny permission every group

345
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,899
but which means they can do it anything
with the next update

346
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,919
because changes within that group are

347
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,450
free that can be done so and then
there's not a very funny thing since

348
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,820
Android for

349
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,700
got 8 19 there is no option anymore to
revoke permission for network access

350
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,309
paid never missus is granted to
medically for all applications you

351
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,370
installing a device

352
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:07,059
which is sort of dodgy depends on your
Android version

353
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:11,120
the EF at up some application which can

354
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,010
between for dot 3 for I think so

355
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,150
active I'd a.m. the the privacy got more
tools

356
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,770
and some see on a kitten versions you
have privacy got to

357
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,440
which are not maintained anymore but
that's all between

358
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm version for 434 I think so on for
eight nineteen

359
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,450
which I can sort of reccommend if you
would like to have the easy part try to

360
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,020
get a soon not soon forget

361
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,620
min

362
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,689
much version where the private economy
is activated

363
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,440
and then you have to express the model
which is part of them

364
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,330
am offer offer framework you can also
consider to look into that but it's

365
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,250
pretty complex

366
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,580
self hottest team in Firelands

367
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,370
file encryption so am okay I mentioned
SD

368
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:04,639
okay am you have to devise to operating
system says the Linux running and her

369
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,700
Java program which is Android and you
nominee

370
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,370
can only stay in that Java program so am

371
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,149
the encryption when you enable
encryption on your energy visor

372
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,080
only encrypts one folder which is the
doctor folder

373
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,360
which should contain M most of the pipe
information

374
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,860
but not the SD card not the whole device
its that one

375
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,689
data folder so the device will tonya
okie you need to activate a PIN or

376
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,300
password 2 a.m.

377
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,300
actually to am to get access to that
storage

378
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,980
which which most people might use a pin
so you have a demand DM crips

379
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,020
with their for who

380
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,270
with ur within with up in protecting

381
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,350
the the secret key hits four numbers

382
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,750
so that's not secure all you can break
that in

383
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,510
no time saw that penis asked every time

384
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,260
when you unlock your phone when you look
you need to put in the pin again the

385
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,990
Kentucky it take a password

386
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,990
I am but the thing is you need to type
that in

387
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,840
every time you unlock your phone know
most people with subtlety thats take a

388
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,570
small shop password

389
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,899
pay everything that's beyond like

390
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,040
around six characters or less a maybe
7-8

391
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,800
can also be broken or time in it
something long random you cannot

392
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,919
remember that anymore

393
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,170
you need to put every time you unlock
your phone its unusable

394
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,630
so the thing the the trick is if you
manually change

395
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,460
the DMV problem the encrypt password
having

396
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,390
a root shell on your energy vice you can
change that

397
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,040
the European still works but

398
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,560
it

399
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,090
to leave the diem crib petition is am

400
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,280
is with the long password which you need
two into one time

401
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,420
when your booty vice but that was
disabled to

402
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,620
you can't do it manually but you need to
shell fix that

403
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,429
and then you have a secure password at
least for that one petition soap

404
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,640
said place you important information in
there saw

405
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,940
am forget tedious and you cannot fix it

406
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,190
I would 10 to take the route Voice over
IP

407
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,460
the thing as most my server IP providers
not basically

408
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,760
all of them don't offer secure
connections so you need to have a pen

409
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,370
shake

410
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,120
and you have a streaming protocol which
in insurance like that the stream is

411
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,840
secured

412
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,600
pay and basically no provider offers
connection to other networks

413
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,280
if it's encrypt it the only solutions I
source like

414
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,330
Cisco VPN solutions then you have basic
PC Connection and two

415
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,230
your your radio voice over IP provided
that convicted do it

416
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,330
a have access again to the doctor so am

417
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,840
they are really not trustworthy service
provider out there that's my guess

418
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,240
and am so there's something called the
OC in protic open source telephony

419
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,410
network

420
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,370
I did you recommend you to look into
that you can set up your own

421
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:08,149
am Voice over IP books them at home or
connect to the more open network

422
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,220
am who works nicely some

423
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,290
now videotape still worked on

424
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,580
Austin but it's a question of time I
guess will happen this

425
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,840
this year beginning next year so

426
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,449
but you cannot connect to other networks
it's a serious problem

427
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,910
saw what we have tell them we have a.m.

428
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,980
personal information management to the
Pima applications like address book

429
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,320
like a lender on our device we have
opera see where for male with messaging

430
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,210
am it it's all not secure with Google
services

431
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,590
so basically if you would have have
something like it's incrimination with

432
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,540
your address book

433
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,930
i think is II 3u takes pity like a.m.

434
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,710
company was offering a surface like this
or you can try own clout

435
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,640
build your own clout am

436
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,540
works nicely this application called def
Droitwich doing the synchronization

437
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,740
between your calendar

438
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,890
and your own cloud server works nicely I
my wife is using that works

439
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,200
saw the same with a GPG and

440
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,180
PDP and am so you can use that with
email

441
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,570
this k-9 mail with a ADP extension

442
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,629
Android privacy got and

443
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,120
um works nicely so otro

444
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,750
IIIi suggests used to it secure

445
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,470
I think you all know the Guardian
project them concerning mobile

446
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,450
applications

447
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,490
so if you don't you should look that up

448
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,790
if you at this if you use Android on

449
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:43,790
and video this this them something
called a bit RTC which is a p2p approach

450
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:48,090
which you might enable video sessions
and then Tiffany as well

451
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,659
am with the p2p ok approach I guess that
will be interesting

452
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,660
on on on mobile devices in general some

453
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,750
on what else we have secure search
Google search is broken

454
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,060
am do not use that am

455
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,120
terms perhaps to a horrible am

456
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,679
tore I come back to Taurus well I really
recommend using to our

457
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,190
but don't use any I'm secure traffic
over tour

458
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,560
the exit nodes are run by the bad guys

459
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,060
so if you have anything plane takes
running over it or network

460
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,190
you can gets guaranteed analyzed

461
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,260
saw M make sure that you applications do
not leak

462
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,320
any personal doctor so you cannot take
his a a Firefox

463
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,780
great and run the traffic through to our
vets dangerous

464
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,559
okay

465
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,480
so am I think your best bet is a moment
Duck Duck Go

466
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,210
might be a failure as well but the nice
thing about tactical

467
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,390
actually they have a hidden service say
this a.m.

468
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,790
you can access doctor Korver hit in
service page

469
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,050
it's not really an ounce very publicly
but it's there

470
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,210
and that you run by doctor ko itself and
you can see that with %uh

471
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,630
certificates so on this doctor course
ocean stories which

472
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,170
works very similar to Google search I'm
I recommend you to look into that

473
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,800
so I am what else am if you

474
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,270
this already which is a sort of

475
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,379
my bet browser which leaks a very few
information

476
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,270
am the thing is most people are not
prepared to use that

477
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:31,660
so they insist on Firefox so what can
you do with Firefox increase privacy

478
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,130
and maintain usability am

479
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,340
you can have a couple of it owns I
recommend HCP everywhere it's from a

480
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,490
creek frontage foundations they do a
couple of nice things

481
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:47,490
and also the privacy Becher so had he
was anywhere mitt will try to the

482
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,580
setup SSR connection whenever possible

483
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,230
and they make sure that actually the one
you're connected to the right SSL

484
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,900
certificate

485
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,270
that's really really nice then I'm you
have phony

486
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:04,240
waken fake your identity is an OK from
Android but I would like to be an iPhone

487
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,870
and paid then you an iPhone you
basically scan Web pages

488
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,370
where the other one thanks to an iPhone
or an iPad or whatever

489
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,610
am privacy better is there a.m.

490
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,629
i FF version of them often at broker
very very nice pretty fresh out there

491
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,660
many of clean create okay that's a.m.
basically

492
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,910
a.m. for cleaning when you were when you
close the browser

493
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,720
self-destructing could be some very nice
so it gives you a cookie a lifetime of

494
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,960
10 seconds that's much nicer so one
should close your web site

495
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,970
10 seconds cookies get deleted

496
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,090
really nice you can use the side once
you've finished

497
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,830
you're finished and then obviously this
is no script version which I can very

498
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,280
much

499
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,980
re comment am when you install boat
which is there

500
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,740
to our implementation

501
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,710
for enright am this basically the option
to either choose applications which

502
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,620
should run

503
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,800
through to our and the other snot am

504
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,860
an or you set it up as a proxy which you
can manually configure or

505
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,169
us transparent proxy which ex you routes
all traffic through the a

506
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,590
but you don't know if it's really
secured last two minutes thanks

507
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,110
am so this all wall that's pretty

508
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,129
pretty you that's a IP tables management
wakened by default

509
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,890
ban all applications from network access
even more recent Android version

510
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,840
so by default no one can access the
network many can decide per application

511
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,550
hokey these are your from am

512
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,350
requirements am you get excess view tour

513
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,020
you get direct access or you get special
permission because you in a voice over

514
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,129
IP application

515
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,450
really really nice basically is an IP
management

516
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,670
am VRM be a proper interface

517
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,850
it's really nice look at it or more
project

518
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,629
so I am fixing the holes

519
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,830
okay am I would just rushed through and

520
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:06,309
basically I made a small table on what
how you can match certain applications

521
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:08,010
to open source applications

522
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,550
the Play Store can be replaced with F
dried very nice to have only open source

523
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,600
software on their

524
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,730
then the underachiever its we removed I
can

525
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,540
recommend the heck you're on the niece
of people art Google Maps is always an

526
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,178
armed

527
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,670
and okay I will read that not all this
website

528
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:29,360
II can announce that again am where
basically linked all that applications

529
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,610
with a short summaries

530
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,639
so um I will close it now

531
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,070
head so my recommendations are install
see on again much orbit are replete

532
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,590
country become project really nice

533
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,800
but they only support a handful devices
but if you have the oldest 20 is three

534
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,290
they have

535
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,980
pretty good isolation of the basement
operating system am

536
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,630
with the with the with you use operating
system you can play around with it it's

537
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,600
really nice

538
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,090
and look at voter into a truck on these
are not

539
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,439
the old dry cum informations much much
more

540
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,600
and I were I hope sometime this year

541
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,669
I will move it to a proper own website
but currently it's just like a fuller

542
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,320
somewhere

543
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,320
so replace collapse not this

544
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,379
nor shuns you can use keep using Google
apes

545
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,900
if you care about privacy this no way to
fix that

546
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,930
am using crypts in by default

547
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,910
even if you know that system is baggy
you can be targeted

548
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,890
and and and exploited but you do
something

549
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,390
like M used try any contribution for
secure

550
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,810
communication and to limit am UAL a.m.

551
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:41,510
you you are sort of protecting you and
others against some violence not against

552
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,580
targeted attacks

553
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,280
so am Tamim

554
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,810
am if you think they are holes in their
give me feedback

555

561
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:19,120
okay 30 okay

562
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:27,300
can you wait for the microphone

563
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:31,980
okay

564
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,060
I'm using expressing my mobile phone
yeah and

565
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,720
has who were you told that explain what
is complicated in

566
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,020
I don't see you are recommending to use
X privacy way or not

567
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,730
recommending the ex privacy because I
only recommend

568
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,080
things my my waifu study to

569
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,320
literacy and my son was 10 years old I
able

570
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,970
to use on the spot so I am X privacy is

571
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,520
very comprehensive if you can re
configure

572
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,000
lot with it most people will not be able
really to deal with it

573
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,060
unless you work through it take you to a
friends look the Essex privacy

574
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:12,100
I think it works on Android 5 a salami
with and this is your only option anyway

575
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,199
am but a its its

576
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:22,199
nothing for the faint of heart that's a
problem

577
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:33,639
yeah your

578
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,920
yeah let's talk later about that okay

579
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,520
I have a question actually

580
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,909
come into question for some well what do
you think about the

581
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,509
a block from or airports like that the
platform

582
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,160
which perform black foam are the black
phone

583
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,069
yeah I wonder what that the one made by
silent circle the WAP

584
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,680
the one made by silence article yeah
opted because they are

585
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,850
doing some of the

586
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:10,900
of use you're saying that Android should
have by default so

587
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,720
included way P services included into
and

588
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,080
by their claim love Dave modified
operating system

589
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,250
and maids their own version of Android
and removed some of the capabilities and

590
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,550
stuff like that

591
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,740
to prevent I was really X and from what
the

592
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,379
arm mister zimmermann sad at that gone

593
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,510
and other conferences they are also
working we've been video up to

594
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,960
actually or did the baseband firmware in
that is used

595
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,650
in the particular their particular phone
bright yeah am

596
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:48,460
okay am the black phone okie am silent
circle then Switzerland now

597
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,790
liked to minus the event of dem of pgp

598
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,470
and dick phone that suspends Spanish
company they actually they built the

599
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,100
house where

600
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,569
am I A the the thing is

601
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,440
I looking for a solution which I can
recommend to friends

602
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,990
which already half Android phone

603
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:13,589
saw the black phone costs 600-800 your
maybe like in like an iPhone in that

604
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,690
that range and you have subscriptions in
need to pay which

605
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,810
are not she that included in the boy

606
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:25,549
here for two years so then you can
actually by ear

607
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,200
cost this description that I like the
idea really I i

608
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,779
that was one of my triggers to look more
into it now

609
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,630
am I like the black phone am I don't
know how the

610
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:41,010
basement is relations are like the low
level stuff I i'm not really sure

611
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,450
but privacy laws is not open yet so
nobody can recheck what they're doing

612
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,868
sects in a month is sure one of the guys
I would seem keen

613
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:51,930
I can shot of trust him even if I don't
know him because

614
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,060
did some cool stuff and okay they might
have a reason to go to Switzerland so

615
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,770
maybe they

616
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,369
think about problems with the
authorities so I am

617
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:04,390
but it's a device he too byee and it
only works with the other people also

618
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,460
having one that's not for families

619
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,500
for that that's the that's a problem
right but but when you say that

620
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,869
and read is like very bad for private in
his new album

621
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:18,010
yeah what do you compare it to because
if you compare it why or a

622
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,350
I O S from some perspective Lois's be
maybe

623
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:25,560
more secure love not more private

624
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,680
more secure but it's more also more
closed in and

625
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,359
with and learn you we should really
compare and retain operating system

626
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,339
like a laptop or desktop operating
system because that what it is

627
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,470
its it so portable computer in your
phone

628
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,910
not also has the GSM network so it's no
longer a phone

629
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,279
it securely a computing device in people
that use it

630
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,079
make the personal choice to help a
portable computer in the

631
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,220
in the pocket right so I

632
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:59,230
removal is it really is it's really less
secure than Windows

633
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,400
is it's realistic you're done the Knicks
the Dix Hills Drive worth living cells

634
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,619
don't want to drive worth

635
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,059
has grown North drivers yeah I just
compare both know is and

636
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:12,260
there's bias the other stop overall
weakness is you have with the Linux you

637
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,859
also will have on the Android because
this I'm a linux

638
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,500
run on their am the problem with I'm
mainly have

639
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,880
with with Google and the taps that they
have full control about everything

640
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,829
and they take away the right to revoke
this information so I think it's pretty

641
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:27,670
troublesome

642
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:32,900
just one more question cuz we r

643
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,030
time one into askins

644
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,970
also to my friend I I'll what do you
think about all right forms last single

645
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,490
open source is development by Moxie a
rat phone

646
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,868
homeless assisted on Android yeah ya top
why

647
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,720
okee the thing us within

648
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,270
red phone and text secure specially
whole discussion with texts if you

649
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,740
secure and ok or sores and custom bills
and F droid

650
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,629
there's a lot of was a lot of tension
there I

651
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,609
team isometric said this a lot about
trust and

652
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:12,450
am the I have problem to trusts whisper
systems

653
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,450
specially since then we have bought from
Twitter on a schism

654
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:20,439
are you plan that you trust lass a guy
like moxie

655
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:26,290
that denied I like feeling Zimmerman I
just more moxie

656
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,150
i'd I don't want to put Moxham Island by

657
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,290
the table definitely not now it

658
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,600
I like that guy I disagree on certain
things with them and I have a problem

659
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,040
with that great of power that Google
halves on these two applications

660
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,970
which i think is a large sum yup

661
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:51,970
yep

662
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:59,890
okay yep I cannot thank you with it

663
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,520
it's like I have a bad feeling about
that

664
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,410
and that's why I'm I'm I'm I'm staying
away from it

665
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,759
its it's not I cannot reason it okay so

really but I wanted to ask you some
something actually more technical at the
