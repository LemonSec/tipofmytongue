sorry for my bad english so

17
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:09,080
so with lots of journalists a

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,420
lot of people who are thinking about
what journalist

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,100
up doing but even if you are

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,339
in a safe and democratic own country you
can have

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,580
problems and people can take you know
that that's even

22
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,420
if you are email is safe n democratic
and country you can be spied by

23
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,890
NASA all what its so hard to protect
yourself

24
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,509
just knowing you're tours a

25
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:41,020
against to write to don't have you that
does with you

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:47,869
that's important to protect sources and
after that beginning

27
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:51,030
who really big nightmare to a ing

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,810
to be better and better and better with
security

29
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,119
in France a do look pretty girl

30
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,159
and cool country

31
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,759
you there is a new new low it was a
project when they could just slide

32
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,050
the to reload now a me

33
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,569
they would eat a few days ago now

34
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,768
intelligence can monitor everybody

35
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,410
communications without judge permission

36
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,760
that means

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,959
when you add to list they come no who
are your sources

38
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,690
who are you going to you hook who'll you
are calling

39
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,140
sorry who you are writing to and maybe
open using

40
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,929
you remains if you don't think a move to
communications

41
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,880
they say okay maybe

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,690
maybe that's because of terrorism all
his for terrorism

43
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,920
they try to to spy you every time that's
because of terrorism

44
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,839
but in france in 86 we heard an attempt

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,230
it fayed but it was in

46
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,410
18 86 internet doesn't exist

47
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,359
so this terrorism stories at just

48
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:11,109
witty if you don't know how you computer
rocks

49
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:15,769
hull how you can be sure you protect
your data

50
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:19,269
if you just

51
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,090
up in something a to a two-run program

52
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,850
and you don't know what this problem is
doing how you can know

53
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,549
Eve this program don't take your that
does don't

54
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:34,120
a don't open your five doled

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,470
send you five to

56
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,859
someone there's a distance lol something
like that and if you don't use free

57
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:43,500
software

58
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,730
how you can know watch a computer is
doing

59
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,950
yeah maybe you you can know because you
are technical

60
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,410
high-level but no more people come no

61
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,380
whether the computer are doing the first
step

62
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:07,380
ease to use free software

63
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,099
second

64
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,399
civil way the lady is

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,480
hosting a sting is

66
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,070
losing your data when you're so nice

67
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,079
okay that's good but they don't know how
to

68
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,940
run a server on something like that so
first you learn how to use go online

69
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,330
we this time so okay you have to learn
about security on your server

70
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,289
having a is this SK and stuff like that

71
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,940
bookie but where I can put the server

72
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,290
they had to you 28 is first in a data
center

73
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,780
civilian enough friends home

74
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:53,549
with his home computer depends on what
you

75
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,210
do you want to do is friends that's good
because you can learn a lot of things

76
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,479
because so one's here when you have a
question

77
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,539
Burnham something like that but

78
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,539
even is a really good friends

79
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:10,539
you don't know if she comes excesses
that us

80
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:13,550
so that's again

81
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,710
problem I love my friends but they have
to protect my sources

82
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,229
and that is most important so you can

83
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,530
who died in a data center and maybe
asking friends to help you to

84
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,530
reeled the security abusive that is a
first step

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,419
so first you don't come online second
your own server

86
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:43,030
after it's time to play when I was in a
deep

87
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,239
the during during and after I'm about to
leave their

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,729
I really love to use F think

89
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,620
good month nothing is really good
because you don't love you

90
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,479
your stuff is your in your computer you
as the girl you just

91
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:03,300
send everything to

92
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,680
see other does ever can be everywhere in
the world

93
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,870
and you have nothing with you so it was
really really good day love

94
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,119
housing was my favorite command but

95
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:18,699
was again aboard every time you fix a
security problem

96
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:24,429
a new problem the PO because

97
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:28,029
or is recalled in but his story

98
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,379
so what is

99
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:37,589

101
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:42,669
for you to believe you been

102
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,169

prolly for the mic with exceed 80

104
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:53,789
but this week those thought apology
sequin

105
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,498
you don't understand that no mothers
infants but

106
00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:00,969
the problem is I am friends and they
don't understand at all

107
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:05,069
so when you are Germany's knowing

108
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:09,050
nothing about computer yet thank you

France we have some hikers space

112
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,639
so you can go on ask question to people
so

113
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,849
another thing you have to learn what is
bush what these measures story

114
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,889
in how to manage with that

115
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,909
you know the a but she story

116
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,740
don't recall you think a month because
its authority

117
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,139

118
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,779

to a silver

119
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:51,379
to send you that does you have the
problem because they can connect to the

120
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:51,949
server

121
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:57,219
and find it at that so so you have to
ask to your computer

122
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:00,248
okay dolt recalled 1i sent

123
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:04,360

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,469
but what about my flesh keys MySQL

125
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:12,498

126
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:16,779
there's just sheets because you

127
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,849
all know a everybody can

128
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:26,300
find that as you did it from you is to

129
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,780
with Wii really useful tool so

130
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,039
everybody can fide so you have to cover

131
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,539
and cover uncover and cover your

132
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,740
your jobs are you flush keys or maybe
make a shred

133
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,040
with is the reserve list he's so yet

134
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,770
a new command to know ok it's another

135
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,430
go to say okay that's a good sayings a
sensor data

136
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,959
they don't see the I

137
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,600
cover every to axe so I'm lookin I can
go to the wall

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,790
and having no problem was intelligence

139
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,839
okay but if you open you fides

140
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,810
the again it may if you open your fights
before to send

141
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,839
to your 80 20 arm

142
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,570
someone is a newspaper you work for as a
parent is

143
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,340
when you open the file in the memory of
your computer

144
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,920
you that does in the minute as

145
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,709
can be stocked so that's begin a problem
if you clean

146
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,340
all really good if you send all your
cell

147
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,520
and he was a fun with that doesn't that
doesn't your computer

148
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,920
it's again a problem so you

149
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,719
to learn heart to how to

150
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,080
did these tracks the other problem

151
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,050
ease USB a flashed his because when you
going

152
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,589
Breast Center a everywhere when you have

153
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,020
country runs a those places for
journalists

154
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,480
and they put on lots of lots of cash
keys we speak to you

155
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,860
rules and information earns and you see
%uh joins the

156
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,860
good news and they put on the computer

157
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,350
just take the pic to exam permission to
20 years as good

158
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,780
I have everything to write not secured
and that's good

159
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,819
day is as good you have everything and a
man were

160
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,870
knows the solution ease

161
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,670
to never blog a flash your computer

162
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,140
first without knowing and I am

163
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,730
I trying to I'll to check email my
resume RBI

164
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,060
Raspberry Pi a I don't know

165
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,319
if you lose a best way I'm doing that
like you're like a brother one in my own

166
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,770
a me I'm using raspy

167
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:01,230
rest but Raspberry Pi sorry to move
create an easy though

168
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,010
and verify if is a price flash key is

169
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,520
a there is no a hidden

170
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,160
a dot eggs if I'd because sometimes you
can open a PDF

171
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,170
open a GPG fight in that a

172
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,360
that the name the file any run a mile
away you can't

173
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,300
a you can't open exit side wheeze a

174
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,319
reserve free software reserve hoping to
so is as good if you don't use window

175
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,010
that's a good thing this is it's

176
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,210
not every time every time every time

177
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,030
every time you learn on a new security
solution

178
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,740
every time you discover new problems
reading

179
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,430
so that's good to connect to a server to
put you don't own it

180
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,859
but if you just gonna make we got

181
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,890
business it's security they can

182
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,020
find a terrific and I hope so they can
monitor

183
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,120
0 and the kids find your data and your
sources and I was sick

184
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,890
so filth connect with this is it's

185
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,910
on UAL sever

186
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,089
but didn't rip did for does an improved
its orders in a group that for girls

187
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,790
where they lived in there every grow in
my computer on my server

188
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,110
I every time the puts

189
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,900
the aerobic the inserts

190
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,650
fall a bus routes was a bit upset
engineering

191
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,360
a imogene eaves a find me and the beats
me a lot

192
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,500
a after I well then I will know in
detail why

193
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,600
i would tell my purse world and there
with days ago

194
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,650
okay your mother is a cow and he was
just nothing that my bus world

195
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,480
that's the let the CD way but that's a
good way to protect

196
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,720
sometimes your folder another thing
stuff

197
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,080
you don't know secretary Len and ticking
for the permissions

198
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,220
because you can rights when you want to
sell you know that's

199
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,950
what's when you'll join his you don't

200
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,440
you don't check the sort of stinks and
sometimes

201
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,870
if someone else access to your cell and
can

202
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,430
modify your documents yen

203
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,859
a overseeing all you can

204
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,090
lose everything because you don't have
anything on your computer

205
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,310
home om these issue disputes everything

206
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,290
on the server begin for to check the
mission and

207
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,839
the question is who can access to the
server that's another question about

208
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,490
Asian

209
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,730
but

210
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,660
but but but if you don't want to do all
of that

211
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,850
things can be easy

212
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:05,850
she States it's time you through you
need to transfer data

213
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,370
you can use

214
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,010
I'll think my favorite command you can
connect

215
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:18,540
through 20 you can

216
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,870
have no information in the rd's

217
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,080
so that's

218
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,820
a good solution if you don't want to

219
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,440
a mmm to a mmm

220
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,420
to welcome a lot I know the difficult
and I'm learning

221
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,819
already I'm already learning

222
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,220
and they will learn in two years and
three years in five years

223
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,870
a to be more and more below but

224
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,830
only understand when you are young to
let is to just go outside of school

225
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,380
you want to go to the world in order to
make big stories

226
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,010
and a you don't want to

227
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,620
to do I love that you can just please
you stay

228
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,400
because yeah maybe you can be alive
because of that

229
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,750
so that's a good idea is one other night

230
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,790
you can sing too mobile phone more but
for because

231
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,030
you know a now because I've snowed in
fines

232
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,329
we know because I was up there with do
you look at his Asian

233
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:31,190
there is with baseband the

234
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,540
some intelligence can year what you're
doing

235
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,170
colicin so year that's applauded when
you go to interview

236
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,819
to meet some activities to meet some
political

237
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,380
a important people and there is just one
solution

238
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:54,380
it was at the microphone that's better
if you have an iPhone you can't do that

239
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:11,080
and the conformal everywhere every time
if you have another phone

240
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,590
you can be free beat but to get you good
to meet

241
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:21,270
can do that too a.m. again monday was
teaching

242
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,930
Louis teaching your some security for
journalists and again Tony

243
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,229
0 have to take my password for Gmail

244
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,450
every time on my computer my telephone

245
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,460
yes because if someone take your
telephone and can

246
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,740
access to your emails professional
inmates

247
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,140
can access to your sources can exist to
you work

248
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,210
so maybe maybe your sources can be in
danger

249
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,060
yeah bed typing my password every time
is bothering me

250
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,979
yeah but you can change your job if you
want

251
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,470
that security

252
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,360
he is not so hard when you understand

253
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,770
just litem sings of every day

254
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,680
if you just tried to type every time
your bus routes

255
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,050
could be better

256
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,589
if the one take your computer

257
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,720
or your terrified Eve

258
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,140
you try to use names to

259
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,500
to protect someone that does it would be
better to use nothing

260
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,790
in you will begin step by step and
step-by-step

261
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,250
and maybe better after enough to inlets
there is

262
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,440
some other questions I'm rocking on it
now

263
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,310
a using private chiapas for as is lame

264
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,659
using to use looks to

265
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,960
to to stall some documents but is it
good to start private keys

266
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,960
I him is it better to moan to flash key
on the live distro

267
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,110
all on the Raspberry Pi and

268
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,399
yet that's more and more complex

269
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,930
every day you should try to lay down a

270
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,600
that's complex but but

271
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,860
protecting sources is not a

272
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,379
in france you have lot of janet was a
okay we

273
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,370
use sings when they will create

274
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,489
useful tools okay

275
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,200
but you have to put the justices and no
one that so

276
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,240
so some tubes exist throws

277
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,650
mature put two fingers owes outside of
your us

278
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,560
without a keyboard and try to ram try to
protect your sources

279
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,820
and if you have a problem some people
can help you to fix it

280
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,280
but things exist and

281
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,740
but they still sees is not someone
that's a responsibility

282
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,900
israel's thank you

283
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Leadership Summit mission they

284
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,330
on to questions first one is how long
did it take you to lying

285
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,350
I'm I don't know much about your
background so I'm curious how long did

286
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,290
it take you to get to

287
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,760
this level of proficiency you know you
pop Michael

288
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,540
quite the Savvis is that mean not like a
your average journalist

289
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:36,030
and and the second question is I will
learn new things everyday and we

290
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,600
we understand that we did something
wrong usually and

291
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,090
until we learn to do it better secure
hospital and I'm curious

292
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,199
when was the last time I mean what was
the last thing

293
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,320
that you learned your doing wrong and
when

294
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,480
was that exactly because you know I just
learned

295
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,030
that having an iPhone is bad and I
learned this today so I'll probably

296
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,920
switch to

297
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,020
a author Jim phone okay so

298
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,510
for the background I leave a I leaves
one year nineteen agents

299
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,600
the between 2009

300
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,240
and mean 2011 a leave desserts

301
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,280
EN a in Tunisia

302
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,770
I was in Sudan I went to say at the
beginning of the revolution

303
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,980
and saw and heard some problems

304
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,340
in my bag time in a jeep people
following you people know you are

305
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,139
giuliani's

306
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,650
the

307
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:35,160
he had policemen around me was a okay if
you steal ur making interviews and stuff

308
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,860
like that

309
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,379
we can arrest you so I was mobilized to
learn

310
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,920
this stuff so the

311
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,180
at the beginning I just had friend got
good

312
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,640
and try to find some things and after I
met some people

313
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,630
blow girls a Blugirl activist in Egypt

from the technical team so

328
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,890

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:37,190
user-friendly solutions right i mean you
could have included some

357
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,760
actual examples of tools that are out
there and

358
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,570
journalist can use use or maybe storage
secure storage sources

359
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,129
store with operating systems like tails

360
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,720
maybe password managers with two-factor
authentication that about 20 knowledge

361
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,380
model

362
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,670

mermaid duckworth after that

366
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,100
when you try to go a when you try to go

367
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,939
after using after using SysTools is from
the tubes

368
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,550
what you can do what you can do to be a
mall secure

369
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,210
a but it is good you know maybe

370
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,430
reporter with the border else they give
days

371
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,090
skis to two people are they held them to
install the PM

372
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,709
ideal told about the VM like

373
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,570
a like you

374
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,639
the actual books and stuff like that but
is good too because

375
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:42,658
the big problem when you have some
julie's ease

376
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,179
they are afraid to change their habits
like

377
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:49,299
like every well because oh I don't know

378
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:53,079
with that and I don't know how how it's
working so yeah I'm afraid and I was

379
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,109
like that is beginning

380
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:57,448
and I you tried 12 in the

381
00:24:57,449 --> 00:25:01,779
the actual machine during months and
when I was ready

382
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,269
i James I tried saw

383
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:08,639
on the mutual machine at the beginning
but they because he was afraid

384
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:12,609
a about words this program I didn't know

385
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:16,228
a ok im doing my computer in

386
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:20,069
the main problem is people who are
afraid but

387
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:23,799
when you make the friendly to run

388
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,440
as so when you you tops the

389
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,729
you can help them with that and helps
them to

390
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:36,679
photo n have the neck that their
questions

391
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:42,909
how your securing your in government

392
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:47,729
mine you're in the moment

393
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:53,019
security what you internet yes how US
securing you're in the moment

394
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,779
okay I depends over depends on what

395
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:00,889
applications connection since using VPN

396
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:04,468
yes a use them sometimes the AM

397
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:08,899
using days the depends on the moment the
Bengals the country because

398
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:12,978
in some countries a yes I include my you
made in France

399
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:16,379
and that's good because lots of not lots
but be tough people

400
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:19,988
improved this that you mates if you're
in a good three

401
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:23,499
where no one encrypt emails and you are

402
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,319
alarm to encrypt your email a you will
have problems

403
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,949
because they we did the you are a
problem

404
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:34,889
so depends on the situation depends on
where you are

405
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:39,649
difference of what you want to protect
there is no

406
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:44,189
the magical solution have you ever used

407
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,330
ver true or heard about it

408
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,139
but with birds true how you are that is

409
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,540
its spelled the II are to you and it's a
solution to increase your emails

410
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,629
and send them securely and see

411
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,710
the recipient received it and if I

412
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,700
you misspelled the recipient address
again then revoked email

413
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,950
revoked Aki associated with your email
it might be a good solution

414
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,930
if you're corresponding with and trust
that person's no I just use pgp for

415
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,280
for a min yes I don't love to you
whatsoever

416
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,820
but never true is a free extension for
Firefox and Chrome

417
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,510
is open source is free and it doesn't
require for recipient to have anything

418
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,200
is sold

419
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,350
so it might be a good solution for you
