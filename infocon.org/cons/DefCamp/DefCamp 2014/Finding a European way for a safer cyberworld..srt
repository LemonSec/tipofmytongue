1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,280
we will have the next speaker will speak
about

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,920
fine even European Way for cyber world
integrating

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,840
our continent's military values let's
give a round of applause for La Ronge

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,840
thanks a lot

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,490
soldiers we before we

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,490
fix some technical problems and

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,910
just short introduction I'm
archaeologists have nothing to do here

8
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,529
story could theoretically since %uh
managing since a lot of

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,600
for time cyber security issues to

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,850
implement in rumania public-private
dialogue platform

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,250
and working several think tanks was
bringing sociological and

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,950
anthropological experience

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,329
this will be a talk much more

14
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,629
a about our values a

15
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,769
every country every continent

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,280
has its on values and are not perforce

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,650
compatible now the main challenge we can
face today

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,000
a is in fact the philosophy you know

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,259
with way according to which the state is
just tuning its own

20
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:18,920
traditional values the main problem is
that

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,009
we were speaking a lot this typical
abbreviation of

22
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,000
what counts sees a we're looking for

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,950
facts and not through some that's valid
only for not only for archaeology that's

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,439
what is of course for everything if it's
true that you want to go to a philosophy

25
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,869
class or to a church

26
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:39,299
are the main problem that is

27
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,790
actually killing Europe is that we a

28
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,890
are still in the canteen revolution the
Canton revolution press who pose

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,009
that you needs to understand everything
to get

30
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:54,670
a solution and if you don't it's pure
speculation

31
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,689
while our real European values that are
not the Russian

32
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:02,719
not the american %uh the Chinese values
there are completely different

33
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,199
our roots leave up good part to
interpretation

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,690
and in cybersecurity this interpretation
would lowers to fluctuate

35
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,950
here in Romania for example we had one
of the Pioneer lawyers

36
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,230
a you to do via who introduced

37
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,920
the capacitive the judges to interpret
the term

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,670
have a more or less flexible a

39
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,510
that was of course in the end of the
19th century beginning of the twenties

40
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,260
and of course after the two a word
conflicts we came back again to a very

41
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,000
cant im

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,570
system of Lowes now what does it mean
practically

43
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,160
that practically to make a

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,340
assault or to make decision

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,440
you must know everything that is
concerning the problem and then

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,100
you have up the solution well making
ever see a

47
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,410
so knowing everything that was so the
problem is something so few treating us

48
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,500
cybersecurity is absolutely impossible

49
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,430
so and four hours total and that's quite
interesting

50
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,690
up the deliberation is just what is

51
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,870
correct according to your moral values

52
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,280
and you can obtain a result with that

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,390
I hope it will not turn off okay

54
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,670
what's the most important thing in the

55
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,670
in this is it Dudley feats that
democracy

56
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,869
you the way we think it in europe a

57
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,310
I'm absolutely nom nom even these
appointed dimes

58
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,470
totally up angry of a

59
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,090
witnessing day after the a such an as a
patient of the word democracy

60
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,340
yeah we will build up democracy in Iraq
yes we are the

61
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,890
most democratic old country in the world
bullshit the rib democracy was born in

62
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,540
essence

63
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,329
it was more or less ray interpreted in a
strong state way

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,880
in Rome and then it was reborn in Europe
with the Lumia

65
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,720
up europe all the others just copied it
in their own interest

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,980
and we will see here what it does our
main problem

67
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,310
what is typically a county and
resentment toward world one our enemy

68
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,320
has this front he has one million people
we put 1.5 million people

69
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,120
against in the same frontline and let
them but should together

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,160
and that's okay I resolved my enemy

71
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,330
on the if half my troops dies is OK

72
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,490
another typically Canton how the German
as he's progressed with tanks

73
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,020
instead a few venting something else we
just right

74
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,080
to build better Texas soviet succeeded
with 234

75
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,770
the American succeeded more less in the
same time with the Sherman

76
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,580
but a gig with three years of delay in
three years have a lot of death because

77
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,370
instead of

78
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,840
buying girl building a good anti-tank
solutions to try to find a tank with a

79
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,289
tank

80
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:55,280
a what was our eyes to deletion use in
exchange

81
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,280
its a.m. typically with the way the
Romans did

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,609
and mainly when they had to face a so
many different

83
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,880
enemies for example in the zone we are
here in now

84
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,039
form a document vince's or even up

85
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,210
and other side of the Carpathians in the
doctor police insist they had to face

86
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,198
a Germanic tribes and its Germanic
tribes had the

87
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,289
mmm weakness the week is where that you
for entry and they have a very very

88
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,110
strong points that was a

89
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,590
hardcover re and the cap hardcover we a

90
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,590
was impossible to contain with the way
the Romans

91
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,510
a had their own cavalry organize so what
did they do and what to wear should

92
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,889
we do in Europe is that the conjugated
the talents

93
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,020
they had in their own empire citizens of
the empire so this tool you can see

94
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,750
there he was finding Kyron service

95
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,030
it bears the names to of one

96
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,289
we are trees are three steals of upon
Iranian archer's

97
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:56,630
that had their own temple their own car
isn't getting service and why is that

98
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,259
where there because there was a best
mounted archers

99
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,240
in the word than with that they defeated
the mark a month in the same zone of

100
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,349
certain is that it was a

101
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:08,830
and TB's commuter and service we had
also you I B rooms that were from this

102
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,949
so stone for Rose and we had also the
puny

103
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,310
so the Tunisian a job alert level

104
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,130
mounted devil it launches and with that
the state 100 years there is succeeded

105
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,409
to secure the border

106
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:24,449
a in the contrary and what's

107
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,159
that's very similar to what's happening
now art dealer didn't born was made not

108
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,259
born from nothing

109
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,750
idea was hostage in between you must
take the

110
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,520
the word as it was

111
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,070
because he was a son of one of the honey
kinks so it means that

112
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,930
all his yells he benefited of the best
professors and the best accommodation in

113
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,910
Constantinople

114
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,420
so he knew perfectly how the Roman
Empire worked

115
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,820
and that was his the key of his success
when he made the Razzie a

116
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,950
that never created an empire because
he's tried was among the tribe in

117
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,370
they're all their mean their gold was
not to create an empire

118
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,470
but that's what we're witnessing now we
are witnessing that

119
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,570
internet and the cyber problems which
where basically an American creation

120
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,659
can be used by anybody

121
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,710
that is simply learned to use the net so
everybody can use

122
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,060
cyber conflict or side or all cybercrime

123
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,890
following the techniques but in a very
different way

124
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,030
according to what the way he was
educated

125
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,190
in his own country now

126
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,630
we have a deeper problem now in your
open that's our main focus points when

127
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,680
we witness

128
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,060
how useless our laws mainly for social
media

129
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,400
and problems they riveting from that is
that

130
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,070
a we still a has a tendency to compare

131
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,560
the human rights a

132
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
made you by the French Revolution which
is

133
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,210
internationally adopt with the Bill of
Rights

134
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,370
which is American wait to interpret and
shorten it

135
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,500
Bill of Rights is just that they
revision at the beginning of

136
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,850
a the famous role of Cyrus who was a

137
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,160
king of pressuring the sixth century
that was the first right

138
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,419
to guarantee to everybody freedom of
religion freedom of

139
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:18,890
a work a know slavery and freedom of
choosing the place where

140
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,110
one wants to leave and of course is a

141
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm US Bill of Rights was a wonderful
performance in the time

142
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,430
he was it was redacted but now it goes

143
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,610
a lot of problems all what is illegal by
us

144
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,919
is legal in the US soil and then

145
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,409
in the US just tuned internet because
article one is freedom of expression

146
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,110
so how do we fight that well the
Americans found a very finely

147
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,550
typically cant im I have like a dumb I
stir in my own soil

148
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,819
he's free to express his own ideas he's
free to praise

149
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,150
jihad so I gave to the NSC powers to

150
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,640
by him well that's not very democratic

151
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,930
Turkish ways black screen simple

152
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,469
and done even declared recently you want
to pan out

153
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,220
Twitter from Turkey and that's a lot of
web sites you cannot enter even to the

154
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,860
Guardian

155
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,240
to leave your house you know if you're
in Turkish you haven't very nice display

156
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,190
forbidden

157
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,270
the taxes to do too the this is enough
to be another fun ca

158
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,030
okay that's another possibility but
sales also has nothing to do with our

159
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,390
european values

160
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,199
rush is much more complicated to have a
test style

161
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,020
a.m. very well implemented system of
security

162
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,970
that is a sore so miss some devices that
are Impala compulsory for the providers

163
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,550
furnished by KGB and KGB decides what to
do with this information but everything

164
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,770
is state centralizes no way

165
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,930
to provide this information or to
subtract

166
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,560
these storm to third parties a

167
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,550
and at least typically Russian to have a
face and the face is this guy you can

168
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,020
see

169
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,650
home in how many different fields he
worked and he is a responsible also for

170
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,140
the public-private dialogue so it's a
typical

171
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,930
Russian chest I'll the Russian Empire
plated the soviets plated

172
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,949
putting is now playing it it's not our
democratically

173
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,770
China is even simpler for inner China

174
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,740
thats when aside wants too far that's

175
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,220
a for reasons not to everyone and to
suppress our

176
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,670
extremely on how money is so what's the
site is voluntarily close for three days

177
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,740
mean three days you have altered his KGB
to clean it up and

178
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,720
to tell them how the reduction away has
two and then

179
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,590
with of course the hundreds of thousand
people of people

180
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,350
paid for deleting they can make exact
censorship not like turkey just to ban

181
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,850
all the the whole website of the Guardia

182
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,830
they just banned the pages that concerns
that China that means a whole

183
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,080
a a lot of a man working on that this

184
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,680
issue now what's our problem

185
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,219
is a one part of these problems you can
just

186
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,370
rhythms each six months on the

187
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,870
official website of the Swiss
Confederation which is Melanie which is

188
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,650
one of the most

189
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:17,340
neutral and a our main problem actually
is what we'll do

190
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,180
Microsoft's because they are ask for a
smoke from a small

191
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,849
US Court to give them all the data from
one client owes them

192
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,450
which are stocked in Dublin if they do
that

193
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,770
we have to expel Mike Russell from
Europe because it's simply a violation

194
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,020
of

195
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,830
all European laws a these data being
stocked

196
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,690
in Ireland now we'll see what will be
there unser they are trying

197
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,580
to ensure that they will not do it we
will see and the other thing that was a

198
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,420
real first impact but only a strong
democracies with someone could implement

199
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
that so

200
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,209
quickly after snow than we changed
everything its absolutely out of

201
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,740
questions that the Swiss Federal
Government

202
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,180
continues to implement American
materials point

203
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,199
and observe the M's up the game and

204
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,410
that is not only as you can see not only
for the military's

205
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,390
but mainly for fixed telephony for more
by for computers and for networks

206
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,530
that are in our county in the same time

207
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,189
although main international missed this
year Nov 'it's

208
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,400
if we speak for myself because I'll go
over early mentor they hired the famous

209
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,730
on ton of stuff can

210
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,770
bring 20 tanks and they brought 200 tons
of service from Seattle to Basel

211
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,730
and of the game there also so now

212
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,870
if we start to to looking about real

213
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,180
issues the best issues paradoxically

214
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,790
are from America because America is
extremely reactive

215
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,550
even if to Canton if we follow the
European rules

216
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,780
knowing what we have to expect with
Internet of Things

217
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,579
will find ourselves without that the
necessary to keep

218
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,690
for entering France for it UK citizen

219
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,250
that you need to have in your car from
the alcott this to the

220
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,589
a first a helper to everything that you
need to have

221
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,480
when we have that by European law in our
more buyers

222
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,120
not I hope not well an amazing capacity
of Americans is to

223
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,089
enter with new terms and one of these
new terms was in rockefeller

224
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,360
acts them this is very important because
it was issued in the same time that the

225
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,459
EU ciba cyber strategy act they are the
first that put

226
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,349
into law the term track
interdisciplinary we totally lacquers

227
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,579
items that could be

228
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:38,959
our strong our strengths and our deep
strengths against

229
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,160
any although economic or political force
in the world the word if we succeed to

230
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,819
unite

231
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:49,160
228 European countries because what does
it mean we r even not reaching

232
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,269
a interdisciplinary so or transit
disciplinary so we don't understand the

233
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:54,779
problem

234
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,160
the Americans really fixed who will are
meant to that

235
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,879
the National Science Foundation with the
help of an SCCA so on

236
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,939
and with the public private dela
platform and here we still

237
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:10,899
are too fragmented to do it the problem

238
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,670
basic problem that a Americans and a
student out

239
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,339
really paying some of my colleagues for
example of archaeology

240
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,480
to interact with the fermentation seen
that the

241
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,759
informatics as mathematics doubt though
less

242
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,360
interconnected a a disciplines

243
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,779
if you can see who is public publishing
in the all other

244
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:37,110
part a cool from inexact science is like
history archaeology is public seeing

245
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,529
in Exact Sciences a you can see all
these periods that culminated suites and

246
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,120
2 apology and Human Geography

247
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,089
on the other side almost nobody from
them is public eating in our publication

248
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,600
so we have a strong gap

249
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,399
and if we look at the size cybersecurity
of the

250
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,459
European Union well the only word is
facepalm

251
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:01,489
because a if you just see the phrase as
quoted by

252
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,370
Catherine Ashton declaration is just
okay we would have to do that

253
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,300
who opal ec3 the

254
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,729
chair detainees are no we will have to
encourage public-private partnership Hui

255
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,820
nobody so another time

256
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,410
one of the may be best examples and its
use

257
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,650
only by European presidents in cases of

258
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,370
some seeing that is not politics don't
want to assume political

259
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,110
responsibility its referendum a you know
that for example in France they just use

260
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,850
it because they don't want to do is a
%uh European Constitution

261
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,350
she liked it and wanted to say openly
I'm against so say

262
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,160
made a referendum but that the only
cases when they use real democracy

263
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,810
in Italy in France's Spain and so on a

264
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,790
we use its almost EC weeks sometimes was
catastrophic tool

265
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,770
effects that was a very racist
propaganda on the left of the Swiss

266
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,980
right parties to

267
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,300
expels foreigners that foreigners other
black sheeps

268
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,859
a the problem is as the Swiss citizens
voted for

269
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,170
a extended delay of assimilating a

270
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,120
foreign workers and %uh excluded us
immediately from

271
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,370
all that house was programs but at least
it was a popular

272
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,920
I'll I meet people went to vote in
that's a majority who decided it

273
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,360
what is much more interesting there is
that next year will vote on that

274
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,760
its part early should do that comes from
a

275
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,700
the young parliamentary that told we
have the right to choose if you buy a

276
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,110
free go if we buy

277
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,280
car if it's wifey connected or not and
if

278
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,780
not they will have to take out any kind
of Internet of Things devise for my

279
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,310
fridge

280
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,109
mainly do after the famous American kids
that was quoted even by the CIA it

281
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,380
headquarters of hunting a frigid there
somewhere

282
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,530
in American stay that was sending sixty
solvent

283
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,339
us bombs per minute so at least we will
vote

284
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,470
and I think these is the real way Europe
could go forward

285
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,030
in the problems which are actually

286
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,480
a

287
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,079
hours in the field of cyber security a
bit more

288
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,109
interaction between the country's more
interaction between the disciplines

289
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:16,719
and at the end a final vote because up

290
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,310
you're speaking my the previous speakers
spoke a lot about scudder

291
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,149
the main problem is not others might not
a problem is even not

292
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,410
a internet security because we learned
through

293
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,740
a history that there will always be
somebody

294
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,960
that has a means to spy you that's

295
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,630
with democracy freedom a hidden eyepiece
is just bullshit

296
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,160
I just depend how dangerous you are
because if you become too dangerous

297
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,160
even with hidden IP's or anything you
just will

298
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,670
be spied as good as you were spied in
antiquity or

299
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,880
a is a last century the second problem

300
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,900
is that we have witnessed with his
bank's or was problem of

301
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,390
in a industrial spying with Swiss
watches it's much

302
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,750
easier to do three million bribe to an
employee what the German lender made a

303
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,360
lot of times was always with banks to
get the least of who is making

304
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,560
fiscal division then to enter this code
of the courtesies

305
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,389
is this I just bribe the guy and that's
a little bit what

306
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,590
we supposed to know about houses tux
mature is working I'm

307
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,929
they had to be have somebody inside so
that insider is much

308
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,900
much much more a dangerous than any kind
of

309
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,810
external attack that doesn't diminish
the scud attacks but this cut taxes what

310
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,790
happened for example before the Georgian
war

311
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,399
and these was also due to a very very
bad

312
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,740
Jordan infrastructure how the
implemented the intranet explain it

313
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,260
under

314
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,370
a critical infrastructure network of
course

315
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,520
if we have a war the first a wave of
this war will be again the critical

316
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,330
infrastructures

317
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,169
but I doubt a group of hikers which is
not extremely well-financed will

318
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,540
make a massive scud attack the problem
is inside the problem these

319
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,530
in Europe for each one of us to reflect
which kind of data we put on the net on

320
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,389
which cites

321
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,510
and how and of course

322
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,500
now the main difference before of

323
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,639
between the generation which is born now
which is majority here

324
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:21,490
and my generation that we were not born
with that so we are much more

325
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,730
commercials when we put a photo or text
on Facebook the young generation had

326
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,240
tendency to put everything

327
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,990
and everything start from the final user

328
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,980
that's a deal and that the only way by
knowledge are the final user will find a

329
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,879
European

330
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:40,158
solution you respect to our traditions
thank you very much
