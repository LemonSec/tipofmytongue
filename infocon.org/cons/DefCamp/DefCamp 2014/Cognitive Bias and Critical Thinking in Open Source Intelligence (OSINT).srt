1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,449
I hello everybody I I'm gonna be
speaking to about

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,910
open source intelligence and looking at
how cognitive bias ease

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,509
and critical thinking I can impact open
source intelligence analysis

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,100
so little bit about myself my name is
Benjamin brown

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,420
I work for Akamai Technologies large
content delivery network

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,119
and I work on the external network the
Internet

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,560
essentially a doing system safety
complex systems analysis

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,459
a novel security research for novel
attacks

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,840
and threatened Telligent yes it's a
buzzword but that's the world we're

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,540
gonna be swimming in here the threat
intelligence

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:45,289
security intelligence APT that's what
stuff I meant to give you some

12
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,300
a ideas and contacts about what we're
talking about here the world is

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,739
cognitive bias ease

14
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:55,890
open source intelligence I metacognition
we'll get into that a little bit later

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,239
critical thinking and then specific
frameworks for structured analysis

16
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,410
open source intelligence art

17
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,070
so why should we care about this well

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,759
a lot of our decisions both on the
strategic level and the operational

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,369
level

20
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:16,350
I are born out of I this sort of

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,259
actionable intelligence that we've come
up with and we're suing that its

22
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,820
accurate conclusions that we that have
been properly framed for us

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,339
I am but a lot of times we're not taking
into account

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,049
is that cognitive bias ease also called
faulty heuristics

25
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,930
are putting pressure on the intelligence
analysis process

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,040
and having us the lead to inaccurate
conclusions which

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,530
then have us make poor decisions so

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,340
what can we do about that well one place
look is metacognition in critical

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,899
thinking

30
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,070
where they allow us to do is recognize
and correct for his cock into bias

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,039
and they also allows to arrive at more
accurate solutions

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,210
more often so

33
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,380
a higher level view here give you a
picture you have bad data

34
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,519
and biased analysis and they're feeding
into false conclusions

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,750
these false conclusions are generating
bad intelligence

36
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,050
and we're making poor decisions

37
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,370
space on this bad intelligence what does
that lead to

38
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,220
apocalypse an armageddon

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,940
yeah that might seem a little

40
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,050
you know over the top I into a bit over

41
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,870
hyperbole but if anybody here is
familiar with

42
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,560
the Bay of Pigs incident where a cuban
missile crisis: that's exactly what

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,980
happened

44
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,040
we're headed for a very very bad state
of affairs

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,929
based on bad intelligence and poor
analysis that was heavily biased

46
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,060
now I'm laid some groundwork for what
i'm talking about. I say open source

47
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,890
intelligence

48
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,179
so the US Army

49
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,600
I they say that open source intelligence
is intelligence that's produced from

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,680
publicly available information

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,830
what is publicly available information
well

52
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,080
we're talking about publicly available
information the typical quality

53
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,990
leaves a lot to be desired it's like

54
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,000
the inquire the sea at the grocery
checkout store something like that

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,459
a lot of times it's crap so

56
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,989
what we need to do well when it's out
there in the public

57
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,660
and it's crap it's usually just data
it's not actually intelligence

58
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,200
they can be acted upon this is where we
need to discern

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,339
for ourselves between information

60
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,330
or data in actual intelligence
intelligence comes out

61
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,810
love analysis intelligence has three
markers

62
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,810
its timely it's relevant and its
actionable

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,180
I

64
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,470
so since this is open source
intelligence where we getting this

65
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,209
information

66
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,410
we're not getting it from confidential
informants or anything like that

67
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,459
um we're getting it from search engines
like Google

68
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,430
or if you hate yourself being I social
networks

69
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,680
read it people say way too much on
Reddit about themselves

70
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,070
I am also communications services like
ir see

71
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,570
so alive and well I if you're from the
eastern bloc

72
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,649
ICQ still very much alive which is weird
to me um

73
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:21,250
also e-commerce site profiles somebody's
Amazon history especially there are

74
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,039
commenting history is very interesting

75
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,219
are also doing I'm business and tax

76
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,850
searches especially in the US these are
very easy to find lots of information

77
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,780
about

78
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,750
business owners people who arco owners

79
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,050
in business entities themselves on the
state level

80
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,340
the a county-level and federal level of
course

81
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,440
another place to get open source
intelligence

82
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,330
a is the media but you want to take that
with a grain of salt because this is

83
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,840
information that is coming out love
eighties very specific

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,539
viewpoint for a very upset specific said
purposes

85
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:04,430
so you want to take the whole context
into a cap so what kinda tools are

86
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:11,430
useful for gathering this what
information the record in G

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,719
so I'm a bit of a cold here Enrique on
angie is

88
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,220
a really cool framework mice just
everybody here even if

89
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,919
arm open source intelligence isn't your
thing go check out our econ and you get

90
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:25,640
a lot of fun

91
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,580
and really creepy on exit storm

92
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,719
you can get lots of cool stuff from
accept data from photos and other

93
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,830
piece is a media things like the GPS
coordinates and the device that was used

94
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,740
I take the photo the harvester

95
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,030
it's really good for analyzing E
companies or entities

96
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,549
finding all the email addresses that are
publicly available for them

97
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,190
which is great for social engineering or
spear phishing on

98
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,350
multi go multi goes great because it
allows our brain

99
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,360
disorder shortcuts sum up the buyer sees
by looking at the data in a completely

100
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,150
different way

101
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,140
we're not seeing it in a traditionalist
we're seeing it as a visualization

102
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,640
as a web of connections which allow us
to come up with

103
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,300
other ideas are ways of thinking about
the data right

104
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,340
so let's talk about cocking device and I
tell you

105
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,419
what i'm talking about. with cognitive
bias first time I tell you what I'm not

106
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:22,219
talking about

107
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,880
I'm not talking about anything to do
with faith-based

108
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,219
or spiritual or religious cultural
things like that

109
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,520
and those words have by Cesar heuristics
are

110
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,090
but

111
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,849
are at issue here what I am talking
about

112
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:42,090
is the way that our brain deals with the
massive amounts of information

113
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,099
that are just pouring towards us all the
time so

114
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:49,690
we've got information coming from all
over senses just being fed and

115
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,659
constantly

116
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:54,879
and how our brain deals with all that
stuff just having a stock analysis

117
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,759
paralysis

118
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,530
is we have the shortened patterns
subjective judgment

119
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,239
the simplified processing strategies
that allow us to take shortcuts with a

120
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,490
little bit of information

121
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,780
so I'll give an example

122
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,849
a on how we don't actually see things

123
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:14,419
as they are out in the world are bring
the deuces them based on

124
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:18,530
different snippets of information so for
be look at this

125
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,869
the photo appear I am sections

126
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,629
a in sections be that are marked the
squares here

127
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,310
aids in the top left B is in the center
looks like

128
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,789
a is darker than be is that pretty much
what everybody else sees

129
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,190
you okay on so

130
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,169
what's weird about this is that a.m.
beer the exact same color

131
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,349
if I were to take the color picker

132
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:47,229
or take this into Photoshop AMB would
have the exact same color value

133
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,180
but that's not what I brain is is
producing are telling us that is going

134
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,819
on there

135
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,580
is looking at the different information
about the checkerboard pattern

136
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,380
the angle the dimensions it looks it's
looking at the Chateau

137
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,639
being lane across by the subject and
that's saying 0

138
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,740
well because I've always little bits of
information

139
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,940
a must be dark and be must be light well
that's not actually the case

140
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,000
if I can happen with her eyes

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,819
where else can that happen

142
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:22,389
right so I'll give you I'll start
breaking down

143
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,990
cognitive bias and two some very
specific subset supplies

144
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,360
sees this one a lot of people here have
probably heard a confirmation bias

145
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,219
so a when you're going to do research

146
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,219
we're going to look for some information
a

147
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,130
it's very normal for human being
disorder have in the back

148
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,760
their head an idea Bell how it's
probably gonna turn out

149
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,000
with the case probably is that's a
little insidious and that

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,019
when that's working in your subconscious
that idea about

151
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,779
this is probably what the right answer
is you are

152
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,250
either consciously or unconsciously and
denying

153
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,000
certain types of information that go
against what you think might be true

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,680
endured just specifically looking for
information that fits what you think is

155
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,849
our teacher in the world

156
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,329
you're really missing a lot and not
really doing much for yourself in terms

157
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:14,349
of analysis

158
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,070
I another one

159
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,380
and this one we see Mario doing with
Yoshi all the time

160
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,329
is self-serving bias always looking at
self enhancement

161
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:29,420
self-preservation self-esteem and social

162
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,490
work free against and I want to be very
specific and

163
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,360
and living you guys know that I'm not
saying these biases are inherently bad

164
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,890
they're useful they serve a purpose they
allow us to conduct ourselves as

165
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,019
beings in a social setting but

166
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,410
they also cause us to do act and think
in ways that can be detrimental to

167
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,939
intelligence analysis

168
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,510
another one is the echo effect this one

169
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,189
we see a lot more lately with things
like Twitter

170
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,000
Facebook a you gets these like it's a
game

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,339
media telephone you get these little
snippets of stories

172
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,880
we don't actually know where the sources
but repeated over and over and over

173
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,519
again

174
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,940
and maybe changes a little bit each time
it's repeated this causes things like

175
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,190
the bandwagon effect

176
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,899
it promotes groupthink and inherently
humans as we're seeing this piece of

177
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:22,570
data

178
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,850
produce over and over and over again
it's starting to gain weight and

179
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,279
credibility in our minds

180
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,670
even if it doesn't have anything to do
with reality

181
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,079
um

182
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,930
this bias is a little bit more in-depth
are involved

183
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,339
it's the representativeness bias this
one is we're focusing on similarities

184
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:46,180
and we're neglecting the differences and
systems and I'll give you some examples

185
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,290
a this specifically later but when the
classic tales

186
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,560
representative and ness bias is the some

187
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,599
therefore blind men and the elephant
well one is feeling the trunk and saying

188
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,029
oh this must be a snake

189
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:03,260
one is feeling the tail saying oh this
must be a rope and so on and so forth

190
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,240
they're only looking at the very small
section of the entire picture and making

191
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,800
an assumption about what's going on

192
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,060
I one other subsets of this bias

193
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,339
is the base rate neglect bias this one
very call this one you'll sees

194
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,380
specifically when media tries to throw
at you really scary-looking statistics

195
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,430
which you want to look at is the base
rate what's the

196
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,099
actual rate for their base that they're
using and

197
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,139
a specific tool that you can use for
this is based here

198
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:36,940
so this is based here in here if
anybody's taken

199
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,130
I don't know house high school or a you
know

200
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,510
two-year college statistics you probably
had to do something with us

201
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,910
it actually is useful especially in
Summit Road 230 da statistics such

202
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,910
so availability bias this one is

203
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:04,430
one we don't really think about a lot um

204
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,859
and this has to do with things like I in
a data anecdotal data

205
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,620
I where the human mind inherently

206
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,600
really really likes first or second hand
accounts

207
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,420
to relate even if we read something into
a well renowned scholarly journal

208
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,199
were less likely to give that the same
way that we we would give a story from

209
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:25,949
our friend

210
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:29,959
even if our friend has no way of knowing
anything close to

211
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,369
you know what the person who wrote that
scholarly our local

212
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,510
and this is just how we develop a social
creatures

213
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,500
and topics from power again

214
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,600
a hearkening back to where we talked
about the

215
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,060
echo effect I inherently we're gonna
start giving something that we see over

216
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,560
and over again more weight

217
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,859
on censorship what are we missing that
we don't know we're missing because it's

218
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,300
being

219
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,099
start censorship are we actually making
notes have that

220
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,360
gaps in information also

221
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,410
how many languages are you fluent and
and

222
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,150
how many UHV the dialects and some
context

223
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:13,589
and subcultures within those languages
are you able to really pull out all

224
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,930
the meaning is this going to affect the
type of data

225
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,020
I in the way you're analyzing your data
if you only speak English

226
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,490
and you only live in the midwest you're
only gonna be understanding

227
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,410
the context love you know people that
are posting information from the midwest

228
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,520
speaking English

229
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,720
you're gonna miss out a whole lot of
other stuff also

230
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,740
on this masking of ca this is something
that

231
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,570
the russians have as a very specific
part

232
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,710
love their core a military intelligence
platform and

233
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,260
subjection have this is disinformation
and

234
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,339
they employed it better than anybody
else especially during the Cold War

235
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:59,020
and it was a ingenious how they did

236
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,870
I'm one of their main tactics was the
flood communication channels

237
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,330
with lots and lots of false information
okay

238
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,350
yeah let's care either you know
overwhelming you with false information

239
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,350
but was really clever is they would also
put in

240
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,560
true information why's that clever

241
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,109
well if it's just a bunch of false
information you look for the gaps

242
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,630
that's probably where the truth is but
if it's true information

243
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,760
and false information mixed together
it's just noise which is really hard to

244
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,480
analyze

245
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,860
and you see this the and when

246
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,010
anonymous these days is being used as a
false flag operation

247
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,770
or another of the spun up underneath
another one you can start to see this

248
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,490
makes

249
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,440
love false information which you
information two actors with false actors

250
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,709
art so I give you much a theory

251
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:51,479
let's look at these things in the real
world now this is the

252
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,820
one that I was actually present for um

253
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,110
when I was in Boston during the past
bombings

254
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,420
I was you know of course with everybody
else looking for more information

255
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,120
trying to find out what's going on and a
group on reddit

256
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,130
a very large group decided to play
internet police

257
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,180
I'm not gonna figure out who committed
the Boston bombings and

258
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,540
I am you know they can definitely do a
much better job than highly trained

259
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,230
professionals

260
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,370
so

261
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,140
some other methodology they would look
at

262
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,220
publicly posted marathon photos or
videos and they would try and pick out

263
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,570
who they felt wasn't paying enough
attention to the race

264
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,530
at that specific moment in the photo I
also

265
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,329
they would take E snippets the police
scanner

266
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,770
data out of context if anybody here

267
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,780
does a lot of %uh emergency service
radio work

268
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,860
and then you probably know that yes

269
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,640
there arm open channels but they change

270
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,939
and there's also include two channels
which have more data that goes with the

271
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,880
open channels

272
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,170
they have courses have access to that
data source very much without context

273
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,930
they started naming multiple suspects
based on this very bad

274
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,030
open source intelligence they were
developing now

275
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:13,189
if it was n a a bubble or vacuum by
itself that wouldn't be so bad

276
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,480
but what we're really got that was when
international media started picking up

277
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:17,970
on

278
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,030
the people who they were claiming
probably did the bombing it's a repeat

279
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,750
its are giving a credibility so the
media outlets started running bad info

280
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,440
from Reddit

281
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,000
and I'll show you a there's

282
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,220
a a show newsroom they did a very good
piece on the specifically

283
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:42,220
they just recently found

284
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:49,819
no Tripathi was a student at Brown he
was reported missing about a month ago

285
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:52,939
as family set up a Facebook page for
anyone who might have information about

286
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,800
where he is

287
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,649
yesterday 5 p.m. in response to
Thursday's post front page miss

288
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,509
identifying

289
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:02,709
to innocent people as enemies of the
state the FBI issued these photos of the

290
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,059
actual suspects now

291
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,410
here's what happened next within minutes
users on reddit all got together and

292
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,970
decided that the best thing to do

293
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,400
step back and let the professionals do
their jobs they began comparing the FBI

294
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,910
photo of one of the suspects in your
capacity

295
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,140
by 10 p.m. to become a leading theory on
reddit the capacity was suspect number

296
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,659
two

297
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:24,679
at 2:43 this morning a man named Greg
Hughes tweeted that the Boston Police

298
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,890
can identify the names of the suspects
as Mike really get a and similar path

299
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,600
earlier in the night Greg user tweeted
2013 all you need is a connection to the

300
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,418
Boston Police scanner and a Twitter feed
to know what's up we don't even the TV

301
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:36,990
anymore

302
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,630
now it tells I just bought a new class a
big play it is baby doll or

303
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,309
seven minutes after the Greg Hughes
tweet Kevin Galliford a cameraman for

304
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,799
Harper CBS affiliate

305
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,750
picks up on you sorry the relays the
same information to his followers

306
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,130
moments after that

307
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,200
reporter at BuzzFeed sends 2.2 is 81,000

308
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,600
follow her portrait BuzzFeed has
eighty-one thousand followers

309
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,209
I know you have one him just funny I
like your jokes

310
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,130
a folly and not on Twitter really really

311
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,760
wonderment phone guys peace the BuzzFeed
tweet says while read it was right

312
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,280
suspect identified as cynical Tripathi

313
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,510
two questions do we know who Greg uses
is a guy on reddit

314
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,549
second question is that by this point it
243 this morning is anyone in our

315
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,700
network checked on Samuel Tripathi
course we have and

316
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,240
by senior officials with the FBI 3 with
the justice department including one

317
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,260
from the attorney general's office
another five from the Boston PD

318
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,390
all of them willing to be identified on
the record all of them categorically

319
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,039
denying that's not too bad he is a
suspect

320
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,129
also the Secretary of Homeland Security
going to put their circle be up against

321
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,179
Greg you certainly I don't know who the
hell do believe 2:57 a.m. 14 minutes

322
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:44,200
after the first week

323
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,630
NBC News correspondent weeks the
sendmail Tripathi

324
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,910
theory is 180,000 followers a hundred

325
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,170
80,000 at least integrated with their
half hour later press helped send the

326
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:55,500
dow

327
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,520
I didn't want to miss six million unit
celebrates that readiness of the bombing

328
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,570
john king is a stooge posters are
responsible and the FBI

329
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:11,570
is inept see you see how quickly that
wildfire spread right

330
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,720
turns out a similar property

331
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,860
I am had been missing because he had
drowned

332
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,840
so his family is not only having to deal
with all this going on

333
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,939
across the media arm and harassment and

334
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,570
a you know people calling and threats to
them but

335
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,110
other also grieving their dead son so
there's a real world impact

336
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,679
to this right so what biases were in
effect here

337
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,040
well the bandwagon effect for sure the
actual fact availability bias

338
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,030
the ability of the information they had
and didn't have self-serving bias

339
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,590
there's Carmen internet points to be had
I also confirmation bias

340
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,230
which here was rather insidious because
all the people that got to the top of

341
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,580
their list of people that they were
naming a suspect's

342
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,510
where brown males surprise

343
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,400
turns out the guys were actually did it
were as wide as you can get because they

344
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
were actually from the caucuses

345
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,350
they were Caucasian right

346
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,899
APT drink and so

347
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,360
in the US I don't know if it's the same
here but in the US when somebody says

348
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,959
advanced persistent threat people

349
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,610
lebowe like oh my god China a

350
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,939
so a lot of companies who have put out

351
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,590
threat intelligence reports I'm calling
out China

352
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,659
have looked at a lot of open source a
information

353
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,810
a and connected the dots like the

354
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,090
the typeof wrap that was used remitted
ministration pool

355
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,909
which anybody can use really the same
type geolocation between the control

356
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:57,769
the used Macs mind really accurate right
guys

357
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:00,929
I'm also looking at shared similarities
with past APT's

358
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:04,389
what we say about representative nest
that's just looking at shared

359
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,199
similarities

360
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,539
it name a single difference between past
APT's

361
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:12,320
now two authors native language

362
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,968
was also brought into question this is
the of their

363
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:19,869
a free tool that was posted online that
these guys happen to use

364
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:24,468
I don't know why that has anything to do
with anything essentially came down to

365
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:25,859
where expert researchers

366
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:30,549
just trust us but turns out the all
these expert researchers

367
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:34,999
works for vendors that would also sell
you a solution to a PT

368
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:39,279
yeah hey so some other things you wanna
look at

369
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,460
is what's the population a base rate on

370
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,460
for the communicant role servers that
they're using

371
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,399
in the population to the area's the
ability of the information that they had

372
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:55,330
I and again as vendors this was very
much a self-serving bias at work here

373
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,749
some other areas were in a run through
quickly that

374
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:01,839
you can actually look and see these
biases and a fact

375
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,609
doc Singh doc Singh is wrong

376
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:09,259
like it they get it wrong so often it's
not even funny

377
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:12,739
and the call out real people who have to
then

378
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:17,210
change the name change their job because
they got about DAX dropped them

379
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,109
adidas attacks and

380
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:24,809
you know there's a lot of odd the
uncertainty and doubt around that use

381
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:25,349
your

382
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:29,389
based there and look at the base rate
your look at this this is cool

383
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,629
methodology that the use

384
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:33,988
what is the sample size how long have
they been collecting the data you tell

385
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:34,929
me there's been

386
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,339
increase have 1,152 percent in

387
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,908
NTP reflection attacks 0 you've only
been collecting data over the past three

388
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:43,460
months

389
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,009
well of course that numbers would be
huge because there was a recent spike

390
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:53,529
but it starts normalize overtime a
newsweek outing the quote-unquote

391
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:54,440
creator

392
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,259
pick one on yeah how's that going for
them

393
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:04,080
there in their second-round uva being
sued and the

394
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,460
search for the Malaysian Air Race flight
image 370

395
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,019
the song was really interesting

396
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:12,769
and this is the culmination this picture
the combination love hours and hours of

397
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:13,889
tedious research

398
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:17,379
on through open source information to
find the downed plane

399
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:20,629
and when this group a outed that they
had found it

400
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:24,719
turns out this photo they got from
Google Maps

401
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,729
which is updated in real time right

402
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:34,009
right so what do we do

403
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:37,179
metacognition thinking about thinking

404
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:41,269
so you wanna ask yourselves

405
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,429
when dealing with any data that you're
you know gonna assume to be true

406
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:50,509
USA what do I think I know how do I
think I know it

407
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:55,460
and when would it not be true and this
is just

408
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,470
generally good three good questions to
ask you know throughout the day to

409
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,029
yourself and your regular life

410
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:04,710
what do I think I know how do I think I
know it

411
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:11,710
and when would it not be true I

412
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,029
also there's another thing to look out
for in this is getting a little matter

413
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:19,690
it's the bias bias or the bias blind
spot this is the belief that your

414
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,509
personal bias

415
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:24,109
is actually insight and it gets worse

416
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:28,269
throughout the research by Emily prone
and at the Princeton University

417
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:31,580
and she finds that a

418
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,449
a lot of people report being less
susceptible to bias themselves

419
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,269
and they will be likely to infer bias
and others especially

420
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:44,659
when they hold a contrary opinion so not
only is my bias actually in sight

421
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:50,960
but you have some huge by is going on
over there so you can actively seek out

422
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,779
your review

423
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:55,320
divers outside expertise in alternative
mindsets that will help to mitigate some

424
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,849
of that

425
00:24:55,849 --> 00:25:00,570
but doctor Richard sure says that
similar to an optical illusion

426
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,658
not fair that you on on they remain
compelling

427
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:09,749
even when you're fully aware their
nature so we can implement frameworks

428
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:13,220
one is the structure checklist for
analysts

429
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,159
and I can give you the extended slides
for these you can actually go through

430
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,109
them slowly

431
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:20,649
and that one was developed by the CIA

432
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:21,799
I back

433
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:24,970
in the sixties to you helps have their

434
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,190
their intelligence become more and more
useful up

435
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,730
and the second was a structured analytic
techniques for improving intelligence

436
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,860
analysis

437
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,379
this one has diagnostic techniques
contrarian techniques and imaginative

438
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:38,539
thinking techniques

439
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:43,879
and it tells you when to use things like
doubles at BC

440
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:47,418
team 18b analysis which is a lot of fun
I'll

441
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:50,929
a high-impact low-probability analysis
Black Swan analysis

442
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:54,429
I'm sure some of you are aware of that
also what if analysis

443
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:59,100
XL has a plugin for that one I

444
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,519
and they give you a time line for

445
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,619
when each of these things would be more
useful and when you've got a lot of you

446
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,408
were

447
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:11,279
a lot of your data and analysis RTN you
can play a really good devil's advocate

448
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,019
that's why that's towards the back and
throughout the whole thing you wanna be

449
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,669
doing your key assumptions checks

450
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:19,720
what do I think I know how do I think I
know it

451
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,029
and when would it not be true so what do
we do in the application of these

452
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:30,129
well when we're putting out a reports or
are

453
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:34,309
stating our intelligence we wanna say
what's our goal here

454
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:39,539
make it very clear who were sources
who's the audience were targeting

455
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:43,929
and please give your limitations on
assumptions this one's missed a lot

456
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:49,659
but more important than any of these
show me your methodology

457
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:53,679
I'm not gonna just take your word for it
that you're an expert researcher and I

458
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,759
should just trust you

459
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,239
I want to be able to repeat what you did
an hour other people to be able to

460
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,580
repeat what i've repeating

461
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,889
that's how science works so there's a
for some further research that would be

462
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:06,389
great

463
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:09,709
i'm looking at the tools were talking
about before

464
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,509
they have bake them bias looking at the
cultural and economic context the data

465
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:15,190
arises

466
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,249
date is not in a vacuum so this data
that we're using to build intelligence

467
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:24,100
it has its own historical context its
own chain before got to us

468
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,779
and pressures on it before got to us so
analyzing all of that

469
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,029
and a lot of times date is created by
human beings

470
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:34,679
who also have their biases that work
some mitigating for that as a whole

471
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:35,299
nother

472
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:39,950
realm of research so

473
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,669
I'd like to hear you know from from
olive you

474
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:47,450
course hands you know I think we can
really take

475
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,039
threat intelligence out of the realm
I'll lining the pockets vendors

476
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:55,789
and into the realm actually doing good
for the people in the world

477
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:59,840
and making an impact in protecting
people and having a safer environment

478
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,699
online an essay for digital life I

479
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:10,700
thank you and I ready to take questions
yet to be on the website also

480
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:27,988
if you email me on I I can give you even
more extended slides

481
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:31,049
which give a allister on readings

482
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:35,179
there's one reading that's a lotta fun
its it's called managerial decision

483
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,059
making but as a bunch exercises and

484
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:40,359
allow you to see your own bias ease
right from your face at work

485
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:46,830
at a little freaky okay

486
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,789
so thank you so much for the
presentation
