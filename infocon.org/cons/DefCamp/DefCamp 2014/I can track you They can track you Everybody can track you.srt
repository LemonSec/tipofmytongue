00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:03,740
okay good afternoon good evening to
everyone thank you

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,019
for coming to this last presentation def
can't

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:12,860
2000 14 so and my name is

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,419
me go to Vegas II I mean in for sex

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,390
sense doing for money said since 2006

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,539
but I starting this world nice 14 as a
technological

7
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:29,189
trouble-maker let stocking in this

8
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,940
in this Terms Celsus 2015 I start
selling

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,559
my my skills and start doing and testing
security out its

10
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,000
malware analysis now currently I mean
the

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,090
is incident response incident handling

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,360
field and

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,320
of course I'm working currently for us
small ways it's information security

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,930
company

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,600
Portuguese 1.college don't mean so

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,930
and today we'll talk basically

17
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,799
how technology can be used to track a
sore

18
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,010
how get can technology can betray

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,070
our our steps and can betray

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,350
where our privacy and

21
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,780
in this case I will only focused and mob
I'll

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,150
mobile devices but currently I am
studying

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,390
made researcher

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,499
other protocols and

25
00:01:28,499 --> 00:01:31,109
other fields but currently in this
presentation will

26
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:34,658
on this flocking in mobile devices and
while Wireless

27
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,319
technology saw

28
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,899
once again what is this I'll about

29
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:45,939
how mobile devices in this case
smartphones

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,148
or tablet can leak information

31
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:52,630
sensitive in from information how can
our

32
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,068
opponent adversary a person group

33
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,929
company and intelligence agency or
government

34
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:03,140
can exploit it can gather that
information and

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,479
can exploited against you or against
group of people

36
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,598
and alt little all temp

37
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,328
last resource how can they use that
information

38
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:17,549
to to track you down and to follow you

39
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:21,150
not in real time but

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,230
can give you and a good

41
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,260
can gave him very good view

42
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,730
where you work

43
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,190
where you live and what what kind of
places

44
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,880
to you used to to visit cell

45
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,710
what is this now all about i'm hopeful

46
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,140
do a lot using evidence and into courts

47
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,529
this is not mobile tracking 101

48
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,320
its there's other several

49
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,750
waste to do it I will just focused in

50
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,840
in one of the ways and of course

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,010
don't to and we think

52
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,940
illegal I don't know what are the laws
in in Romania Korean other countries

53
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,030
even in Portugal it was a very very gray

54
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,640
gray area and I need to contact some
national cert

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,959
some some lawyer friends to try to to
understand

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,670
if if this kind of activity even if it
was

57
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,709
just for research it was legal of not

58
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,550
and even those people were okay possibly
this is legal

59
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,650
possibly possible okay we'll give it a
shot

60
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,870
so this

61
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,100
currently just in in the image to to
show you

62
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,400
everybody North evolution of ten years

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,860
I can call little back in time I still
remember my

64
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,489
my first mobile phone

65
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,860
of of my father entries 93 94 in prison
use mobile phone

66
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,840
occupy all not all the car but it is
completely huge

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,010
with with the back than 10 years later

68
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,630
was SMS GSM

69
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,150
little games and then 10 again

70
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,780
10 years later again and we have small

71
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,450
computers in our pockets with processors
RAM

72
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,950
applications and operating system

73
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,229
and they their own programming language

74
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:30,990
to developed certain kind of tools so
this are some numbers

75
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,030
of smartphone its Portuguese

76
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,929
later soul currently currently into
until

77
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,470
did last year it was more or less 35

78
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,910
of of our population have smartphones is

79
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,229
3.5 millions we have an increase per
year of

80
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,250
50 50 percent so

81
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,310
into total amount of users

82
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,600
were less forty-percent as a mobile
phone worth

83
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,710
smartphone sorry so

84
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,419
this is just for

85
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,878
information purposes okay

86
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,389
let's about talk once again even more
nowadays

87
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:20,919
with with deformation that

88
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,930
at were snowed and provide to to the
world

89
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,530
there was a peak mess out about

90
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,619
what is it even that possible

91
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,210
to to to someone or to work report
government to

92
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,258
two tractors donato or or from spy in

93
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,970
worldwide and I started

94
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,470
this this instigation to to learn a
little bit

95
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,669
about that and

96
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,198
the conclusion for myself yes it is true

97
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,090
only only two only using only gathering
information of

98
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,840
wifi Wireless salt this is normally

99
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,669
what happened when your smartphone or
tablet or computer

100
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,120
I try to connect with them

101
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,290
to a router an access point said the
probe request

102
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,460
hey I society whatever are you there

103
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,930
than the access point we'll

104
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,220
as for it yes ms II and

105
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,710
SSID that you're looking for please you
can

106
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,549
you can you can connect and your
smartphone or devices

107
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,910
will connected Sol

108
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,080
and this is standard

109
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,700
its I don't know wide internet thing
internet

110
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,080
Engineering Task Force was this a good
idea

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,450
just that all devices should

112
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,490
save to last societies that were
connected

113
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,820
and once that device

114
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,409
find found and an access point or

115
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,930
wireless network with the same SSID try
to connect

116
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,990
automatically don't ask just

117
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,980
connect but for that process

118
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,590
to begin they need to always send

119
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,890
all societies they were

120
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,860
connected ond on the previous I'll

121
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,250
our devices save that kind

122
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,250
are information and send it in the wild

123
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,780
cell wise nice so important

124
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,099
so we have a device smartphone with a
wireless technology

125
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,420
we have mac Address

126
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,460
the same and that mac Address

127
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,760
will lead us two-person so

128
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,170
mac Address unique added to fire per
person

129
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,130
saw this is currently

130
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,659
little bit outdated

131
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,460
I O S currently only saves three last
connect

132
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,930
SSID is and a leak it out currently I
believe the US

133
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,740
8 now just I'm

134
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,510
Fort Jen's right it depends a lot of the
vendors

135
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,580
and diversions bat beware

136
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,090
with the new and you enter 5 not sure I
believe the lollipop

137
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,219
looks like even if you have your WiFi

138
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,520
is able day still collecting it

139
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,909
and certain applications and

140
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,319
shoppers operating system as access to

141
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,430
all wireless networks that

142
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,709
are surrounding you Windows Phone I

143
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,420
don't don't have any database since this
is a standard

144
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,610
and probably he'd be hastened

145
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,320
in this way so best way to compete just
two

146
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,700
to collect this this coming week
information with

147
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,399
with narrow down opened

148
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,809
open source and tools just to coffee or
our

149
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:11,149
Wireless devices to be

150
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:14,819
a receptive to be a passive just to to

151
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:18,128
on passive monitor mode and it is

152
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:21,999
is example of what kind with permission
you can

153
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:25,430
gay access you see that

154
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,930
discount mac Address the first all
network

155
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,059
on bus began mates it

156
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:36,480
it's it's a very famous portuguese mall
cell

157
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,819
and why is this a problem

158
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:43,240
well people tent to

159
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,980
connect to networks day and trust

160
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,529
or at least they use they think they can
trust

161
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:53,930
home workplaces restaurants

162
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,498
bars cinema malls

163
00:09:57,499 --> 00:10:01,319
and the SSI see SSID is tend to be quite
unique

164
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:05,029
is especially and your workplace and

165
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:08,709
and and and and homies is very
complicated to

166
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,809
to find 2345 SSI

167
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,920
same societies at least in the same
country

168
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,849
of course we need to tweaking or the
SSID is from

169
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,610
public wifi networks but

170
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,959
generally they are quite quite unique

171
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,859
and what is

172
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,910
when is the magic begins is when

173
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,449
you can correlate information when

174
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:40,300
you note that access point that wireless
network

175
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,689
with that SSID is G located when

176
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:47,819
you have the geolocation the coordinates
when you know

177
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:49,729
that

178
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,420
access point is soul weekend

179
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,660
track our people or at least we can know

180
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,750
what what what are two paths while

181
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,180
what the OT doing where where they
connect

182
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,930
cell and we can of course visualize it

183
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,279
this with Google Maps and Google Street
View but

184
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,120
how can we no

185
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,740
we r Wireless networks

186
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,060
way our located basically they are

187
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,089
yes and of course

188
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:27,149
weekend learn a lot of

189
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:30,610
a person just to analyze

190
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,810
the network C he it connects

191
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,109
K we see a mcdonnell's

192
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,510
free WiFi and wireless networks that
okay

193
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,589
free shops are I'll whatever

194
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:49,010
okay this is just a normal person
average Joe but

195
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:54,010
we attacked someone that pat is
connecting

196
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,699
or currently connecting 20 5

197
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:01,130
100 company internet wifi

198
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,910
or dotted connecting to to a location
that

199
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,730
that we know that is very pricey

200
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,709
okay this could be a very very
interesting target for us

201
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:15,800
a burglar for example but

202
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,870
where okay desist on

203
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,000
examples of 10 my victims

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,149
with us with the permission at

205
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:30,070
talk week we can now with with Google
Maps

206
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,840
where the location

207
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,210
where de where he was connected

208
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:41,090
but where we can gather discovery for
mation

209
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,170
where can we get access

210
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,140
good geolocation to the coordinates

211
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,860
okay their ways and call database
colored window but net

212
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,980
its Open Data and everybody can

213
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,630
can use it it's run by by volunteers for
example

214
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,140
I can use network over here at

215
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,370
death camp and nice n to to this but the
database okay

216
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,180
def and Afghan is using is located

217
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,140
over here with this coordinates but

218
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,100
for my point of view at least in the
Portuguese case

219
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,640
it was not the best approach then we
have

220
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,060
I don't know if you remember on on just
news a couple of years ago

221
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,569
that they found out that the court the
cars of

222
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,930
the Google Street View were collecting
did

223
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,519
the SSID is and the wireless names

224
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,269
and saving it and went with that

225
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,310
saving did geolocation

226
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,430
of them and which was a a guide just

227
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,829
don't don't remember did the name of it
and

228
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,989
it with and until a couple of years

229
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,100
by now and it was

230
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,110
possible 22 axis to

231
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,290
to this kind of of information currently
I believe Google just disabled is

232
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,870
this functionality and they are only
selling

233
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,579
selling it for I don't know intelligence

234
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:20,370
agencies or governments the company's
own

235
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,930
or of course I can use a drone

236
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,949
it will be cool but a little bit
expensive or

237
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:32,719
at least our police can do this

238
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,959
and 10 gather information about
manifestations or

239
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,518
whenever the they want

240
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,329
but my approach was a little bit more

241
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:48,250
different I just I will

242
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,720
create my own map my

243
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,640
on database just to research purposes so

244
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,390
was a everybody can can do this cheap
laptop

245
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,459
Android with iraq Raspberry Pi important
is to have

246
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:06,910
while standard can

247
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,939
receive wireless

248
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,339
wireless connections and open source
application

249
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,600
case metal or and erode and support

250
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,730
demands of G GPS

251
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,240
I had a little bit of problems trying to
configure

252
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,240
I paradigm to to work with GPS

253
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,259
and the two 22 made

254
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,300
some some thirty scripts to to do it

255
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,579
that it works GPS tangle
thirty-year-olds

256
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:40,790
back for your laptop or for whatever

257
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,240
okay and of course and good hiking shoes
or you can do

258
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,569
getting your car and do it

259
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:53,560
into your neighborhood or in your city
and okay saw

260
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,819
this is the most important think

261
00:15:56,819 --> 00:16:00,128
to a target to target

262
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:04,310
operation most important miss to
identify

263
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,810
to create a link between a person a face

264
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,229
and the mac Address sense

265
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,850
we know that kind of mac Address

266
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,560
are corresponding to to a person

267
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,689
okay that is game over we can know

268
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,769
if that person radios of

269
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,389
when 100 meters now we can deploy drones

270
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,860
a llover 2cd all over the streets and we
can now

271
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,740
attacked X person is in this
particularly

272
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,970
case location

273
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,310
and of course Cano did where he use

274
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,758
usually connect and possibly no

275
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,650
he's home address

276
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,760
so at this is normally the passive

277
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,540
way to do it just to

278
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,670
capture and

279
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,990
did information are using this that it
is laptop

280
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,400
Justin in monitor mode just going walk

281
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,289
Ind

282
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,809
in the street in the first approach just
walking in just

283
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,398
and receiving the information of

284
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:22,719
the access points i worth and

285
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,309
saving did the GPS data

286
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:29,399
of it and of course saving it

287
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,809
to into a database and mysqld

288
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:36,139
database backed the same way can be in
use

289
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,879
to again information about your

290
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,100
your smartphone's on our your device and

291
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,570
and we can do in a more aggressive way

292
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,250
we can create able to attack and

293
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,710
I believe a

294
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,820
at least the last which are the people
know see don't know I will

295
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,189
I will explain it so the temptation over
here it's

296
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,500
important over here is to control

297
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,519
the flux the communication channel

298
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:15,409
and creating evil twin attack weekend
weekend controlled

299
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:19,380
communication channel can control the
communication channel weakened snippet

300
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,630
can sniff it we can access more
information about

301
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,110
with this person is social networks
email

302
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,139
any kind of cool identify your

303
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:32,168
and in a more aggressive way we can
inject

304
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:35,630
our own malicious called JavaScript code
we can past

305
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,429
the by the resort applications they are
trying to to die alone

306
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:42,529
and and install and this is completely

307
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,260
invincible stupid

308
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,580
to our target and of course more
tactical exploitation

309
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,710
after we gain access to data device we
can have

310
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,530
access to whatever did information day

311
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,060
day where he have okay

312
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,790
just quick notes evil twin attack as we
keep

313
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,899
we keep Wikipedia this is

314
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,580
steel works especially when you connect

315
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,949
to open wife eyes with with health

316
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,020
any kind of authentication sense

317
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,180
your smartphone sensor device

318
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,960
will automatically automatically connect
to

319
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,710
to to tease open wifi don't check

320
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,170
the just don't know if it is true or not
OK you have

321
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,440
this SSID I will connect if any of this
and malicious

322
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,600
access point or malicious device he will
connected

323
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,969
anyway thinking that access point is

324
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,140
widget budgeted by

325
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,320
it is not ten an attacker can

326
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,010
start controlled

327
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,100
communication flow saw again this is the

328
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,310
aggressive way

329
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,560
to do so you can

330
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,679
create your own server

331
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,730
your own laptop price paid by whatever

332
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,380
DHCP server with a bind for

333
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,930
for DNS weights to

334
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,510
proxy to to start sniffing and

335
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,610
the communications okay erode and to
beef

336
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,799
for for injection

337
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,590
of our mullis's JavaScript and of course

338
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,428
MySQL database to to save all
information

339
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:39,240
of course this can be done by its
laptops and rights or russ berry pies or

340
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,490
whatever that run

341
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,570
Linux or have what I double

342
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,120
K K this can be used by

343
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,729
K widget in legitimate purposes

344
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:57,929
okay can be to to a restaurant or or

345
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:00,980
or shop trying

346
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,400
to see try to shake

347
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,040
your hours of

348
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,860
how many people are are in this shopping
disc and

349
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,209
this kind of hours and of course it can
be used to

350
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,340
to helped did law enforcement's to
identify and follow criminals

351
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,770
and of course can be used to more
sinister

352
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,760
proposes to track not only a single
individual but

353
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,049
to track all all true panel

354
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:34,760
and elation okay

355
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,279
this is

356
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:39,340
the architecture of can be dining

357
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,970
large-scale we have several drones Ind

358
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,739
deployed on the wild just

359
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:50,779
get information about declines

360
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:54,460
this kind of

361
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,660
and of information and can be saved

362
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,900
in a storage server and it will be sent
to another server where

363
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,300
they have to it coordinates server

364
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,290
will scheck did the SSID is

365
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,389
are India the server

366
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,590
with the GPS data then on the

367
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,090
left path weekend we can see

368
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,770
after evil twin attack if it was

369
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,740
well secede we can see what we can do

370
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,800
to we can control to flow channel so can
use my cell strip

371
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,419
to 12 SS to to to force

372
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,960
to past forms secure check secure
channel to plaintext channel

373
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,100
okay man in your proxy we can inject

374
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,340
our malicious

375
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,780
JavaScript or and doing

376
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,780
traffic sniffing soul

377
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,490
this is the metrics that I gather with

378
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:02,630
in in Lisbon so one

379
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,060
1200 115 1500

380
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,770
units the vice Pres our it's a lot

381
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,510
soul there's a lot of people that use

382
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,940
all not always but don't have feeling

383
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,200
don't don't know trust

384
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,150
too much in the its in this device so
Lisbon Airport

385
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,720
traffic jams subway stations malls
tourist stops

386
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,210
okay just it's the lock a lot of
people's

387
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,970
for for just one hour and

388
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,930
from that exactly

389
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,320
was gather wat almost 900

390
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,270
unique devices from that one-quarter

391
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,740
leaks at least one SSID

392
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,340
but the they were a lot mordant

393
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,659
leaks 23 I shake

394
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,770
there were some with 89 10 and

395
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,820
8 percent for a vote for the rule or we
know of at least that

396
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,340
day connected to open

397
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,909
wife ice network so or vulnerable to or
at least

398
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,410
think it'll full able to an attack so

399
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,410
but I can't protect for yourself okay
ternal wall

400
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,630
your WiFi devices when you're not using
it

401
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,530
okay don't say your societies that use

402
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,129
and cool way to do it was possibly
randomized are

403
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,560
your Mac Address so if your adversary
was

404
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,080
trying to create a link

405
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,250
or try to target you he will never know

406
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,580
at least it would be more more more
difficult to

407
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,860
to know that that and mac address that's
always changing

408
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:57,169
it will you saw

409
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,270
this is this this is nothing you

410
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,780
this problem was it a identify its

411
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,309
in between 2000-2005 allotted

412
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:13,240
talk about it how it was a very bad idea

413
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,080
to devices connect the Altima connect

414
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,240
in out away tuned

415
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,790
to wireless networks there was something
similar was made by the company sense

416
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,200
post in London in

417
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,430
2000 13 I believe they the creator

418
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,320
K very who Framework about this i think
is

419
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,649
loopy framework go negotiated check it
out

420
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,550
and currently the litter Nick from to
find foundation is creating

421
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,370
a database with all the devices the
modals

422
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,120
and mortars all and companies that

423
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,590
produced this this kind of device that
are vulnerable

424
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:58,600
to this problem so

425
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,800
in the future as I say I will

426
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,610
truly interesting in

427
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,250
study more protocols that can using use

428
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,340
to identify

429
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,780
or at least can booty your privacy any

430
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,510
in jeopardy can people to wifi GCN GPS

431
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,680
and FC or if idea and

432
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,300
the funny part is all these protocols

433
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,110
Irene our smartphones so

434
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:36,060
if you turn off what your wifi

435
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,639
probably one of other particles will

436
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,780
will be good enough to current

437
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,010
track you so I

438
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:49,040
currently have little teamo over here

439
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,070
about my just

440
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,950
three

441
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,219
non just

442
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:02,289
known okay with

443
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,690
with the data that I can access for

444
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,059
for the study and just

445
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:14,190
okay we'll know blasted the first

446
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,399
art like addresses of the devices and on
the right parts

447
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,849
are GPS data so we know

448
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,049
this mac Address where

449
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:28,049
accessing some point of their life

450
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:32,879
to were in this access points

451
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:37,339
GPS so am

452
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:43,428
keys everything just

453
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:48,839
to if you have

454
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:52,079
any questions you can contact me to in
to tease

455
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,940
email so now thank you very much

456
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,389
guess

457
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:02,579
question i kno dat

458
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:05,918
the wireless devices sand the up

459
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,459
as society's in plain text just in the
probe requests

460
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:13,129
when they connect to certain when they
try to connect

461
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:16,769
first but after day are connected 30
access point that don't sound

462
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:20,059
probe request anymore is that right okay
so

463
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,908
I guess that when you collected this
data use and

464
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:28,190
fate the of packets and and set up
something like

465
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,429
air I know that there is a method with
area a replay and GE

466
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:35,820
from the aircraft Angie seats to you up

467
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,208
configure it to responds you all the
program quest

468
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:44,759
and you can actually see the lists of
the societies on all the devices around

469
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,929
you provided the fact that before

470
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:50,509
you send a pic the of pocket or for
everyone to disconnect

471
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:54,099
identify I didn't say any did

472
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,529
packets I was just in monitor mode just
a passive

473
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:01,909
I didn't you just use their adopted in
tunis anything no no no no no no

474
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,549
ok as because that

475
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:07,700
will be against the law and okay K

476
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:14,700
yeah I can confirm that as I D get
broadcast

477
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,009
sort percy to that completely passively
to Android

478
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:25,460
this like out a scanning feature which
was in the early versions

479
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,009
so which was pretty easy 2-0 now you
need to get in

480
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:32,119
some sort of in haines mood to

481
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,009
dis cost like Google network detection

482
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:40,989
something that is exactly and this
features for some time India already

483
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:43,999
and basically even if wifi is of

484
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:48,210
you stop you continue broadcasting US's
ID's and Google's XD

485
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,419
and collecting there while a slander and
looks like you're

486
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:56,859
mobile is violence switch off but it's
not exactly inside in it

487
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:01,799
on by default there is a bill that many
went well what question

488
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,299
to do you know if you are airplane mode
that

489
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:08,789
that that feature it's currently enabled

490
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:11,970
