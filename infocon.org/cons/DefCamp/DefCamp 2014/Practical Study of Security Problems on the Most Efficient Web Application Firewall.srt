and I will give a their words to our
speaker from safe tech yes johnny come

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,850
so less

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,500

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,109
and today I'm going to present you
research paper

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:22,380
research ship project from University
point they can come from Chris

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,580
a.m. the research was made in the first
year

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,409
no I'm the second year the in this
research also was made in collaboration

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,580
safe take

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,099
a.m. pure the bony I'm a security
engineer for safe they can ovation

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,730
are so I used to participate in by 12
programs and responsible disclosure

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,540
programs

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,420
like the those from the presentation
slide

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,640
today when I he repeated the this
president presentation nine-year

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,219
realized that I didn't include VMware
this month the can I be among his

16
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,920
slide because I year have them

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,289
to that in the for today are you

18
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,879
i willllll I first by Willem owners

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,380
the I will speak about the subject of
the security project by you

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,399
ice least I you to search so

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,030
the subject was forty where which is a
security products from fourteen it

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,860
company

23
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,430
this is a web application security it is
a web application firewall

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,890
a.m. protect other web applications a

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,350
after introduction I will speak about
security problems

26
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,990
I found on the administrative console
because these forty web

27
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,899
is administrated for with publication
and

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,420
how I bypassed I will speak about how I
i buy how to bypass the security

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,960
protection of the final

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,579
then conclusion and of course the
questions introduction

31
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,298
42 percent is a security problem from

32
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,000
from fourteen it is a web application
final 'em

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,740
furs the request will you'll any

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,869
herb first the question the will go from
the user

35
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,509
well and until we'll go to the web
application

36
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,899
should the past from that proxy final

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,920
that looks far is the forty webbing our
case

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,720
and the the request them is OK nothing
malicious was phone

39
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,620
on that request nan the sequestered be
rejected back to the user with the

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,430
message that

41
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,530
that the quest is not OK word that the
request to go to the web publication

42
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,490
and the response from the pit barbecue
shimon will be back to the user

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,000
security problems on the NSE that if
console under 40 web

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,500
iPhone the first I'll start with the
deflected cross site scripting

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,920
is like that and the image another
problem was

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,880
the storied one news web application for
all has a security

47
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,450
web application scanner and

48
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,768
them you just run the security scanner
you scan the web application

49
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,830
and the phone that them if that with
publication response

50
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,860
with the malicious payload of course is
keeping the administrator of the

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,890
forty where we see that malicious
payload in the

52
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,298
report at the end of the scam course and

53
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:20,660
that too information will execute in the
browser administration browser

54
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,600
and it is barely okay another problem I
fung

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,760
was a restrictive file upload to
understand what is the outright to

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,950
to make the just I own try to explain
generally

57
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,238
what happened so we have worm

58
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,820
well web applications that use PHP

59
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,900
and the we're happy that we have a

60
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,130
file upload form and we are below the
shelter

61
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,010
file indications that bhp the

62
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,380
Weaver Picatinny will not the verified
extension

63
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,720
if his PhD or other extension and will
place the final in the

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,170
website with of course we can mark says
the fire from the internet because he is

65
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,690
under

66
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,630
website good and that

67
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,290
how them

68
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,859
and forty WebWorks that times the
FileUpload so

69
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,199
there is not in PHP interpreter but the
you can

70
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,310
a blow to the binary files and you can
choose the directory where your

71
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,949
you into places a blow that you're a
blow the fire

72
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:29,530
a.m. I should buy a year have to buy I
had to bypass some restriction

73
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,270
but I cannot show you right now of
course these

74
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,859
all these lemme problem security
problems are sold

75
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,460
from through September this year I
reported in July

76
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,229
the new find real possibility of course
I know you're cynical

77
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,320
not mistake that will not use the world
as possible

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,479
test just for the presentation if you
find out the password

79
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,969
in plain text you can authenticating the
administrative console Wii

80
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,580
administrative right other

81
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,820
problems were even this forty web use as
authentication

82
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,550
LDAP server who came before the possible
without to the user name and password

83
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,729
another problem there he's a

84
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,919
with the request of a new license so the

85
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,030
forty where lemme who

86
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,820
to offer protection for other web
applications you need to a blow the

87
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,400
license valid license

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,960
and with the that very license you can
offer protection to other web

89
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,659
applications

90
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,970
the problem here and there is a big
problem

91
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,260
a is that you can upload on invalid
license and you

92
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,729
invalidate the existing one week to just
one request and is not verified these

93
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:43,060
the

94
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,280
request was a outraged and authenticated
so

95
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,710
is badly too okay I have all these

96
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,460
security problems what can I do with all
this problems

97
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,729
so them to explain how will I found IP
addresses

98
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:03,050
first let me show you how a response
from though

99
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,490
these 140 Weber is and the the response
body

100
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,639
them I you find out that the in the
response have their life

101
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,819
it was a permit that name server: and
it's very was a7x

102
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,060
and leases was a application from that
because these

103
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,529
this text you couldn't I put in phone
thing

104
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:26,879
it is not possible to be another weaver
it is possible but the

105
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,909
I set on stone us on the

106
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:34,800
should on Salon & it he's not
specifically for forty web

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,849
is text and I

108
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,099
'em I said that these opposition from
their pin

109
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:44,310
after searching on saddam I realize that

110
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,979
them there are more than 200 a piece
from

111
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:52,628
the for where these 40 web using stock
and I cannot thank them

112
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:56,560
short list of the administrative console
iPhone

113
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,740
public and private entities

114
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,569
like good government by one researching
a book center from

115
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:09,639
China and the race continues with other
two hundred

116
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,949
eyepiece a.m.

117
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,449
so these all on the obligation

118
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,469
the administrative console of the forty
web

119
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:23,089
now a heart bypass the security
protection of

120
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:27,969
this final this federal offer to other
web application security protection

121
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:31,439
so I fun ways to bypass the security
protection and

122
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,419
my Europe request he directed into the
with publication

123
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,930
and the without being blocked by the
final

124
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,210
so I found the waist to

125
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,589
by positively injection protection a.m.

126
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:48,879
first and second payload was

127
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,639
the are available for any database and

128
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,849
the other three are available only for
my skier first and second i think is

129
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:03,210
the and no school and I didn't expect to
find such

130
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,789
problem being in the produce security
protection

131
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:09,969
by the other freemen I found the

132
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:13,210
that you can use if close and inside of
the flows you can

133
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,370
you can run and benchmark function and
discreet the delay on the server and

134
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,479
that's how you can

135
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,719
no than on information is true or not

136
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,600
on the database so I can extract
information from the database

137
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,930
conclusions

138
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,450
'em a so

139
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,700
iPhone how to to find IP addresses where

140
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,900
these web application firewall is
installed you can

141
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,560
retrieve the consideration for you to
read users and

142
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,939
there has prospered then can perform a
brute force attack on

143
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,890
the house buser tenu this before succeed
then

144
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,189
you just can authenticating the web
application

145
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,440
console other problem cities

146
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,120
in you can park but possible to buy
presents for protection

147
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,860
I mentioned earlier key

148
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,129
questions you have any questions

149
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:22,129
only I heard man

150
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,930
so how responsive was the company to you
when you first brought the spines

151
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,270
well and what was their demeanor

152
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,420
would you say to the positive feedback
from them so

153
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,219
I made a research paper I sent it to
them the

154
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,790
respond immediately they said I they
need some time to

155
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,310
at interval of time to resolve these all
these problems

156
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,930
I gave them this interval of time and

157
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,579
I told them I that I want could the

158
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,110
C VA from niece and they didn't respond
to my emails when I asked them for

159
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,340
CBA but the when I ask something else
they

160
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,830
respond to my emails its okay but but
this request is

161
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:23,830
they'd they are not agree to it up what
do you do it

162
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,330
the Administration Console is in the
private network

163
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,980
you cannot access it of course so this
is

164
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,080
the public interface console
administrators should hide from the

165
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,670
internets

166
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,729
so is not a problem from 14 at

167
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,130
I should mention that is a problem from

168
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,060
the that the and it is that

169
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,579
mystery that web where forty when okay
so if you don't have

170
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,690
access to the Administration Console you
you can exploit

171
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,680
any finding thank you any nobody's

172
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,880
