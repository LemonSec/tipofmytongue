1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
time for our next presentation before

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,640
the panel before lunch

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,200
so let's get started with a topic that's

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,160
very

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,040
uh

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,040
very very sexy right now in cyber

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,440
security which is bug body hunting

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,360
there's a lot of interest and a lot of

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,199
hype around it but

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,880
probably many of you don't know where to

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,480
start if you're interested in that kind

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,600
of thing so to make sure that you have a

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,359
starting point and that you know how to

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,439
kind of channel your energy and figure

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,519
out you know what the thing is all about

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,320
we have luciani tesla senior i.t

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,320
security specialist from bits and month

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,680
one of the

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,120
creators of the challenges in the

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,960
hacking village and obviously one of the

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
long time partners and key contributors

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
to deaf camp since forever basically

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,480
welcome great to have you here let's

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,640
dive right into it

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,120
so um

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,079
today i'm going to present um a

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,879
sort of race type or also known as a

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,000
kill chain

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
for

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,159
bug bounty hunting vulnerability

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
detection which might help any beginner

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,159
to start this path

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,960
so

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,479
first of all um as andra already told

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,320
them where am i uh i'm a red team uh

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,560
tech leader center i got recently

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,119
promoted that's why it's not updated on

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:23,920
the

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
on the dev camp uh website uh i'm also a

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
ctf organizer and uh challenge author

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
for devcomp dctf uh the new king of the

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,759
camp uh

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,159
challenge within the hacking village go

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,079
ahead and check that out

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,520
um i'm also organizer and

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,759
challenge author at unbreakable romania

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,840
in the past i was

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,399
involved in the european cyber security

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,320
challenge and the

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,799
romanian cyber security challenge

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,560
uh and also

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,360
because this talk is about bug bounty

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,799
hunting i am um a bug bounty hunter at

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,439
warcraft hecarim integrity and

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,878
lately at stealing

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
so while

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,879
i do bug banding

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,920
so as i write it there infinite

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,000
never-ending learning tree path with

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120
endless possibilities so

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000
it's

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,239
an ongoing process

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
to learn new things and to interact with

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,560
technologies from a

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
security perspective

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,519
um

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,920
another reason is that i want to help

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
others and other companies to be more

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,720
secure and why not appreciate

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,360
appreciations um

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,640
because

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,560
when you are doing bug bounty hunting

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
with all the competition that i

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
described later on um you get more

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,680
appreciated than a regular uh security

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,239
engineer penetration testing or

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,280
anything any uh insert any job title in

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
there so

79
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,360
i'm also a competition addicted

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,000
mainly because this field of the bug

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
want is

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,959
mainly competitive

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,000
um

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
for example

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,080
this is a real time uh 17 i mean it's

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
late uh

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,640
for reporting a bounty means you get a

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
duplicate and you don't earn no

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,760
financial gain you do not gain any

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,519
financial gain

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,720
and

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,879
most of the vulnerabilities are not even

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,000
in in the scope so if you do not have a

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
proof of concept of workable like a

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,560
python script that shows that specific

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
gravity

97
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,519
um

98
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,319
and uh of course you are at the same

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,560
time against and uh

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,760
uh

101
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,519
uh within

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,480
the

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,360
sort of global community or team in

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
order to to help others protect their

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
their

106
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
uh assets

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,319
okay um it's also personal stress and

108
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,640
boredom coping mechanisms whenever i get

109
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,319
uh stressed out or bored i go ahead and

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,400
do vagranting that's why before this

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
presentation i did somewhat warranty

112
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,519
um

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,238
at some point in my life i switched from

114
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,759
online gaming to by bounty just for the

115
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,280
the fun of it

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,320
and uh the last reason in my opinion

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,800
it's uh the money that it brings uh

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,240
and

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
let's go ahead uh

120
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,840
why uh

121
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,720
watch

122
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,800
what triggered me to to become about

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,960
monty so i have here a comparation

124
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,040
between a day-by-day regular job and a

125
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,759
bug bounty program let's say

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,800
um

127
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
mainly at the regular job i do not

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,520
choose my clients the company chooses uh

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,960
choose those for me um at bug bounty

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
programs i choose i get to choose my own

131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,800
clients i i get to choose on what

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
program i want to work on what

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,360
technology i want to to get involved in

134
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,600
even if i'm not skilled it's a good

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,440
opportunity to to get that skill uh by

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,400
doing uh actual penetration testing on

137
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,280
that on susquehad review why not

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,600
um

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,400
another reason it's uh that at a regular

140
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,039
job you cannot work for multiple

141
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,600
companies at once and switch them

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,080
tomorrow because their clients you have

143
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,240
to

144
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,039
finish their their project in order to

145
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,039
move to another one

146
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,520
while in buck bounty most of the fortune

147
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,759
500 companies are there

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,440
um

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,960
and you do not have to go to a hiring

150
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
process or interact with any department

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
we have a program you can read it and

152
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,520
you can start

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,440
hacking or detecting actual

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,880
vulnerabilities and reporting them in

155
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,639
order to be fixed

156
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,240
um

157
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,280
a disadvantage uh

158
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,800
more teamwork limited competition at a

159
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,280
regular job you have more opportunities

160
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,080
to

161
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
to learn basic stuff

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,560
while at the back bounty programs here

163
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
you get just your yourself

164
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
and

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
see if you are up to to

166
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,560
to that task uh another uh

167
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,319
benefit of uh

168
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,880
bug bug hunting it's

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,080
of

170
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,960
the regular job is a fixed income while

171
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,240
i consider bug bounty hunting as an

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
incentive to on top of my fixed income

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,840
so i i do not um

174
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
see myself moving towards a full

175
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
uh bug monty

176
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,759
let's say career

177
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,039
until now but

178
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,720
i get to bring

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
let's say tested and

180
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,120
validated vulnerabilities discovered in

181
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,520
back boundary programs within a day by

182
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,639
day job

183
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,199
so because i talking uh

184
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
why do consider as an incentive

185
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,240
and not as a

186
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
fixed income uh what are my stats

187
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,520
so my all-time accuracy on let's take

188
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
those two platforms where i'm more

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,759
active than than the others

190
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,199
um

191
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,000
my all-time accuracy it's over 90

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,199
percent and this is this year uh

193
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,080
accuracy is over 95 percent

194
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,199
um

195
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,759
unfortunately one out of uh

196
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
6.3 vulnerabilities that i i reported

197
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
are actually duplicates

198
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,080
uh that means that other researchers

199
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,800
found them in the first place so i know

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
i'm i'm doing a good job by by dictating

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,280
those but there were already uh

202
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,240
reported and i i don't get

203
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,199
gain any financial gain but i do get

204
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,479
points to get access to private programs

205
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,599
and uh that's where the main activity

206
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,199
and uh

207
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,080
the main income comes from

208
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,520
um over the past five years

209
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,479
five years i had discovered or actually

210
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,039
reported we'll see that later uh about

211
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,360
110 uh vulnerabilities

212
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,400
on average even if i took an ear off at

213
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,520
some point

214
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,560
um

215
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
i'm about

216
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,080
two bucks per month

217
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
uh and i only spend only eight to ten

218
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,958
hours a week

219
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,958
so let's see how i'm how i'm doing that

220
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,200
so my recycling's short

221
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,880
and first rule of any recycle either in

222
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,360
cooking or either in trying to make a

223
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,839
checklist or either in doing whatever

224
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,080
you want in this world there is no

225
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,839
perfectly type

226
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,080
and you have to add at some point your

227
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
favorite ingredients in order to make it

228
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,880
work

229
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,240
um

230
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
this presentation intends to present an

231
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,040
automation that any beginner can do that

232
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,279
tomorrow in order to get started with

233
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,959
bug bounty hunting

234
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,880
and maybe gain some financial gain

235
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,200
or

236
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,839
help him

237
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,640
discover duplicates vulnerabilities

238
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,360
that will allow him to gain access to

239
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,800
let's say 10 or 20 private programs

240
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
um

241
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,640
in general my my

242
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,519
my bug bounty hunting experience with

243
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,000
any program starts with the scope and

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
defining an approach

245
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,480
mainly my approach is already defined i

246
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
i

247
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,120
i look for web application

248
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,279
targets you see why

249
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,920
and then i will

250
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,680
draft that approach execute

251
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,240
let's say testing methodology

252
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
filter the results and report only those

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,279
that count

254
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
and of course at the end you have to

255
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,079
improve and reach your tooling and then

256
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,200
maintain a schedule in order to to be

257
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
successful

258
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
and maintaining its let's say the the

259
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,240
hardest part of of the one

260
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,760
so

261
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,680
define us defining scope uh it starts by

262
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,320
looking at one of those uh

263
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,640
bug bounty platforms or

264
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,760
any others like synagogue or indignity

265
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,600
um

266
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,560
but i took as example uh

267
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,360
one from hacker one which you can start

268
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,760
tomorrow you can register there you can

269
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,800
go to the identity validation process

270
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,120
and then you can start hunting your own

271
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,160
box

272
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,839
and if you

273
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,480
can already see there there

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,399
this example is about paypal which is a

275
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,839
public program

276
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,680
um uh and down in the right corner you

277
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,920
can see the payment statistics over the

278
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
years people as a company paid over six

279
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,320
million

280
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
six and a half million

281
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,000
million dollars in boundary rewards to

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,920
security researchers that found

283
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,959
vulnerabilities or even zero days in in

284
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,760
their

285
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,480
application or assets

286
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,320
okay

287
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,120
so um

288
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,560
my research about defining a scope um

289
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,079
mainly i like web application i do focus

290
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,920
on that uh

291
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,480
there are let's say less than 100

292
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,760
programs

293
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,959
that are interesting to to me or to us

294
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,160
or

295
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,200
depends

296
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
on unknown number of private programs

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,959
because of course they're private uh

298
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,200
let's say i have access to

299
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,320
more

300
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,680
uh in

301
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,959
range of

302
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,240
uh tens to up to a hundreds

303
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,040
um they are about

304
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,560
so from those uh 100 public programs

305
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,880
you have domains and subdomains that are

306
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,959
in scope uh

307
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,000
most of the times are only fixed targets

308
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
like that application or

309
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,600
another one

310
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,240
uh but you also have

311
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,639
programs that contain wildcard domains

312
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,760
as you see the that example it includes

313
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,120
all subdomains of example dot

314
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,720
kld

315
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,639
uh at first look

316
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,920
if you are going to scan today you are

317
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,959
going to

318
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,320
see a about online 1.5 million web

319
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,600
application

320
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
which you can start testing to

321
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
today

322
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,160
um

323
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,079
from which let's say around

324
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,839
600 k 600

325
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
are

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,519
web application after a quick filter for

327
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,160
example i filtered out the tumblr

328
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,279
blogs

329
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,839
and wordpress blogs because you do not

330
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,040
want to test those as an individual

331
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,160
asset

332
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,380
due to the fact that

333
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,720
[Music]

334
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,560
it uses the same code base so you might

335
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,600
want to

336
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,480
to

337
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,360
to skip those and focus on what's

338
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
unique and what's interesting and what

339
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,959
can allow you from

340
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,639
a probability point of view uh to find a

341
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,160
bug

342
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,120
okay so going forward this is a fun fact

343
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,800
if i would really

344
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,760
uh

345
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,480
get myself involved in this black bounty

346
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,120
hunting more than 10 hours a week

347
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,880
let's say for five

348
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,680
days per target

349
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,839
at 600 000

350
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,560
targets it would take me five days

351
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,120
divided that by how many days in a month

352
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,639
divided by

353
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,079
that by how many roughly approximation

354
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,040
actually

355
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,839
of how many months uh

356
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,680
in a year it's about 8 000 years so i

357
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,399
don't have enough time for that one

358
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,720
um

359
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,959
minus the of course the target is the

360
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
same code base or identical targets

361
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,760
uh moving forward um

362
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,040
i would like to point out that

363
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,480
maybe as a student or

364
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,639
beginner in the security field it's a

365
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,199
good approach to start uh with bug

366
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,120
bounty hunting because it gives you

367
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,240
experience

368
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,120
no other company is going to provide you

369
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,600
from tomorrow or today of 600 targets to

370
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,720
play with

371
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,480
or any cyber lab will not be able to to

372
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
provide that in a second

373
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
uh you can start today you can learn

374
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,839
from experts you can look for

375
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,360
presentation uh

376
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,160
by other bug bounty hunters everyone is

377
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,720
willing to share and give you an insight

378
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,760
of what they are doing in this hunting

379
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,920
and how you can get more performance

380
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,199
because at 600 000 targets only on

381
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,600
public uh programs

382
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,399
uh

383
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,920
you really

384
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,600
need to

385
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,480
we really need that help in in fact and

386
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,399
companies need that help and they are

387
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,399
willing to pay thousands

388
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,440
of dollars in order to to get that help

389
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,399
and there is no no time for for as you

390
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,399
will see later on in this presentation

391
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,639
for keeping secrets

392
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,160
so

393
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,240
next um

394
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
defines scope

395
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,759
first of all you have to respect the

396
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,360
rules of the program

397
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,959
you have to

398
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,839
to to read those you have to remember

399
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,160
those you have to take notes in order to

400
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,839
ensure that you are not targeting the

401
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,560
wrong asset or you are not causing any

402
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,079
damage to that

403
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,800
specific program if you go out of scope

404
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,759
it's your mistake and your mistake only

405
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,120
you have to be

406
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,920
in enough informed before you start

407
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,959
doing any sorts of bug bounty hunting

408
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,240
and the bug bounty description is there

409
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,560
for you to read if you do not understand

410
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,240
that well granted description you have

411
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,199
to ask and understand the

412
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,079
uh understand it from from the

413
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,839
the

414
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,279
bounty platform

415
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,040
that

416
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,680
provides that description

417
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,720
so moving on um

418
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,199
mainly today i'm going to explain a

419
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,320
basic

420
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,440
hunting methodology or reside for

421
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,560
using project discovery tools which

422
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,800
are all open source

423
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,240
and

424
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,399
most of this information can be found on

425
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,560
google or by following the right people

426
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,680
on twitter

427
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,160
so it's no secret of what i'm showing

428
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,079
today it's just

429
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,519
shown in a

430
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,040
um let's say easy to follow way to get

431
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,799
you started

432
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,760
so um this is how my scope looks

433
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,160
in general i have for every pro bounty

434
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,799
platform uh python scripts uh python

435
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,959
script that handles uh

436
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,520
all the data from the the

437
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,280
bounty description

438
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,720
and i only allow

439
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,079
in their

440
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,720
programs that i already

441
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
researched into and i am aware of all

442
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,400
their rules if one bounty program does

443
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,280
not fit within that rule i'm going to

444
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,919
skip it or postponed and make a fork of

445
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,480
that script in order to to be sure i'm

446
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,559
targeting the right assets

447
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,799
so in general i have roots

448
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,320
which is a

449
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
let's say uh

450
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
any wild card

451
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,000
domain goes in there targets are fixed

452
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,320
assets like web applications

453
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
and out of scopes of course means out of

454
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,160
scope applications and of course over

455
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,799
the time while doing research i

456
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,440
made a list like a

457
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,160
permanent out of scope

458
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,799
filtering list of keywords that i do not

459
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,280
want to waste my time on it and test

460
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,240
them

461
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
or maybe

462
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,480
i want to postpone them by in order to

463
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,640
take them manually in order to not cause

464
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
damage but still find bugs that i can

465
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
later on report

466
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
so this is how

467
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,400
subdomain search using subfinder looks

468
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
like in one line

469
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,559
uh you go for those wildcard subdomains

470
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,760
and you save them in a file and then you

471
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
concatenate those files and you have a

472
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,360
big scope of 600 targets it could be

473
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,000
improved that's why you have to add your

474
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
ingredients to these prevent

475
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,919
presentations

476
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,320
presentation

477
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,120
and

478
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,280
this is how i filter out

479
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,360
my targets in

480
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,520
long ago bash script

481
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,880
so

482
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,600
i get those subdomains in

483
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
in that txt file

484
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,360
i get the autoscope and i just grab

485
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
them out in order to to get only the

486
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,160
targets that i'm interested within

487
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
uh later on after i have all the

488
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
subdomains i take in consideration

489
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,080
finding ports and for the that i'm using

490
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
uh nabo you can also use nmap it's a

491
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
term of flavor let's say and uh the main

492
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,080
idea is to find all web application

493
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,760
runnings on all ports on all sub-domains

494
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,280
for example you can have a subdomain

495
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,600
like hackerone.com which has four web

496
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,640
ports uh as as shown in uh in the

497
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,120
example over there from a screenshot of

498
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,799
the project actually

499
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,360
and you want to

500
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,480
to

501
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,559
to scan those

502
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,559
to include those in your scans

503
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,280
uh moving forward i'm going to to

504
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,039
identify them if they are hashtag ps or

505
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,799
http targets in order to make sure i'm

506
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,200
communicating over the same protocol

507
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,679
and this information is

508
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,640
uh

509
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,880
not so new it's been

510
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
four years in within the community if

511
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
you are going to search for tweets

512
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,919
showing that it will be

513
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,640
let's say uh starting from two years or

514
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,080
three years ago

515
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,559
uh everyone was doing that in a form or

516
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,039
another using one tool or another it's a

517
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,000
term of flavor and

518
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,280
uh if you are if you did that until now

519
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,640
well

520
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,080
that's awesome

521
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,120
uh and great you did a good job but at

522
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,720
the same time

523
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,799
it is wrong and incomplete

524
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,280
and why i'm taking uh why i'm saying

525
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,679
that is because it takes time to be at

526
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,000
the right right place at the rate right

527
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,159
time to find that one issue that will

528
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:00,880
get

529
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,919
paid within a bug bounty program

530
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,880
so uh back to my

531
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
reset um

532
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,880
this is how i run httpx in order to

533
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
to find to

534
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,840
determine if um

535
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,640
i'm

536
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
looking for http targets or https

537
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,960
targets and um if you take a closer look

538
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,159
i'm using axiom scan

539
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,960
so you probably wonder what's axiom is

540
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,919
because i never thought that before

541
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,400
so it's not the

542
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,520
axiom spaceship from wally

543
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,240
but it helps you to break walls

544
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,320
efficiently and why i'm seeing that

545
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,280
you'll see later on this presentation

546
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
so uh if you want to search that on on

547
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
google you'll have to say axiom github

548
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,480
and you'll only get 87 reasons

549
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
that's how popular this project is but

550
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,840
it helps a lot

551
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,919
um you will

552
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,000
know it if you are following the the

553
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,080
right people on on the twitter community

554
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,760
or back bounty twitter community we are

555
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,039
going to to see that further on uh

556
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,280
but what's axiom now

557
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,799
um

558
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,080
pretty much

559
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,880
i want to say about axiom is like a

560
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,080
legal

561
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,440
uh vps supported botnet that you can set

562
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,720
up today

563
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,280
at your own expenses without taking any

564
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,760
system so legally

565
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,480
and

566
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,880
it helps you

567
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
use multiple

568
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,480
systems in order to to scan

569
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,679
a target from different ip addresses

570
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,600
how it works pretty much you select a

571
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,799
provider

572
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,120
in that example i have digital ocean you

573
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,080
create 100 droplets or virtual private

574
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,919
servers

575
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,400
instead of digitalocean can be any

576
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,320
hosting company you want and that which

577
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,039
provides vps action provides you a

578
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,520
framework you can set up and expand that

579
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,960
framework

580
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,679
with any distributor you want

581
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,480
um you have at that point when you have

582
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,400
those 100

583
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,159
servers at that point you have 100 ips

584
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,520
and

585
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,520
pay per our usage so if your scan takes

586
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,559
five hours you only pay for five hours

587
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,559
because that's the

588
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,159
cloud that we are living in uh and

589
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,880
um it outputs all the results in a

590
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,520
single place mainly either on your host

591
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,559
or on a bridged uh server that you used

592
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,679
in order to launch the those cons

593
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,880
so what are the axiom benefits in this

594
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,760
bug bounty board so let's say for about

595
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,559
a dollar that's an exact approximation

596
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,880
over the last year expenses that i got

597
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,080
um

598
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,039
you pro to trash a few security

599
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,840
limitations like the rate limits country

600
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,159
restricted assets some web application

601
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,559
firewalls that are looking for content

602
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,039
or multiple hits in order to trick that

603
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,039
application fire and block you from that

604
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,880
specific target

605
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,840
some

606
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,080
poor scanning limitations and so on so

607
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,039
forth

608
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,840
um also note that you should not use

609
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,799
that for illegal activities as the vps

610
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,840
provider will provide logs in case of

611
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,760
incidents and

612
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,559
they are willing to to do so because you

613
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,200
are using their infrastructure mainly i

614
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,320
make like two terabytes three terabytes

615
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,279
of the data traffic week

616
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,400
so they will be more easy to to skip me

617
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,159
for

618
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,240
let's say five dollars

619
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,360
a week

620
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,320
um

621
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,159
instead of uh

622
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,320
providing those services as a low cost

623
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
and using their they their traffic and

624
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,480
so on so forth so they have all interest

625
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,400
to to get uh read if you are doing

626
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,919
illegal activities

627
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,159
of course they are all interest to keep

628
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,320
you if you are doing legal activities

629
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
and you are following the bug bounty

630
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,520
programs and their rules

631
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
moving forward

632
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,559
um and back to our recycle uh

633
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,000
this is how i launched on

634
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,960
um

635
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,919
those

636
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,799
uh httpx uh scans

637
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,720
um but first we we have to to

638
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,760
request 100 servers let's say from from

639
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,440
from digital auction

640
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,400
and this is an example uh

641
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,400
with commands online two you set up in a

642
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,159
minute in minutes

643
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,159
100 servers in

644
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,799
regions across the the world for example

645
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,400
digital option supports 11 or 12 if they

646
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
open the new data center um

647
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,159
and

648
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,840
then you have to launch that scan

649
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,840
and then you sort out all

650
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,000
unique uh targets and you save it in a

651
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
file now you have a

652
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,840
pretty long

653
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
file that you can

654
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,919
uh

655
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,000
of web application that you can start

656
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,279
researching and looking for bugs into

657
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,440
um

658
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
what the heck is nuclear uh

659
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
pretty much

660
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,760
it's a scanning

661
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,640
tool

662
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,640
it takes templates in yaml formal in

663
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,279
yaml format um

664
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,440
for example here we have a

665
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,279
yamaha template for

666
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,960
looking for

667
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,400
uh amazon

668
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,520
tokens

669
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,440
and uh is doing or only a get request

670
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,919
on slash uh and it's

671
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,120
doing a regex in order to to find that

672
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,440
secretary this is um

673
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,360
let's say pretty hard to

674
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
to find the

675
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,279
uh

676
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,960
rule but even that one which is the

677
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,000
example on github on their page i

678
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,520
managed to find it twice in those 600

679
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,080
targets over the

680
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,799
previous month

681
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,159
now moving forward

682
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,520
this is how you

683
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
run this

684
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,640
this scan

685
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,520
it's

686
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,399
only

687
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,840
you you have a list of web targets as

688
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,600
our uh

689
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,880
output was shown before and you run it

690
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,080
on it and you find uh

691
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,880
affected the assets on the

692
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,200
on within the bounty limitation let's go

693
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,799
okay so how powerful is this tool

694
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,679
so

695
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,440
almost any cv present for the past one

696
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,640
year or two years on hacker one comes

697
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,880
from nuclear scans how do i know that is

698
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,200
that they are providing the same request

699
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,760
as one within the templates

700
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,320
so every cookie and header it's the same

701
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,399
as one from the

702
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,120
from the nuclei templates or the public

703
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,679
repository of those

704
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,200
it's open source it has 277

705
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,679
contributors it covers

706
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,120
over 800 cves

707
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,080
from which 300

708
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,640
and other vulnerabilities and from which

709
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,360
300 are rated as critical if you find

710
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,399
those

711
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,799
most of the time is going if it's not

712
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,559
going to be a false positive because hey

713
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,919
this is scanning

714
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,799
uh is going to be rewarded

715
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,600
then

716
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,360
you have

717
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,840
other vulnerabilities that you have to

718
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,520
manually look into and understand and

719
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,240
provide a proof of concept

720
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,720
in order

721
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,039
to understand

722
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
or availability impact and most of the

723
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,279
time availability in bug bounty

724
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,039
it's ignored

725
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,399
because they consider as non-rewardable

726
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,960
vulnerabilities so

727
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,200
that's it you can use that in order to

728
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,960
understand and take

729
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,039
uh all the the action in order to

730
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,520
improve your reporting success

731
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,200
um

732
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,399
five it has a five minutes tutorial that

733
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,480
allows you to write

734
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,279
any rule for any vulnerability on a web

735
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,640
application

736
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,039
because it's a tool designed for web

737
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,440
application of course it has some rules

738
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,240
uh

739
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,840
for protocols that

740
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,480
provide a

741
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,120
panel response uh like uh ssh uh but

742
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,200
that's uh version graphing if you are

743
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,799
going to report that to a bar bounty

744
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,720
program is going to be

745
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,039
ignored because it does not have a

746
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,640
functional proof of concept in order to

747
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,240
gain a result

748
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,520
so

749
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,279
what i recommend to you of course is to

750
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,039
keep a private uh repository of rules

751
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,480
that no one else has or are not aware at

752
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,919
that time and after doing the bounty

753
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,480
research and over let's say a month or

754
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,360
two let's you should dedicate those and

755
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,080
share it with the community to a better

756
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,039
safer and secure environment within the

757
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,399
the world

758
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,360
okay so here are some um

759
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,480
it's uh

760
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,240
actually on one

761
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,200
faster okay uh here's an example of how

762
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,799
do you run

763
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,159
a scan

764
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,360
with this

765
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,919
um it's a one-liner i had to split it

766
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,360
onto

767
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,039
you you provide the target use the

768
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,279
module you launch the scan you get the

769
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,399
results

770
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,039
and of course here i'm looking for uh

771
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,679
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

772
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,720
uh

773
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,120
the recycling one slide is that i'm

774
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,000
sending

775
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,159
files to axiom

776
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,120
i'm using their module to

777
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,399
to get the

778
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,320
final results

779
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,720
and you will say yes but this is kind of

780
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,159
how good it is

781
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,960
so i run some experiments on a while

782
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,159
through approach

783
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,159
from

784
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,519
this month and i managed to get to the

785
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,080
two duplicates another 30

786
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,000
there are there four months you'll see

787
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
later uh

788
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,399
those

789
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,399
results will give you access to private

790
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,440
programs i got three informational bugs

791
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,919
uh two trigger bugs that are still

792
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,840
pending review there are reflected

793
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,480
cross-site scriptings and

794
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,440
one bounty so just by doing this con you

795
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,760
can do it today or tomorrow

796
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,320
you might hit one or two vulnerabilities

797
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
or hit 30 vulnerabilities which give you

798
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,399
access to private programs which allows

799
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,000
you to find more vulnerabilities and

800
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,360
more money

801
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,240
so

802
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,360
the rule is try harder find out

803
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,080
why is working for me and what

804
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
it should work for you and what you are

805
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,880
adding on that in order to start hunting

806
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,640
today

807
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,120
uh it's not if enough

808
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,760
reporting it has to be clean it has to

809
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,919
be to provide the proof of concept it

810
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,720
has to provide information most of the

811
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,679
time i search for reports on hacker one

812
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,240
because most of the time they are public

813
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,279
uh

814
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,919
when is output from a scanning tool um

815
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,159
and sometimes i hypothetically ask a

816
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,360
friend

817
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,240
like

818
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,760
you see there

819
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,080
uh helping me out if

820
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,360
the

821
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,840
ssrif

822
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,760
vulnerability that i managed to to get

823
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,120
the bounty on

824
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,559
and

825
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,960
moving forward it's not enough

826
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
uh

827
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,000
reporting you have to to keep track of

828
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,200
all your information uh i keep track of

829
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,679
all my purposes projects i keep track of

830
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,360
templates for reporting government in

831
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,640
order to have

832
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,080
uh

833
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,799
let's say a cool looking report and

834
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,120
understandable and which answer to all

835
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,840
questions and that helped me out to to

836
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,600
score this uh

837
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,799
this uh

838
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,720
bounty so you can see 25 minutes ago

839
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,799
at some point in time i reported

840
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,519
vulnerability and 14 and a few minutes

841
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,399
later like 10 or 15 like that i got the

842
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,039
bump that's how fast it could it would

843
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,679
from days you switch to minutes that's

844
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,600
that's your own scope when you are you

845
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,240
want to do a proper reporting

846
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,760
um

847
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,240
it's not enough tooling there are 60

848
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,120
other model modules within axiom you can

849
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,720
integrate and use

850
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,640
there are 50 other

851
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,440
integrals and potentially 100 other

852
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,519
tools and

853
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,840
things you can add on top of this this

854
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,000
site to help you find bugs they are

855
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,480
there i gave two examples go ahead and

856
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,599
check them out

857
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,159
and keep an eye on the twitter feed for

858
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,599
babanti tips and new cds

859
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,839
and of course you should get into

860
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,560
programming and automation

861
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,520
by doing so uh of course there

862
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,560
there are

863
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,960
uh other tools like

864
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,560
recon for the win

865
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,480
which provides you

866
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,119
some of those tools as i described in

867
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,560
this recycler but it lim it's limited

868
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,879
it's very

869
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,639
let's say fixed if you want to add

870
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,719
something new on top you will struggle

871
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,480
with the framework itself instead of

872
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,000
using that time in order to find

873
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,918
vulnerabilities

874
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,598
um do not stop here

875
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,160
all i provided has either bugs or

876
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,640
deficiencies nothing is out of the box

877
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,440
you have to research into it it is up to

878
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,680
you to fix them and test and enrich them

879
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
in order to get successful in this field

880
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,359
uh you have to try harder

881
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,680
and um

882
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,800
