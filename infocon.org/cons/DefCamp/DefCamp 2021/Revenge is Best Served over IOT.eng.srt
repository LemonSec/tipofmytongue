5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,920

hanging out around the event uh so now

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
it is time for one of those stories that

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,680

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
last time that i saw our next guest uh

talk at death camp because uh as i'll

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,759
explain in the presentation uh the more

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,720
this uh issue and this type of issue uh

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,440
goes public the safer security

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,040
researchers like us actually are

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,200
so

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,920
if you don't know me in person i'm a bit

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,000
snarky as well i don't know what a

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,879
another good translation is for that uh

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
but um i i don't like bullies so this

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,480
talk came out of that revenge is best

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,640
served over iot

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,440
and

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,519
uh as it was explained i'm with the

63
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,160
middle east institute and also had my

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,480
own company i also have a us military

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,040
background and i deal a lot in critical

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,879
infrastructure security

67
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,920
um

68
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,239
we all love our modern world with our

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,879
electricity and running water and things

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,480
like that but

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,920
it's all digitized and where there's

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,000
digital there are

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
good hackers like us

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,879
bad hackers like the iranians

75
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,680
so

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,280
um i'll give you a little intro um

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,720
most of you if not all of you have

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
probably heard of something called

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
stuxnut

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,239
uh the iranian government is uh quite

81
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,120
interesting because um there's a lot of

82
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,640
power plays that are going on in the

83
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
middle east and northern africa because

84
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,480
of iran uh whether it be uh various

85
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,640
different types of funding uh terrorist

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,440
organizations to hacking and right now

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
they are under a lot of pressure to try

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,239
to get a nuclear agreement uh signed

89
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,640
again which was unsigned by the previous

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,518
uh government

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,959
president of the united states and one

92
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,720
of the things that they've been trying

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,599
to do for a long time is to disrupt

94
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,040
things that are going on in the middle

95
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
east so recently uh many of the middle

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
eastern and northern african governments

97
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
actually signed something called the

98
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,360
abraham peace accord and uh with the

99
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
middle east about a year ago

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
at our institute we actually drafted the

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,159
world's first cyber peace accord called

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,720
the abraham cyber peace accord and this

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
is because of a lot of the iranian

104
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,519
actions and a lot of the cyber attacks

105
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,600
that have come out of there

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,639
so

107
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,798
i'll take you on a little journey uh

108
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,199
back in 2016

109
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
i got a linkedin request uh surprisingly

110
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,440
it was not someone trying to sell me

111
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,479
something or being part of a multi-level

112
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,880
marketing scheme

113
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,680
or

114
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,880
i've even gotten offered because i have

115
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,199
a chinese

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,560
cv

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,120
how to distribute fentanyl from china

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,759
but it wasn't that it uh

119
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
it was just a training gig um it was

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,120
from a person who was looking to train

121
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,320
their team

122
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,840
to do hands-on uh g-pen-like things

123
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,400
where hands-on offensive security but

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,800
instead of um i.t systems concentrate on

125
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
uh ot systems or

126
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,520
the types of systems control systems

127
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,600
that run our critical infrastructure

128
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
they're quite a bit different than your

129
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,840
regular it system in many many ways

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,039
so

131
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,840
i i started looking at the offer it was

132
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,000
it was a lot of money um i can't see

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,800
your your hands but um how many of you

134
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,840
would just accept an offer for a hundred

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,039
thousand euro a month

136
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,840
and that was the offer um they had found

137
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,960
out that i had spoken at a previous

138
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,199
nuclear cyber security event in the

139
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,160
united kingdom and at the time i was

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,720
lecturing for part of gchq for an

141
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,039
organization called uh centers for the

142
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
protection of national infrastructure so

143
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,720
i had been to a lot of uh england and uk

144
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,440
wide nuclear facilities

145
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,919
to discuss cyber security on control

146
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,919
systems with the actual operating

147
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,840
engineers

148
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,720
and

149
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
i as as was said earlier i don't really

150
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,319
uh try to hide a lot of what i do

151
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,400
because i like to be transparent so this

152
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,080
information was easily found and uh they

153
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
even offered me

154
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
to take me on a tour around iran and

155
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,720
have pictures with their generals

156
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
shaking their hands and so forth now

157
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,840
because my military background i i knew

158
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,199
that this was

159
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,680
extremely dodgy

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,720
not

161
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
particularly legal and also it would

162
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,039
have been part of propaganda

163
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,000
and i didn't really want any part of it

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,680
but uh i was very curious how deep they

165
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
were going to take this and if i could

166
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,680
collect any names for various

167
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
authorities

168
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,400
so

169
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
as was described in the previous uh

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
presentation there are a lot of

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
elaborate campaigns that are set up

172
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,840
between social media fake websites etc

173
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,199
well in this case a friend of mine um i

174
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,199
asked him to take a look at some of the

175
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,440
things because the wall street journal

176
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
was looking into this particular story

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
and he found that uh the iranian

178
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
government had set up a series of what's

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,599
called sock puppets on various social

180
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,080
media especially linkedin they had set

181
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
up various fake websites fake personas

182
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,479
everything uh to try to uh get me to

183
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,560
think that they were legitimate i did

184
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,199
not think they were legitimate

185
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,120
and because of it i'm like well you know

186
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,520
i'm collecting these names

187
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,280
all this stuff is going on this doesn't

188
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,400
seem very legal uh trying to bribe me

189
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,120
trying to uh get me to tell information

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
about a former company i worked for

191
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,199
which was saudi aramco

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,919
and knowing the background between saudi

193
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,400
and iran where when i worked for saudi

194
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,840
aramco

195
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,160
i saw firsthand the amount of cyber

196
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,720
attacks launched by iran

197
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,680
i

198
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,080
made my list and i started uh

199
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,039
emailing and i had gotten contact

200
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
information from an fbi

201
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,680
agent who did a presentation at security

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
b-sides years ago

203
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,199
and i was sending emails like here's our

204
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,039
conversations here's our whatsapp

205
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,319
conversations this doesn't seem right

206
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,080
is there anything else i can collect and

207
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,960
do and i had gotten no response

208
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,120
well turns out he had no longer worked

209
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
for the fbi and they just left the

210
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,800
mailbox open

211
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
so then

212
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,799
i tried the department of treasury

213
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,799
which is the organization in the u.s

214
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,320
which does a lot of

215
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,559
public sanctioning of what you can do

216
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,120
what you can't do with certain countries

217
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
or people

218
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,680
and uh i did not get a response from

219
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
them either

220
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
so then i tried the cia tip line because

221
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,560
they have a tip line and

222
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
i left four messages it turns out the

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,760
recording was hello we are the cia this

224
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
is the office of public relations and

225
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,839
i'm a little confused

226
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,680
thinking well why would you have the

227
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,920
office of public relations link to your

228
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
tip line which happens to be on your

229
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,959
website uh the recording was was very

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,160
strange it gave you a reference number

231
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,959
uh

232
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,519
so that um whenever you called back and

233
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,120
i guess left a message you could use the

234
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,440
reference number and i tried and tried

235
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,240
and tried with this particular

236
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,640
reference number and did not get a

237
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,080
response

238
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
now it was at this point i'm thinking

239
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,000
well you know i mean it can't be that

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
big of a deal

241
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,959
because

242
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,959
no one is responding to me

243
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,160
so

244
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,040
all right i'll just keep playing a game

245
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,720
and seeing how

246
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,680
deep they particularly take this and it

247
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,839
started in

248
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,279
2016 and in 2019

249
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,399
i was at a friend's retirement ceremony

250
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,880
in january uh

251
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,680
over at west point because he retired uh

252
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,480
as a military officer and a professor

253
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,360
there

254
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
and we're having drinks uh the

255
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,040
conversation is free-flowing we're all

256
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,839
having a good time i look at my phone

257
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,839
and there's a whatsapp message

258
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040
i'm like huh and i start laughing and

259
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
this guy next to me he's like oh what

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,760

262
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,200
that and i'm like oh

263
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,160
well

264
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,640
not quite uh it's uh

265
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,519
it's uh well it's a message from the

266
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,519
iranian government and they want to give

267
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,720
me a gift

268
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,079
um

269
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,880
he was no longer laughing

270
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,480
um in the meantime during all of this uh

271
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,839
they sent a lot of messages over

272
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
whatsapp

273
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,480
and

274
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,519
um

275
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,839
they had offered a couple of weeks

276
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,959
earlier

277
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,120
hey how you doing

278
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,079
i'm like hey i'm doing fine they're like

279
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,760
i'm telling them i'm like listen you

280
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,480
know

281
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
uh there are these sanctions i don't i

282
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,839
don't think i can do business with you

283
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,000
because quite frankly i don't want to go

284
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
to a u.s jail

285
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,480
and

286
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,880
or an iranian jail but the us wants

287
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
and uh

288
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,560
he says in whatsapp very openly you know

289
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
hey uh

290
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,839
yeah

291
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,160
there are a lot of eu companies doing

292
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,640
business with us just you know of course

293
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,000
not directly

294
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,800
uh so trying to get me to break

295
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
sanctions which would have put me in

296
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,279
jail to do business with them

297
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,000
so

298
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,880
the message that he sends me i assume

299
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
it's a he i'm not sure

300
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,600
um

301
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,959
was like hey chris how you doing

302
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,440
like doing fine he's like

303
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
so uh

304
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,360
can i get your home address because we'd

305
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,839
like to send you a gift

306
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,440
and that's what got me laughing so hard

307
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,240
at this retirement ceremony because um

308
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,600
if you're not

309
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,079
friends with a government i don't care

310
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,920
which government you don't really expect

311
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,760
a gift but especially from the iranian

312
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,839
government due to my background

313
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,720
um i wasn't sure if this would be a a

314
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,560
gift of you know something mundane or

315
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,720
a gift where the bomb disposal unit

316
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
would have to be called out

317
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,760
um

318
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,800
because

319
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
unfortunately

320
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
there have been

321
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,560
uh numerous terrorist attacks and

322
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,839
assassinations directly attributed to

323
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,680
the iranian government and iranian

324
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
embassies throughout europe with a

325
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,079
conviction earlier this year of an

326
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,720
iranian diplomat who claimed diplomatic

327
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,200
immunity but yet gave bomb-making

328
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,120
material uh to a couple i believe it was

329
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,639
in vienna

330
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
uh because the iranian government

331
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,839
decided uh there was going to be a big

332
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,040
rally of a particular iranian government

333
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,519
in exile a group of people who are like

334
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,959
hey we don't like the current iranian

335
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,839
government uh this needs to change

336
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,240
and the plan was to kill as many people

337
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,639
as possible at that rally in europe

338
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,519
so uh i spoke to the fbi finally through

339
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
this guide this guy who was standing

340
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,839
next to me at this uh retirement party

341
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,480
just so happened to work for the fbi and

342
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,079
deal with cyber

343
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,079
so

344
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,320
they they got a team together started an

345
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,200
investigation and said listen we we fear

346
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,639
for your safety um the netherlands uh

347
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,800
where you usually live uh they have

348
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,360
attributed two assassinations from the

349
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,519
iranian government against people in the

350
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,720
netherlands

351
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,279
and uh don't have any more contact with

352
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,360
them um and uh you know try to be safe

353
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,680
and we'll alert you if we hear any sort

354
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,839
of chatter against you and so forth

355
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,800
so

356
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
uh last year before covid

357
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,959
um

358
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,760
after things have been kind of quiet and

359
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
i thought that things were a bit over

360
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
i'm like well you know

361
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
um i think other security researchers

362
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,040
should know that uh this particular

363
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,120
government or other governments could

364
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,199
try to give us enormous amounts of money

365
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,480
because trust me i could have used a

366
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,240
hundred thousand a month i could have

367
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,959
paid off my mortgage with one month

368
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,920
and um you know it can be very enticing

369
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,880
but if you don't know uh what

370
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,839
is really going on with geopolitics

371
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,920
and so forth it can be easy to get

372
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
wrapped up there are certain things that

373
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,839
uh

374
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,360
governments uh will do to try to get you

375
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,839
to be one of their agents

376
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,360
some of them you know obviously trying

377
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,040
to be very nice because it's lasted for

378
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,000
years um offering you gifts which could

379
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,160
be illegal to take uh for me it's

380
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
illegal to take a gift from the iranian

381
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,240
government and they can hook you in once

382
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,320
you do even the slightest illegal thing

383
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,959
that you might not even know about

384
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,680
so i went public and rs technica

385
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,079
published a story with some of the

386
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,279
messages

387
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,920
and researched it was like wow you know

388
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,160
this is pretty interesting you know

389
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,720
and uh shortly after going public and

390
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,279
the article coming out i was alerted by

391
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,839
one of my friends at a cert organization

392
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,320
in europe that they had found my home

393
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
address uh some of my personal

394
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,199
information and pictures of my house

395
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,560
on various extremist websites listing me

396
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,199
as an enemy of iran

397
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,360
and trying to say that i had a fatwa

398
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
against me uh meaning hey i must be an

399
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
outlaw anybody can kill me uh so that

400
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,320
was uh a bit interesting last year

401
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,959
and uh so it kind of pissed me off

402
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,639
because i don't like bullies and uh so

403
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,000
instead

404
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,440
what i did was i had read about a new

405
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,560
iranian law at the time which said that

406
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,680
any mixed gender uh place such as a

407
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,040
restaurant

408
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,519
or anything like that you know

409
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,399
entertainment food wise had to have a

410
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,680
camera

411
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,199
looking at the patrons of the restaurant

412
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,360
and that camera had to be watched by the

413
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,680
religious portion of their police

414
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
so i don't know about you but i was

415
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,160
thinking wait a second so you're telling

416
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,959
me

417
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,199
that a country that can only buy cameras

418
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,680
from china basically

419
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,279
is going to set up

420
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,199
thousands of these things

421
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,440
and going back to

422
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,800
police

423
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,360
to be viewable and

424
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
i started to question

425
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,519
well something tells me they won't have

426
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,000
very much of any security

427
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,759
well it turns out they had like no

428
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,120
security

429
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
so i found over 10 000 of their cameras

430
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,279
and they use one particular manufacturer

431
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,320
for them

432
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
for the majority called hickvision if

433
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
you're curious you can actually look up

434
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,880
various exploits for

435
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,519
hick vision

436
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,560
because they're still around and

437
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
for ease of use for the police they're

438
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,800
not going to

439
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,759
want

440
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,599
everyone to have uh different

441
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,119
credentials for these cameras

442
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,839
it's just too much overhead

443
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,280
so um

444
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,119
found the cameras i could even adjust

445
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,439
the resolution on the cameras i could

446
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,480
turn on

447
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,319
uh audio if the cameras uh actually were

448
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,919
set up for audio

449
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,760
and uh so i

450
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,919
you know took my own little revenge and

451
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,039
uh gave that information to uh the us

452
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,919
government for various uh purposes that

453
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,480
they could do with it such as facial

454
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,320
recognition finding people on a

455
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
terrorist list etc

456
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,679
so

457
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,760
i turned the iranian surveillance state

458
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,480
against itself

459
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,799
and iran is uniquely vulnerable because

460
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,039
they have a ton

461
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
of systems

462
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,919
that

463
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,520
are out there and exposed to the

464
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,559
internet

465
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,559
there's a disconnect between their

466
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,679
offensive security side which is

467
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,960
fairly good at times and actually taking

468
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
cyber security seriously

469
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,480
and this graph will be important for the

470
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,520
last part of what i've been doing lately

471
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,200
so um

472
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,919
then i i started getting some some

473
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,280
messages

474
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,880
and uh

475
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,120
these messages started this year after

476
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,960
another story came out

477
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,120
and i happen to know friends and this is

478
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,480
a great thing about attending

479
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
conferences like this either in person

480
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,440
or online try to make friends uh because

481
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
you never know who the other person is

482
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,080
on

483
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,480
the other end of the computer one of my

484
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,559
friends used to be a

485
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,280
uh investigator for an intelligence

486
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,480
agency another friend that i went to uh

487
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,360
worked for cyber but a

488
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,960
for the terrorism police in a eu country

489
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,559
and they gave me a lot of very good

490
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,919
advice and looked into the matter and uh

491
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,720
because they were credible threats uh

492
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,600
the fbi got involved again as well as

493
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,960
the secret service uh for i i hope

494
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,520
uh the first and only time ever i was

495
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
included in a white house intelligence

496
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,400
report this year uh that was most likely

497
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,760
seen by uh president biden

498
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,480
so

499
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
uh this new story came out that was a

500
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,280
bit more in depth and this happened in

501
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,160
late january early february and it was a

502
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
story on a podcast i did for the middle

503
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,679
east institute

504
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,200
which uh

505
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,120
went through the story of them trying to

506
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,080
recruit me and also the fact that i

507
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,919
hacked all their stuff

508
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,000
uh and turned their surveillance against

509
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,799
them

510
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,799
and the story ended with

511
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,360
uh if you're gonna

512
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,440
that's the f word with me

513
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
i'm gonna hack your stuff revenge is

514
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,840
best served over iot i did say in the

515
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,919
beginning of this i'm a bit snarky and i

516
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,000
also don't like bullies

517
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,120
so

518
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,360
this uh new series of messages started

519
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,080
coming in they actually uh referenced uh

520
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,880
the news article directly

521
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,600
and uh they were deemed credible enough

522
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,600
that uh between february and september i

523
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,799
couldn't go home

524
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,760
uh

525
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
the police came around um they talked to

526
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,480
all my neighbors none of my neighbors

527
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
knew what i did for a living and

528
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,559
suddenly they're like

529
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,200
what do you do for a living

530
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,240
and one of my neighbors brand new baby

531
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
uh here the police are going yeah we've

532
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,840
got this credible threat against your

533
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,120
neighbor um because of you know the

534
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,799
iranian government might want to kill

535
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,559
her but you know

536
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,960
anything that you see suspect or just

537
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,240
out of order don't call the

538
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
non-emergency line call the emergency

539
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,559
line

540
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,200
and of course they're freaking out so uh

541
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,799
it's a great way to know your neighbors

542
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,080
i'll tell you that

543
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,360
uh so i recently got home

544
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,440
and uh

545
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
the amazing thing about this is

546
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,640
uh when i say the iranian offensive is

547
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,360
kind of uh depending on the situation

548
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,080
so the person sending me the messages

549
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,760
i had some friends check out their phone

550
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,039
number

551
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,919
and it turns out that this person had

552
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,080
registered a domain

553
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
and when i looked up the ip address of

554
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,120
the domain the ip address was hosting a

555
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
bunch of

556
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,840
propaganda fake news out of

557
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,080
iran and so um

558
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,960
basically this person uh exposed an

559
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
entire disinformation

560
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,679
operation and of course i gave that

561
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,360
information to the fbi

562
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,799
so present day a couple of weeks ago

563
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,080
um i tweeted a post uh uh i'll i'll be

564
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,039
uh

565
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,799
serious i i thought it was kind of funny

566
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,400
right you know safe word must be at

567
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,919
least eight characters long it contained

568
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,480
one special character um

569
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
unfortunately uh this was right before i

570
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,360
was doing uh this talk in vienna and uh

571
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
so i got another very interesting series

572
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,080
of threats this is one of them and it's

573
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,039
a little uh off-putting when you're told

574
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,679
that someone isn't afraid of martyrdom

575
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,880
so

576
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,840
my next two destinations uh

577
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,720
after receiving this and speaking with

578
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,159
the dutch police

579
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,600
i had an armed escort from nato tuned

580
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,679
from the apartment or excuse me airport

581
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,000
et cetera uh vienna police were made

582
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,679
aware um had to do all sorts of funny

583
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,360
funky uh things to protect my privacy

584
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
to make sure that hopefully nobody was

585
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,960
following me

586
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,039
or wanted to kill me

587
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:45,919
and

588
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,640
uh as a bit of an update so after i do

589
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,280
my talk in vienna

590
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,480
i'm in the

591
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
bathroom because i have a nosebleed and

592
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,280
i'm in the bathroom stall

593
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
trying to you know clean myself up

594
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
because sometimes i get them and

595
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,200
uh

596
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,280
i get this call and it's from my

597
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,720
neighbor the same neighbor with a

598
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
almost brand new baby

599
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,880
a lovely family the neighbor's lovely

600
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,000
and she's like

601
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,440
hi chris

602
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,360
the police are here

603
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,720
um so they had some more information uh

604
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,679
and concerns uh i just happen to be in

605
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,200
vienna not in um the netherlands where i

606
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,559
usually live

607
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,440
and

608
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,120
uh also as i was trying to get to vienna

609
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,240
uh i get a message from a security

610
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
researcher

611
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,000
and it turns out that the iranian

612
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,679
government to

613
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,320
uh offset some of the

614
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,960
things that are going on in iran

615
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,440
they decided to start

616
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,159
doxxing security researchers on iranian

617
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,279
state news television so that particular

618
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,400
researcher um was at first quite you

619
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,360
know like what the heck is going on uh

620
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,279
police are involved terrorism police are

621
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,039
involved et cetera

622
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,600
because these are some of the tactics

623
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,080
that the iranian government is using so

624
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,400
if you are a security researcher who

625
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,679
handles

626
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,200
incidents or malware or whatever

627
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,240
and you get known for handling anything

628
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,320
that comes from or most likely comes

629
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,559
from the iranian government

630
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,760
we now have a a new vector of attack

631
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,080
against us uh the iranian government is

632
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,960
now making it quite personal and doxing

633
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,679
us on iranian state television your home

634
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,320
address your phone number pictures

635
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,320
uh potentially family members etc

636
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,120
so

637
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,440
this is an ongoing thing

638
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,919
i don't have my location disclosed at

639
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,640
the moment under police advice

640
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,840
uh and i am uh trying to keep moving uh

641
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
because i've gotten a few more direct

642
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,279
threats than this

643
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,480
uh and uh we'll we'll see the outcome

644
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
but uh hopefully i will see all of you

645
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,600
post copied and be able to give updates

646
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,039
so uh

647
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,200
some things to consider

648
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,679
because technology is now intertwined

649
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,799
with geopolitics we have to expect

650
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,640
geopolitics to do geopolitics so there's

651
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,799
a rise of all sorts of cyber espionage

652
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,240
going on

653
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,120
whether it be by a nation-state or

654
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,240
um

655
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,960
a competing company uh these things are

656
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,480
occurring more and more

657
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
uh i have been involved in a few you

658
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
could say cyber warfare events

659
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,480
uh in the middle east and they're only

660
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,360
getting bigger trying to hit um all

661
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,320
sorts of uh critical infrastructure

662
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,200
affecting human lives etc earlier this

663
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,880
year i was moderating a panel uh with

664
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,360
someone from saudi aramco and they

665
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
divulged during the panel

666
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,840
that they had stopped an attack from the

667
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,440
iranians against their critical

668
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,520
infrastructure and the intent of the

669
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,559
attack

670
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,480
uh was to kill thousands of civilians

671
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,799
so these things are becoming

672
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,480
more and more

673
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,960
a real everyday thing instead of

674
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,440
something that we thought might happen

675
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,200
in a trashy airport novel

676
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,360
when you try to contact the police it's

677
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,679
not always easy i remember back in

678
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,720
february when i started getting um

679
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,679
the first messages of this year i wasn't

680
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,400
sure

681
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,039
who to contact uh because i was in the

682
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,360
netherlands and so i called the police

683
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
not emergency number and i'm trying to

684
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,320
tell this guy i'm like yeah so you know

685
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,159
this is a long-standing thing but you

686
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,520
know these are more serious threats and

687
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,600
he starts laughing like i'm a crazy

688
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,559
person

689
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,000
because i've just

690
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,080
told him that the iranian government is

691
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,400
sending me death threats

692
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,840
so

693
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,000
i started laughing myself because if you

694
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,679
get a call like that you're going to

695
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,320
think that the person is insane i might

696
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,200
not have much sanity left but i think

697
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,880
maybe hopefully i might still be sane

698
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,559
so because of that um the dutch police

699
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,039
and other police have been working quite

700
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,720
a bit on this with me and about other

701
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,080
individuals who may be affected

702
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,200
and

703
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,360
lastly if it's if it's

704
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,960
legal and ethical

705
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,320
um

706
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,240
i don't know i don't like bullies so i

707
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
like to uh

708
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,399
get rid of bullies um

709
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,760
ethically hack um

710
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,840
and i've uh

711
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
lately been um

712
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,520
getting

713
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,320
deeper into this because again i like to

714
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,240
take revenge uh so uh i have been

715
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,320
working on various iranian targets um

716
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,279
and having a lot of fun so

717
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,240
uh we'll see how this progresses and

718
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,799
what else i can hack on the iranian

719
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,760
government

720
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,880
for uh trying to uh

721
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,520
bully me and censor me

722
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,320
so

723
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,279
if you'd like to know more uh a quick

724

and uh there's a way to contact me

731
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,559
through my communications department

732
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,480
because i had to remove my email from

733
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,240
the website because

734
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,399
that particular website was

735
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,240
uh

736
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,440
a risk

737
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,480
so

738
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,679
um

739
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,520

740
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,760

being here and thank you for doing all

757
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,399
of this work and for setting this

758
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,880
example of courage and ethics i think

759
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,840
that we can all see

760
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,640
how

761
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
not just how big of a toll something

762
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
like this can take but how much courage

763
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
and resilience and persistence it takes

764
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,320
to be able to live through this and this

765
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,080
is not your first time i know that we

766
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,399
talked about the the similar situation

767
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,240
and you talked about a similar situation

768
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,679
in 2019

769
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,120
we're just in

770
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,440
awe of your just your courage and

771
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,840
example i think that these are

772
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,720
so

773
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,039
um powerful for everyone i mean we

774
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,120
you know it's all it's all fun and

775
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,399
not fun and games but it can appear that

776
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,880
cyber security is all fun and games but

777
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,960
the stakes are very real the impact is

778
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,840
very real uh both her on our personal

779
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,679
selves kind of and

780
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,720
then again on our societies as a whole

781
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,799
uh and i i see that people are thanking

782
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,559
you in the chat as well for for your

783
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,799
presentations i do have to say that it

784
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,200
is difficult to find questions to ask

785
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
after a presentation like this i mean

786
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,720
we all feel kind of that we need to

787
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,919
sit for a moment and take a breather

788
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,600
but speaking of

789
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,799
you know

790
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,120
something that i asked don as well

791
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,520
how have you managed i think that thank

792
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,679
you for mentioning the fact about making

793
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,600
friends about

794
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,240
having each other's back about having

795
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,840
someone to reach out to whenever

796
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,679
something bad happens whether it's

797
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,519
smaller or huge

798
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,840
uh and i wanted to ask how do you take

799
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,919
care of yourself and in your mental

800
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,080
health throughout an experience like

801
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
this it seems

802
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,399
just absolutely overwhelming

803
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,120
well i'm going to take my first vacation

804
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,320
and 11 years starting on sunday

805
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,840
uh

806
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,120
that's that's celebrating with you

807
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,360
um and and it's something i should have

808
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,880
done obviously before because i'm uh

809
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,799
kind of tired of the situation um

810
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,880
but uh

811
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,480
it can be difficult

812
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,120
and that again is where uh friends can

813
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,880
come into play uh because um

814
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,399
talking about things helps having a

815
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,960
person or people that will listen and

816
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,799
vice versa when people have uh difficult

817
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,679
choices to make or difficult uh

818
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,120
situations

819
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,039
and

820
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,440
luckily with our wonderful internet we

821
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,360
can talk to our friends uh whenever uh

822
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,640
and wherever they are but friends uh a

823
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,600
good friend is better than probably any

824
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,519
therapist and

825
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,480
certain situations

826
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,960
that is so absolutely true and

827
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,120
i i'm sure that i speak for all of us

828
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,320
when i say

829
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,039
that we wish you not nothing but the

830
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,600
best and we hope that you have a chance

831
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,360
to take care of yourself and uh that you

832
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,039
know there's a

833
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,360
let's say a long-term solution to this

834
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,200
uh and thank you for your bravery and

835
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,039
thank you for your contribution to the

836
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,480
community you're one of the most

837
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,960
generous people that i know and so many

838
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,200
others share and echo my sentiment

839
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
because you've helped them and helped

840
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,080
them help lift them help expand their

841
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,000
voice and help them trust themselves

842
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,760
that they can make a meaningful

843
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,840
contribution to not just cyber security

844
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,600
but making the world a better place

845
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,760
because that's kind of one of the main

846
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,320
