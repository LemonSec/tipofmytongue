1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,360
next we have a panel that's focused on

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,960
women in cyber security about a month

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,360
ago i wrote a piece about

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,759
our inability to assess the risk of

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,400
potential cyber security incidents

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,679
and

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,680
i looked at some of the psychological

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,240
factors and cognitive biases that come

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,000
into play

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,920
and one of the things that i've learned

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,800
was that teams that are more diverse

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,320
tend to be better at um assessing risk

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,200
and here at deaf camp one of the goals

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,480
is to help create a diverse and um

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
supportive community and if you are here

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
with us today i'm sure that this is

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,600
something that you're thinking a lot

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,399
about

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,879
we'll hear more about ways to um

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,280
encourage diverse voices and mer make

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,199
our community more inclusive during the

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,879
next panel moderated by valentin mere

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,440
yes hi i'm here

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
okay happy to see you did i pronounce

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,800
your name all right

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,760
yeah

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,640
fantastic um

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
why is it um

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
important to you to talk about this

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,000
topic why do you think we should spend

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,360
more time reflecting on making women uh

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,439
more powerful within the cyber security

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,600
community

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,439
oh that's a tough question but i know

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
uh i think it's important to um

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,320
more to put women forwards um asking

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,159
tough cyber security questions and and

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,840
just tackling

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,920
cyber security challenges with women on

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
the front because

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,759
of representation

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,640
um i think it can inspire some younger

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,799
generations to

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,880
strive for these roles

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
not only women but just show more

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
diverse um

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
yeah diverse people that actually do

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,200
some hard work in cyber security and not

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,719
just

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,280
be there to be some kind of uh

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,680
token uh person on a poster or something

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,160
that's uh i think that that's more what

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,758
i would say about this

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,200
um i have

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,160
hopes that uh it will change that the

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,160
the ratios will change because i've

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,720
already seen a lot of teenage girls

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
highly interested in cyber security so

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
i'm i'm confident that in a couple of

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,680
years we won't need this anymore

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,280
as much as we do now

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
um but in the meantime we should indeed

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,239
put women forward and ask the the tough

64
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,720
questions and show that women and

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,599
other diverse communities can also do

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
some hard cyber security i was

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,440
just wanting to ask you this specific

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
thing uh because you mentioned teenagers

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,680
how were things when you grew up and

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,959
whether

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,599
the number of women that had jobs in

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,000
science technology medicine economics um

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,599
was something that

74
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,280
influenced you

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
in choosing a career in in this field

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,400
um

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
so when i go when i wasn't in high

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,040
school uh being

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,159
um

80
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,360
a gamer

81
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
um i was the only

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,319
girl

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,680
in the circles

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,040
um

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,080
it was uh yeah yeah it was for guys for

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,879
for

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,599
young for young white guys with glasses

88
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,799
that was uh

89
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,959
those computers that that's what it was

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,920
for

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,760
um but i think tv helps me a lot some

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,239
sci-fi series actually that showed women

93
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,239
as scientists and stuff that helped a

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,000
lot um

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,040
so that's why i think that

96
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
representation is

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,280
is just a big motivator for

98
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,959
young girls

99
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,799
to have someone that they can look up to

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,480
even if it's not a real person for me it

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,200
was uh samantha carter in uh stargate

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
sg1 but uh

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,400
for others it may be uh the the next uh

104
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,439
ceo of avast that's um

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,560
yeah

106
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,159
yeah i think it's it's really important

107
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,040
to see that there are people like you

108
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,000
who are doing a great job and you just

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,640
don't have to be alone in in all this

110
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
and we talk a lot here in in romania

111
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,478
about having systems that help foster

112
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,279
talents that are diverse and

113
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,918
in order to to grow and be a

114
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,000
professional it helps a lot if you're

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,840
surrounded by people who who support you

116
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,000

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,720
what i'm doing during my uh more than 14

years of expertise in data protection

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,319
and privacy and in the recent few years

204
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,840
in the field of empowering women in

205
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,560
cyber security in different areas

206
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,280
is first of all to raise the awareness

207
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,240
is the key question seen from my side

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,479
both for the society and for the

209
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,160
individuals as well and also uh to lead

210
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,680
as an example

211
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
following my personal motto inspire and

212
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
let yourself be inspired

213
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,199
that's why i will raise here one

214
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,199
question at the beginning not a question

215
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,719
but uh uh thought to think about uh and

216
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,599
maybe to to talk about more later in our

217
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,559
discussion uh related to different kind

218
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,120
of mentorship programs i'm also a mentor

219
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
right now

220
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,680
to some few young girls in the field of

221
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,920
cyber security different areas of cyber

222
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,399
security but also the importance of role

223
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,440
models

224
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
because when i find very

225
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,800
important and at the same time uh in a

226
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
way in a crisis

227
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,279
during this time is the exact role

228
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,519
models female role models which are

229
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,880
going to to serve as a direction a kind

230
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,680
of direction to all the girls and young

231
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,959
women who want to start their careers in

232
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,320
cyber security or where uh or also to

233
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,800
those who want to go deeper

234
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,680
and

235
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
especially to those which want to get

236
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,399
higher on the scale because we know

237
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
although the percentage of women of

238
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
women in cyber security is around

239
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,040
depending on

240
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,440
on the statistics and the analysis but

241
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,399
around 22 to 25

242
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,320
the decision-making and executive

243
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,279
positions and cyber security leaded by

244
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,839
women are even lower around 80 percent

245
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,480
in uh for instance in the european union

246
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
countries and that's why

247
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,640
i i'm dedicating my activities

248
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,040
mostly on how to inspire women to see

249
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,440
what are the benefits for them

250
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,480
uh joining the cyber security instead of

251
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,360
only work with society and companies to

252
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,640
see the benefits from having more women

253
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,360
women on cyber security stage because

254
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,279
first of all we need to inspire women

255
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,399
themselves

256
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,640
as someone mentioned uh

257
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,120
to portray differently uh someone

258
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,200
working in cyber security instead of

259
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,880
being a male a boy or a man uh in front

260
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
of with glasses with us in front working

261
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,800
in front of something very boring and

262
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
working in front of several screens

263
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
that's it from me at the beginning

264
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,200
thanks

265
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,040
raising uh the right questions i think

266
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
um thank you

267
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,839
next i have dimitro

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,360
yes hello

269
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,079
um i'm really happy to be part of this

270
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,360
panel with these amazing professionals i

271
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
look up to

272
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,480
my experience in cyber security started

273
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,760
a bit over six years ago

274
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,040
i worked my way through the trenches

275
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
from working in stock to building

276
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
security services from scratch

277
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,600
and ended up securing uh stacks with the

278
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,279
latest technology

279
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
um my current role is that of the threat

280
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,279
hunter at crowdstrike i work in the

281
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,680
endpoint content endpoint platform

282
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,519
content department of crowdstrike and my

283
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,680
main role is to

284
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,880
follow and stop as fast as i can any

285
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,040
attackers adversaries that

286
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,320
target linux based infrastructures

287
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,839
and

288
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,279
switching my focus again to containers

289
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,560
as well

290
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,680
um as everyone has stated i do believe

291
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,160
that it is important for women

292
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,880
and not only women for everyone

293
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
to

294
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,639
understand and believe that with hard

295
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,240
work and

296
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
with dedication and passion for this

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
industry

298
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,160
anyone can make it um i think i'm a

299
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,200
pretty good example of that because i my

300
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,680
ba is in political sciences so i

301
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,000
basically had to work from scratch to

302
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,040
where i am

303
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,320
so i really hope that um

304
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,120
my example will um

305
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,399
will encourage

306
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,880
young ladies or not only that are

307
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,240
thinking about switching to cyber

308
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,200
security to do so

309
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,880
that's um a very noble goal i when um

310
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
so i host this community in the

311
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,399
netherlands of women in cyber security

312
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,079
and we have so many

313
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,200
um women but also just

314
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,440
random people who come from different

315
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,720
backgrounds we also have someone in

316
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,160
political sciences uh coincidentally um

317
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,040
and they are they feel so insecure that

318
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
that they will never make it into the

319
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
field that it's really nice to see

320
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,839
other ladies who come from uh completely

321
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,440
different opposite even opposite

322
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,399
backgrounds uh one of my top hacker

323
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,120
friends is from marketing of all places

324
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,079
and um yeah so it's really nice to see

325
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,959
that

326
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,399
um i think we're missing the last plan

327
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,760
speaker

328
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,720
so

329
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,480
andrada you can

330
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
introduce yourself as well yeah um i'm

331
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
happy to step in i'm andrada i'm a

332
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,920
technology journalist um i was born in

333
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,800
transylvania but moved here to bucharest

334
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,639
15 years ago

335
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,680
i think um i'm super excited to be

336
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,760
talking about women in security because

337
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
i think i've written four or five

338
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,639
stories um on this topic so far and i do

339
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,320
feel that um

340
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,519
in romania we are fortunate to have um

341
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,399
to be i think the second eu country when

342
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,880
it comes to the number the percentage of

343
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,560
women who are employed in technology um

344
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
i'm a technology journalist and when i

345
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,680
started there were only men covering

346
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,880
technology in romania

347
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,440
and things were a little bit different i

348
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,360
was called harry potter

349
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
because i wear glasses and no one

350
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,839
thought that i could do this job

351
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,720
but

352
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
i did it um i'm a former night science

353
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,560
journalism fellow at mit i work for

354
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,199
radio station here in bucharest and i

355
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,160
try to to talk a lot about women in

356
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,000
technology with men

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
because i feel that uh they should be

358
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,160
part of the change and um

359
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,560
if we are meeting and talking about this

360
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,600
issue is one thing but if we try to

361
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,120
involve them then i think the war

362
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,480
uh can be

363
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,800
run

364
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,519
yeah that's true it's not a war it's a

365
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,160
cooperative game right so we should all

366
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,079
work together yeah

367
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:56,839
that's

368
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,600
better thank you

369
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,560
but um yeah i agree so thank you for uh

370
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,959
for introducing yourselves uh i'll just

371
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
then dive right into the questions

372
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,519
um so the questions themselves concern

373
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
some cyber security challenges in

374
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
general feel free to give your input

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
a technical input or social input

376
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
anything you think that that fits

377
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,120
the answer so the first question

378
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,079
um

379
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,000
so we know that the world is changing

380
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,440
and everything is becoming so

381
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,680
digitalized i mean it's it's or it

382
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,199
already is in a lot of countries that

383
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,720
you cannot do anything if the internet

384
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,759
is down

385
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,600
um so cyber threats and risks are

386
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
increasing and just exponentially

387
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,360
um for you what is the biggest security

388
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,199
challenge you're actively tackling in

389
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,959
your job or in your hobby life and um

390
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,959
how what what advice would you give

391
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,560
other companies who face some of these

392
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,800
issues so i'll start in the order of the

393
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,759
introduction introductions and

394
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,279
you can have these discussions how you

395
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,639
want um

396
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,560
but um i'll ask gretzella

397
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,480
to start me first thank you

398
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
um

399
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,480
i would um i would use uh different

400
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
sources for um what are responding to

401
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,360
the question because um as i mentioned

402
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
in my real life i'm more close to the

403
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,440
business and you know those kind of very

404
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,560
high um

405
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,360
things like risk management and ethics

406
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
and role modelling and

407
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,839
my my job is not really related to the

408
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
security part however

409
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,000
i'm fortunate being a part of the

410
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,639
association of isaka and

411
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,800
i've been involved in different working

412
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,759
groups and uh initiatives uh i feel uh i

413
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,759
feel um i'm part of this universe um i'm

414
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,680
i'm passionate about it

415
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
and um i would go anyhow i would go for

416
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
the the human part is not

417
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,120
from the technical perspective it is

418
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,360
from many perspectives um that means um

419
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,279
what i want to say

420
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,600
humans are considered as being the

421
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,839
strongest link and the weakest link in

422
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,880
the same time of organizations

423
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,319
and um

424
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,720
taking this into consideration we can

425
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,280
much more easily understand that um

426
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,559
okay defensive we all discuss about

427
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,359
cyber trades and we need to build our

428
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,760
defense in order to own the future for

429
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,959
external any external um challenge but

430
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,319
in the same time the report uh shows us

431
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,159
that um there are a lot of

432
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,559
miscommunications or not a lot of gaps

433
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,799
internally and most of them are related

434
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,640
to human errors

435
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,039
so with this i would i would make the

436
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,039
connection to um to the education of

437
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,720
people both professionally and

438
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
personally and this led us to all the

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,240
reports that show us

440
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
the needs

441
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,120
which is

442
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,039
reported for

443
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,360
cyber security or information security

444
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,880
specialist at this moment and this need

445
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,039
hasn't been um

446
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,679
met by the available specialists at the

447
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,000
moment there are a lot of reports here

448
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,320
and statistics in this regards and this

449
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,679
leads me to

450
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,799
um the idea of

451
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,520
we are finding ourselves in a situation

452
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,880
when

453
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,280
communication awareness and you know

454
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
that kind of limited training our

455
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,840
organization are providing for them for

456
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,240
you so for the employees

457
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
is not sufficient anymore

458
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,840
then we need a culture for um cyber

459
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,640
security and culture

460
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,880
means a lot of things and

461
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,799
i don't know whether we we shall find

462
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,039
some time to discuss about this but it

463
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,760
is a practical and philosophical

464
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,840
topic in the same time because it is

465
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,080
related to role modeling which is

466
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,240
related to trust it is related to

467
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,799
knowledge it is related to education

468
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,120
um it is related to the passion of

469
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,440
people and um

470
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,400
many other things so um i i made some

471
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,440
links

472
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,400
just pointing out different topics

473
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
i'm passionate passionate about it about

474
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,919
them and

475
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,039
yeah we can develop them or build them

476
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,200
later on on

477
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,160
depending on the time

478
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,280
yeah it's it's funny that you mentioned

479
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,400
um

480
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,520
the human error um i think communication

481
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,000
between different fields also

482
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,039
um

483
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,320
what i mean to say so you have all these

484
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,919
technical people but you have also the

485
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,760
management and you have the c-level

486
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
people and you have the strategist and

487
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,799
they all have to communicate to each

488
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,160
other with each other and they don't

489
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,480
necessarily know how to especially since

490
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,559
cyber security is a field that involves

491
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,760
everybody

492
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,720
um

493
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,240
i think that's also part of the human

494
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,120
error that that we were not necessarily

495
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,640
taught how to communicate on those

496
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,000
different levels

497
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,720
so

498
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
maybe sometimes how to collaborate with

499
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,080
the others um among our peers or in the

500
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
same profession or in between the

501
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
professions

502
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,480
that's true

503
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,200
anyone else wants to um go at it feel

504
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,320
free to respond

505
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,200
yeah i can i will proceed i absolutely

506
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,400
agree with graziella uh and uh

507
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,679
when i was

508
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,720
when i was thinking about how to how

509
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,640
actually uh what

510
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,720
should be my input here

511
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,840
uh in order and a way to inspire i

512
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,640
recently came to the idea a few days ago

513
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,080
while i was doing a zoom meeting test

514
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
preparing for some other meeting it came

515
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
in my uh it came in my view uh one

516
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,120
sentence uh they are saying they are

517
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
more than meetings and they say discover

518
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,000
how you can elevate the way you work by

519
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,039
combining webinars chat and meetings

520
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,840
so actually what i find in the most

521
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,400
challenging cyber security issue or

522
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,640
concern especially having in mind the

523
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,760
recent

524
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
uh

525
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,360
almost two years during the pandemic

526
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,400
time is actually spending too much time

527
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,960
online both privately and especially

528
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,000
professionally which means that

529
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,280
almost in one step through the night

530
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,919
we when i say we i mean as a human

531
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,039
beings but also accompanies institutions

532
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,120
and other legal entities

533
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,840
need to transform absolutely the way

534
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,640
they work the way they approach the

535
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,480
things and the way they are making

536
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,640
decisions and the way they are doing the

537
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,280
task done test done

538
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,679
which means uh it came to my mind that

539
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,559
uh what we need is actually in line with

540
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,360
what graziella said uh we need a kind of

541
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
i'm talking since i'm uh privacy and

542
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,240
data protection expert i tried to

543
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
concentrate more on more on building uh

544
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,400
privacy and data protection culture

545
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,520
not only for individuals themselves as

546
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,240
being someone in the online environment

547
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,000
but also for companies as well but then

548
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
i tried to figure it out

549
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,039
how to make companies to see building

550
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,080
privacy cultures uh privacy culture

551
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
championing data

552
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,919
to see championing data privacy not only

553
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,400
as the right thing to do and not only in

554
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,679
a way to be in line with all those legal

555
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,240
and other requirements but how to

556
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,960
present it in a great way to grow their

557
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
business because in that case we'll have

558
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,559
a kind of win-win situation which means

559
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,200
uh in the recent months i was working

560
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,640
and doing some trainings with companies

561
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,440
in order to show in practice

562
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,840
to companies and other entities what is

563
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,400
the economic value associated with the

564
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,720
company's privacy investment

565
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,440
and how to motivate them the companies

566
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,280
to do the right things when it comes to

567
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,240
data collection and especially to data

568
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
transfers

569
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,720
and i will share here a few points as a

570
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
kind of advice and help

571
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,080
and a motivation for companies in order

572
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,120
to

573
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,200
improve their privacy programs because

574
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
we know that nowadays even nowadays uh

575
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
although the pandemic is not uh

576
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,480
is still a very a large part of our

577
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,159
daily lives but

578
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,440
we are still not fully in line with uh

579
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,600
what we uh we were prior to the pandemic

580
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,000
i'll mention few just

581
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,520
benefits

582
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,760
as i said most often companies are

583
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,640
privacy correct and compliant is a way

584
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
to avoid any kind of risks or threats

585
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,400
but what about tangible business

586
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,880
benefits the companies recognize from

587
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,120
continuing investing in different kind

588
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,440
of tools and programs

589
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,080
way beyond harmonizing with those

590
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,480
just to mention few of them

591
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
first of all they will gain a

592
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
competitive advantage second they will

593
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,760
optimize a personal or

594
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
personal data usage

595
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,159
then they will face with less data

596
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,679
breach cases

597
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,559
less costly data breaches and shorter

598
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,559
system stops

599
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,799
also they will achieve a higher

600
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,760
operational efficiency and for instance

601
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,640
if they

602
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,799
if they are in

603
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,919
goods and services business uh they will

604
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,360
shorter sales delays or shorter service

605
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,120
service deliver

606
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,720
so i will stop here with my um

607
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,679
kind of advices uh and i would say

608
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,600
strong recommendations related to uh one

609
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,720
of cyber security challenges of nowadays

610
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,799
which i see is very important

611
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,279
and i purposely not concentrated on

612
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,480
women in cyber security nowadays

613
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
in the first

614
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,200
related to first question because uh i

615
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
wanted to offer something which would be

616
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
at the same time beneficial to each

617
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,799
individual as a human being no matter

618
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,200
no matter the fact whether it is uh male

619
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,279
uh male or female uh person uh and also

620
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,320
to help companies to see the benefits so

621
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,720
at the end uh that will be beneficial

622
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,200
for for the whole mankind

623
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,840
thanks

624
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
well thank you i'm sure a lot of people

625
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
would benefit from from this wisdom a

626
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,159
lot of companies especially

627
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
um

628
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,039
anyone else wants to pitch in uh yeah

629
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,520
so just to build upon uh what the

630
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,880
gratial and lubicas said um any security

631
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
infrastructure is

632
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,520
as strong as its weakest link being it a

633
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,640
human

634
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,559
end user or sysadmin that configures uh

635
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,159
the infrastructure

636
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,520
or the i.t hygiene and the risks and

637
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,240
vulnerabilities that company accepts

638
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
when it comes to

639
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,679
exposure to threats

640
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,720
so

641
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,360
i believe that

642
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,960
in my personal bubble in my field uh the

643
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,120
biggest security challenge building on

644
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,918
top of that is

645
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,760
building uh or protecting

646
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,320
um infrastructures as i mentioned before

647
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,720
that run on uh stacks that run on

648
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,679
microservices on containers on top of

649
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,960
linux and then taking into consideration

650
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,480
um also that orchestrators might bring

651
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
liabilities and risks and credentials

652
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,480
that could be exposed

653
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,480
so uh yeah a defense in depth uh that

654
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,440
would not interfere with any of this

655
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,039
part of the stack

656
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,320
and

657
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,799
maintain availability

658
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,919
but also protect our customers is i

659
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,600
believe the greatest challenge that i'm

660
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
facing right now

661
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,880
and um

662
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
hopefully we're building the the best

663
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,120
solution out there

664
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,600
and um stopping

665
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,120
adversaries um as they switch their uh

666
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,799
their attention from windows to linux

667
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
and yeah

668
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,279
keeping them behind and not letting them

669
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,600
evolve into something worse than they

670
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,480
are already doing

671
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,880
maintainability is indeed a challenge

672
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,840
for a lot of companies i think

673
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,200
but um

674
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,640
yeah thank you uh for those insights um

675
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,559
andrada do you have something um you

676
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,399
want to share from your journalistic

677
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,000
experience yeah as a journalist my job

678
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,480
is to look at what

679
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,360
techies do and try to translate that for

680
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,240
the general audience and two of the

681
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,080
things i'm i'm always thinking about

682
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,279
when i'm writing stories are why is this

683
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,720
important

684
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,880
and why is this important now

685
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,440
and i feel that when we talk to

686
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,480
stakeholders or

687
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,039
or the general public or colleagues and

688
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,679
friends we um

689
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,960
we are better

690
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
as women

691
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,200
at explaining things and maybe we should

692
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,320
leverage that more um maybe we should

693
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,360
step up and not be afraid to speak our

694
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,399
mind

695
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,279
and um

696
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,960
because

697
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,520
one thing is to know something another

698
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,240
thing is to to know that but share it to

699
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,600
the audience and we also maybe have to

700
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,440
to make an effort to be better

701
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,080
communicators at what we are doing and

702
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,679
to maybe do a little bit of pr on on the

703
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,640
side

704
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
just to

705
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,520
encourage um other women to talk or to

706
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
um

707
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,440
basically

708
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,679
say that there are interesting things

709
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,159
that that are happening right now and we

710
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,840
are the um

711
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,399
advocates for for change

712
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,240
another thing i'm trying to do as a

713
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,039
journalist is to include diverse voices

714
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,640
in my stories

715
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,760
um

716
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,320
and whenever possible i'm trying to

717
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,720
interview women

718
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,399
and um

719
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,480
people that have different backgrounds

720
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,799
or come from various geographical

721
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,360
locations so that the picture i'm

722
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,320
painting is not that white uh

723
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,000
males are

724
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,399
the only people working in in cyber

725
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,159
security right now

726
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,360
so um yeah these were my two cents

727
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,520
yeah so i think we can see a

728
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,440
pattern of uh

729
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,760
that that it relates more to the human

730
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
actually those uh the cyber security

731
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,679
challenges we talked about are actually

732
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,399
all related to to the human and human

733
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,840
perception

734
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,880
um

735
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,640
i don't know if you lubica if you raised

736
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
your hand

737
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,120
intentionally okay yeah

738
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,240
yeah uh i wanted uh yes to share with

739
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,720
you that under uh also andrada had a

740
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,240
great uh

741
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,320
great concern in the issue which she

742
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,440
raised here and also i wanted to add it

743
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,320
here that what we need more and i find

744
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,159
it challenging uh

745
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,120
is that uh with uh actually the

746
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
organizers of the conferences and

747
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,200
different kind of events should have in

748
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,720
mind that it's always a good idea to to

749
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
organize a kind of a kind of special

750
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,159
session dedicated to women questions in

751
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,960
cyber security but i find it more

752
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,039
valuable if

753
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,600
uh the organizers put

754
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,960
more female speakers or more female

755
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
experts within uh specialized sessions

756
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,120
because that way first of all we'll have

757
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,519
the opportunity to present in practice

758
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,760
that we are not just women

759
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,559
with

760
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,840
our female

761
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
positive characteristics and threats but

762
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,200
we are also experts in the field and

763
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,679
at the same time we can always use it as

764
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,120
an opportunity

765
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,679
of coming from the back door to say

766
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,080
something more what will inspire more

767
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,960
women to join the to join the cyber

768
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,159
security community so i find it both

769
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,720
great ways to to involve more women in

770
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,240
the story

771
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,159
just to build on what lupita said

772
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,399
building on what i said before which was

773
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,360
built on what everything said earlier um

774
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,000
there are um also two things that i have

775
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,799
in mind one is that it's not enough to

776
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,519
have women in in technology if we don't

777
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,320
have women in leadership positions uh in

778
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,799
technology and i know that uh graziano

779
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,080
maybe um has something to say about this

780
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,720
so um

781
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,519
i think skills are are super valuable in

782
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,240
in this area but we also need to give

783
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,559
people the chance to be the best they

784
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,519
can be

785
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,320
um

786
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,600
so i should

787
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,679
be a journalist for the for the next 20

788
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,799
seconds and and ask graziella if she

789
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,880
feels that if there are enough women in

790
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,279
in leadership positions

791
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,000
sorry val

792
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,519
it is a fantastic topic i wanted to push

793
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,039
them that i can leave

794
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
the conversation thank you

795
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,279
uh this with a woman in leadership um it

796
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,679
is another longer conversation

797
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,440
um i'm always mixing up um the wording

798
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,080
is feeling glass or glass ceiling uh

799
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,960
umbrella canyon can you correct me

800
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,600
are you familiar with this is that

801
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,039
um

802
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,000
invisible plus

803
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,919
that you can't uh pass it or you can't

804
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,320
overcome it um while you are thinking on

805
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,200
on

806
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,039
going up in a hierarchy

807
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,880
and there are

808
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,200
many researches and many articles and

809
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,640
many books and a lot of uh resources

810
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,240
written

811
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,120
exactly for this uh ceiling glass or

812
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,480
glass ceiling

813
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,240
regarding women and um while i started a

814
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,279
conversation it was a small project like

815
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,600
um let's discuss about this topic

816
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,559
um when i started to read about this i

817
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,600
was

818
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,640
very

819
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,880
sad and amazing the same time because

820
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,559
somehow humanity started to um to

821
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,720
research about this uh somewhere in

822
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,240
1950s so we are 2021 right now and we

823
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,640
are still discussing about it and we do

824
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,919
not still have some um

825
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,760
real solutions okay

826
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,240
we all talk about this and in the visa

827
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,279
progress

828
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,640
reports and statistics show us that

829
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,120
there is a progress and there is another

830
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,360
level of inclusion and

831
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,639
women started to have the courage to

832
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,839
um

833
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,359
take the word and speak and uh and try

834
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,000
to be visible because all of you have

835
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,839
said

836
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,639
probably um it is true like we do have

837
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,679
um

838
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,159
values or valuable women in different

839
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,119
areas not only in technology but usually

840
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,199
we are going on to the psychological

841
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,399
understand also social part and also

842
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,879
cultural background which has an

843
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,239
entrance uh on on everything

844
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,480
but coming back and just to point out

845
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,440
some some some numbers it is true that

846
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,480
um from distance romania is saying very

847
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,520
well in numbers um it's on the second

848
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,920
one or the third um a few years ago um

849
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,880
place

850
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,760
on

851
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,119
women's

852
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,079
in technology

853
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,839
uh however

854
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,920
i would be maybe we will have andrada

855
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,480
sometimes uh later to discuss i would be

856
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,760
very curious to find

857
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,359
an explanation

858
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,359
of the following

859
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,480
numbers so we are on a very good

860
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,960
shape or a very good position comparing

861
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,839
all the other western countries

862
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,160
where we are looking with high

863
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,200
appreciation from many perspectives

864
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,440
uh one link and

865
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,040
i would be very curious for the

866
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,280
reasoning behind why this happens why

867
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,839
this happens to us and the only

868
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,560
information is like um

869
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,079
factual or um absolute information i got

870
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,200
is

871
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,800
the number of the females um

872
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,359
in the tertiary grade

873
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,400
is much more higher than males

874
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,760
so it's like we have a bigger pool of

875
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,040
professionals in tech education

876
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,520
which have

877
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
the opportunity to remain in the field

878
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,079
and to do something

879
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,520
but however um things are um

880
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,760
are not very freed until the very

881
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,960
highest levels of um of the therapy in

882
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,040
the organization but it will be very

883
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,440
interesting to make the link why why

884
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,680
this because i consider for example

885
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,359
speaking about romania because i know

886
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,960
the culture

887
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,680
i intended to say we are much more

888
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,640
traditionalist and not liberal in terms

889
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,359
of supporting women and inclusion and

890
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,480
all those things if you have a point on

891
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,000
this i would be

892
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,920
fantastically curious

893
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,960
yeah um i i wrote something about it i

894
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,920
could um share the link if you want um

895
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,400
one thing is that culturally

896
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,480
there's something there definitely

897
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,720
so the same thing is happening um in

898
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,040
bulgaria so they are number one right

899
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,160
now in europe and a little bit in russia

900
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,440
in i think across eastern europe and um

901
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,920
one explanation is that these were one

902
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,240
of the first countries that pushed for

903
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,880
uh equal rights for men and women within

904
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,320
their constitutions and romania had uh

905
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,960
one of the first engineers um in the

906
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,640
world so who were women so um it allowed

907
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,960
women to go to school exactly uh what

908
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,119
you said um and also uh during the

909
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,359
during communism women had to have a job

910
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,320
which was not true for certain um

911
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,000
western countries

912
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,119
so communists wanted women to go and and

913
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,440
work and be the um

914
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,000
superhero of the working class uh if you

915
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,359
want so that they had to have a job and

916
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,880
if you um

917
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,280
were to graduate with a degree in math

918
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,599
or computer science that would mean that

919
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,760
you're going to be

920
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,320
assigned a job in a city not in the

921
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,800
countryside because all the computing

922
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,920
centers were in in cities so that that

923
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,359
was a passport for having um a good life

924
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,200
for for women

925
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,440
so these are a couple of things that

926
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,920
influenced um

927
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,560
the bigger numbers that are in romania

928
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,280
that are maybe not enough i think we

929
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,400
should do more and uh we should try to

930
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,160
keep the momentum if possible

931
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,839
thank you i think

932
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,880
i have something to add providing this

933
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,440
yeah uh i wanted to share uh my

934
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,760
experience here in north macedonia which

935
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,440
is another part of the european union

936
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,520
but it's following

937
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,960
the latest the the legislation and all

938
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,760
good practices when it comes to

939
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,720
women in cyber security and girls and

940
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,680
the statistics are showing that uh

941
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,160
the percentage of girls

942
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,520
within the

943
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,960
faculty faculty education and car uh

944
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,400
higher education

945
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,880
of different range are even higher than

946
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
the male participation than the boys

947
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,920
participation but unfortunately uh the

948
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,800
trouble happened after they finish

949
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,640
although as you said

950
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,040
is the same here with higher grades and

951
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,000
more successful than uh male candidates

952
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,520
but uh the travel happened a bit later

953
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,880
when they come not only in a position to

954
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,920
to get active on the

955
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,000
labor market but uh later uh when when

956
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,560
they usually come in in that period of

957
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,560
their personal life when they want to

958
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,160
become mothers

959
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,800
and to be a professional at the same

960
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,040
time and to to get a higher uh

961
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,520
well-deserved position and having in

962
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,320
mind that the things in cyber security

963
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,560
are happening in information change are

964
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,520
happening very fast and unfortunately

965
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,160
all we as human beings can be in step

966
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,040
with uh with those uh challenges and uh

967
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,720
we are constantly in time race it's even

968
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,599
uh it's even harder for women

969
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,680
in that period of their life and having

970
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,880
in mind uh the changes in cyber security

971
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,200
environment it's even harder for for

972
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,440
women to to follow

973
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,839
that step and what we are right now

974
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,160
doing uh in my country as an

975
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,240
organization is women for cyber north

976
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
macedonia we are trying exactly to

977
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,599
figure it out what was the reason

978
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,839
the main reason there are always several

979
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,359
reasons but what is uh the the main

980
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,880
reason why women uh at some stage of

981
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,599
their career had stopped to to go to

982
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,240
want and to be motivated uh

983
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,440
or uh able to to go higher in their

984
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,920
positions so i'll be glad to share when

985
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,680
we get the results we are working it's a

986
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,160
kind of analysis server but

987
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,720
i will i will be happy and for sure we

988
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,800
are going to publish

989
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,599
those results

990
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,720
yes please please share the results

991
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,520
once it gets published um for the sake

992
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,880
of time i need to

993
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,440
get some speed on the questions um i

994
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,280
think we sort of answered the second one

995
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,200
already which was the a hot topic you

996
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
wish people talked more about in the

997
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,440
infosec community and we talked about

998
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,599
the human error we talked about more

999
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,400
diversity um does anyone want to add

1000
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,040
something to this uh something you wish

1001
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,800
that we tackled more

1002
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,720
and why do you believe it's important

1003
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,240
and do you think we're changing in the

1004
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,160
right direction

1005
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,520
if somebody wants to pitch in

1006
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,880
i can have something to add on the list

1007
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,520
for sure we will not reach a conclusion

1008
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,240
but

1009
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,920
it was something which captured my

1010
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,480
attention the other days um

1011
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,520
and uh this was related to a statement

1012
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,640
like

1013
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,720
um

1014
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,839
cyber security and e for security is the

1015
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,040
approach is a tech function and should

1016
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,839
be approached as a business function

1017
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,880
and this is somehow related to

1018
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,760
the entire story with the shift in the

1019
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,839
organizational culture

1020
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,040
and

1021
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
it is a much

1022
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,200
linked as well to the education of

1023
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,920
people that but not only the one for

1024
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,480
performing the ones for performing some

1025
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,839
operational

1026
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,359
things then um the link to

1027
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,480
raising awareness and educating uh the

1028
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,920
top management that means

1029
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,119
there is a there is a trend uh people in

1030
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,040
um

1031
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,440
or the specialists who are the

1032
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,800
required

1033
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,359
in right now for information security or

1034
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,960
cyber security

1035
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,839
um

1036
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,160
they are required not to have

1037
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,880
exclusively technical skills then they

1038
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,400
need to have some soft skills they need

1039
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,480
to have some social skill stations they

1040
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,240
need to have

1041
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,200
a wider range of skills not exclusively

1042
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,760
technical and this is reflected as well

1043
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,560
or shall be reflected in much more

1044
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,119
visible and transparent way at the top

1045
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,440
level of the organization and that means

1046
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,520
function business functions or finance

1047
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,680
or effective higher executive should

1048
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,079
understand more about digital technology

1049
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,040
transformation cyber and everything but

1050
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,040
in the same time of course we we have

1051
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,280
the expectation that everything which

1052
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,440
they can take cyber interests in

1053
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,119
emphasis and and

1054
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,839
the other ones to

1055
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,599
a better understanding the business in

1056
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,720
order to

1057
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,720
ensure that collaboration we were

1058
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,200
discussing earlier

1059
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,879
so that was my point for um

1060
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,160
yeah that's true like we mentioned

1061
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,560
before it takes everyone to do cyber

1062
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,960
security right and you need to just work

1063
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,480
together and

1064
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,200
find a way to communicate without um

1065
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,119
without miscommunication i think that's

1066
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,319
indeed like a huge challenge

1067
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,280
um

1068
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,839
does anyone else have inputs on this

1069
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,319
go ahead jubilee

1070
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,400
ah thank you well definitely i agree

1071
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,119
what we need to to see is uh we need to

1072
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,280
see the the broader

1073
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,720
picture

1074
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,040
actually what we always uh

1075
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,119
need to have in mind is first of all the

1076
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,240
complexity of cyber security itself we

1077
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,599
are all aware that if we compare what is

1078
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,680
seen and uh as cyber security nowadays

1079
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,160
is much different what was seen as cyber

1080
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,880
security area a few years ago and not to

1081
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,880
mention a decade ago

1082
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,599
which means that we all

1083
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,040
we always need to have in mind

1084
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,839
complexity of cyber security itself but

1085
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,960
also its multi dimensionality and it

1086
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,000
gives an opportunity to uh to more women

1087
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,079
to get on board to more women to get on

1088
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,240
stage and cyber security

1089
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,839
because

1090
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,280
there is a plethora of different

1091
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,880
characteristics different threads

1092
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,640
different

1093
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,800
various education

1094
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,119
various expertise which is needed in

1095
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,640
cyber security and once and for all what

1096
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,960
we need is a real i call it a real

1097
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,359
amagum of uh male and female

1098
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,800
characteristics

1099
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,839
as a precondition for complementarity in

1100
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,920
practice which means we need complex

1101
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,359
that amalgam to to get a complementarity

1102
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,480
in practice

1103
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,440
so in that case we all as humanity will

1104
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,480
benefit

1105
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,520
cyber security is actually uh is like a

1106
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,480
putting a jigsaw puzzle together which

1107
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,200
means if you miss one part

1108
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,760
then that you you won't have the whole

1109
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,160
picture and it won't be the picture that

1110
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,040
you're

1111
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,960
trying to to image in front of you

1112
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,280
we all know how annoying it is to build

1113
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,880
a jigsaw puzzle with more than three

1114
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,440
people right

1115
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,000
now but it's true and i think it's not

1116
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,640
only about uh just men and women but

1117
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,960
also just different cultures and teams

1118
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,599
from different um count like

1119
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,440
you you notice that a security team that

1120
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,040
is built of people from different parts

1121
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,040
of the world is just performs better

1122
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,920
because

1123
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,440
they have different experiences if you

1124
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,520
put all the same people in the same

1125
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,280
team they're only going to talk about

1126
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,720
what they've experienced and if they've

1127
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,240
all experienced the same things they

1128
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,560
cannot build the proper threat model

1129
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,240
that actually models the entire planet

1130
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,000
earth so um

1131
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,079
so i think we should indeed have diverse

1132
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,240
teams not only men and women but also

1133
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,359
just uh cultural culturally diverse as

1134
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,720
well

1135
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,640
um

1136
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,640
uh let's see dimitra do you have

1137
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,440
anything to uh to say about this

1138
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,119
oh uh

1139
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,760
i i tend to agree uh i'm part of a

1140
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,520
multicultural cross-continent steam

1141
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,160
and i just tend to gain a lot from it i

1142
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,640
get different inputs so many people with

1143
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,640
different backgrounds

1144
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,839
from different organizations uh coming

1145
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,240
with their own experience and with their

1146
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,720
own input and that can only help an

1147
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
organization grow

1148
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,839
and

1149
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,800
my experience before being here was

1150
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,760
similar

1151
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,480
i think we were

1152
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,400
half of uh

1153
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,480
half of the team was female so

1154
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,319
uh it was an uh

1155
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,040
a new interesting empowering uh way to

1156
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,160
work

1157
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,960
um so yeah i do agree uh having a

1158
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,440
balance uh in both

1159
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,960
i mean yeah having a balance of views

1160
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,400
from different backgrounds different

1161
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,200
cultures different experiences

1162
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,799
do uh do help a lot

1163
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,880
and i think it's evolving in the right

1164
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,040
direction to be honest because there's

1165
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,119
more companies that try to have these

1166
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,200
diversity initiatives and

1167
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,079
they're they're implementing it um in a

1168
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,400
good way i think so i'm i'm positive

1169
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,079
about what it's going to be in the next

1170
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,520
10 years

1171
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,119
um

1172
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,400
and

1173
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,359
be for the last 15 minutes or 10 minutes

1174
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:12,319
even

1175
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,440
um

1176
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,680
what is something you would advise to a

1177
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,640
young security specialist

1178
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,960
regardless if it's a woman or a man or

1179
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,359
um from a different background just uh

1180
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,520
someone who's just starting in the field

1181
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,280
and based on your experience what would

1182
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,079
you advise them

1183
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,520
and um i'll leave the floor to graziella

1184
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,440
yes i know i'm the first one um

1185
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,000
independently if we are talking about uh

1186
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,400
technologies cybersecurity

1187
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,680
men with women um actually i think the

1188
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,160
same thing i would like to want to share

1189
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,680
um if you want is a figure for anybody

1190
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,480
and i would encourage them to

1191
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,680
to try and to be curious

1192
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,520
and this might potentially lead to

1193
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,800
some passion

1194
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,359
they might discover and

1195
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,079
the energy and the enthusiasm and the

1196
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,400
invitation you might have when you feel

1197
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,160
you are passionate and being curious

1198
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,440
about something

1199
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,400
is um cannot be compared with anything

1200
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,440
so um i believe in intuition and i

1201
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,920
believe i don't believe in coincidence

1202
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,720
so

1203
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,559
um most of the things uh i've done it

1204
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,119
was that they were some opportunities

1205
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,680
i've taken at that moment

1206
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,400
um i don't have any regrets and i am i'm

1207
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,359
happy for the the journey i have

1208
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,800
um but i

1209
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,240
when i do not

1210
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,640
feel i am curious and passionate it is

1211
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,800
this a a bell somewhere in my head

1212
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,319
which is ringing

1213
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,640
um and i think it's important

1214
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,839
i would say it's

1215
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,960
as simple as possible

1216
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,839
definitely thank you

1217
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,400
um let me try you have a question in the

1218
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,160
chat actually just relating to the

1219
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,520
previous uh

1220
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,880
statements

1221
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,319
um

1222
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,000
someone in the audience is asking if you

1223
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,280
could tell us how diverse points of view

1224
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,160
uh

1225
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,880
influence threat research or help in

1226
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,240
threat research

1227
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,760
how you've noticed that it helped in

1228
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,839
your team

1229
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,280
and then you can answer the next

1230
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,079
question

1231
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,440
okay

1232
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,079
so um

1233
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,880
coming from different backgrounds uh we

1234
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,440
uh i mean most of the team have had

1235
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,160
really diverse experience uh from

1236
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,559
military organizations from all over the

1237
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,880
world from australia to us to europe

1238
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,880
we

1239
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,280
complement each other's knowledge

1240
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
we each have a piece of the puzzle as

1241
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,640
lubrica said

1242
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,800
and

1243
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,760
the

1244
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,520
more backgrounds

1245
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,240
uh that are working on a profile of an

1246
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,440
adversary or analyzing their behaviors

1247
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,640
um

1248
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,839
the more complete image you get um

1249
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,160
and also it's really important to work

1250
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,000
with opinions that are

1251
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,960
uh

1252
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,440
sometimes in opposition to yours

1253
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,119
um because yeah we we are

1254
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,240
we are all weak to confirmation bias and

1255
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,400
we might look at the things we already

1256
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,839
know and

1257
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,240
we might see things that we want to see

1258
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,880
and then having someone with

1259
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,640
a different point of view a different

1260
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,280
background looking at the same data

1261
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,440
might point out something that you might

1262
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,880
miss or

1263
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,680
make

1264
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,960
may help you

1265
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,839
complement and complete the image of uh

1266
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,480
of the attack

1267
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,800
yeah i think it's also

1268
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,520
oh sorry did someone want to speak or

1269
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,520
yeah i was about to answer the second

1270
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,200
question i'm not sure yeah

1271
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,559
go ahead go ahead

1272
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,280
so yeah uh my advice would be to

1273
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,720
uh trust your dream work hard

1274
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,079
learn

1275
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,160
i don't think i've ever encounter a

1276
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,000
community encountered a community as

1277
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,640
supportive as infosec community you can

1278
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,160
literally reach out to anyone on

1279
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,839
linkedin on twitter

1280
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,640
ask for help ask for guidance

1281
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,839
i've received books i've landed books

1282
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,160
courses

1283
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,880
gave out advice

1284
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,559
if you want to do it you can do it and i

1285
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,760
think i'm a proof of that

1286
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,599
yeah definitely um educate yourself it's

1287
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,480
not

1288
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,240
uh to just go back to your point about

1289
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,040
the culturally um diverse teams when i

1290
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,119
was doing threat research and just

1291
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,880
looking at ransomware messages from

1292
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,720
threat actors the way they write a mess

1293
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,200
when somewhere message you can sort of

1294
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,119
know where they're from because if they

1295
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,040
forget the articles they're probably

1296
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,760
eastern european or these kind of things

1297
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,160
so uh yeah that's why it's also in the

1298
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,400
language um phases

1299
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,839
but um

1300
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,079
nubika what do you what do you would you

1301
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,800
tell someone who's a complete newbie in

1302
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,640
cyber security

1303
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,200
uh well uh

1304
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,920
after uh during one interview i was

1305
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,880
asked how do i feel as a woman in an

1306
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,520
environment which is predominantly male

1307
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,319
i

1308
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,640
uh answered the question with the smile

1309
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,119
on my face on my face and i still feel

1310
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,280
it that way i answer

1311
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,240
i reply i am i feel as a strong

1312
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,640
strawberry on the top of the cream

1313
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,960
which means and i always use it as a

1314
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,960
kind of inspiration to all other young

1315
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,440
girls and young women who want to join

1316
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,640
uh just to be themselves uh i i always

1317
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,480
try to explain that what we need

1318
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,800
actually is different approach the

1319
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,280
different characteristics the different

1320
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,359
uh way how

1321
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,400
women in cyber security react and

1322
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,240
get decisions

1323
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,559
get decisions when it comes to some

1324
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,200
problems or when they need to

1325
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,920
to offer to recommend something we don't

1326
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,440
need to imitate in a way

1327
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,640
the way how men approach uh how many uh

1328
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,680
men decide when it comes to uh different

1329
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,240
kind of cyber security risks threats or

1330
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,880
situations actually as i said i will

1331
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,880
come back to what i said previously and

1332
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,240
we i i'm sure and i think that we all

1333
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,480
during our discussion we all confirmed

1334
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,599
that that what we need is the

1335
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,680
complementarity to see the

1336
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,079
multi-dimensionality to see the

1337
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,040
complementarity to try to get on the

1338
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,599
stage what we as women have

1339
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,079
and uh and uh

1340
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,440
to try first of all uh uh

1341
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,599
on on one side to

1342
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:48,480
to

1343
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,119
provoke changes in the mentality in the

1344
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,920
country to prove changes in the culture

1345
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,640
how the society is

1346
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,559
seeing the things when it comes to cyber

1347
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,720
security and especially to work with

1348
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,319
companies because

1349
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,040
having in mind that companies are profit

1350
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,280
oriented and they are uh

1351
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,680
the entities they are the link

1352
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,839
which is making the most money and we we

1353
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,079
all know uh although we don't want to

1354
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,520
admit uh publicly that the money is is

1355
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,720
driving the uh is driving the world so

1356
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,359
uh that's why what we need is also to

1357
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,520
work on several levels

1358
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,240
first of all to work with societies uh

1359
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,359
to to change the perception of cyber

1360
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,319
security to educate to give the

1361
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,880
opportunities for each girl and women to

1362
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,280
see what it really means to offer them a

1363
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,839
real chance what it means

1364
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:45,760
to be involved in cyber security so as

1365
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,559
all previous speakers already said what

1366
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,440
we need is a motivation it's a kind of

1367
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,400
um

1368
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,040
honest approach to ourselves and of

1369
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,280
course we need an inspiration and help

1370
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,640
coming from others so we are all here

1371
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,720
actually discussing about that how to to

1372
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,400
be an inspiration

1373
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,960
uh because i always when i try to

1374
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,160
inspire some girl uh during a mentorship

1375
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,079
program i'm also

1376
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,480
i think i'm even more inspired than the

1377
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,119
girl of the girl because it's a way how

1378
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,280
you get the energy and how you give the

1379
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,480
positive energy back

1380
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,640
actually on um on what she said uh

1381
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,200
there's a question in the audience about

1382
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,280
um and that's for everybody in this

1383
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,400
panel and then i'll get to you andretta

1384
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,359
um what will be concrete steps you have

1385
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,040
taken in order to ensure the fair

1386
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,920
participation of women in the workforce

1387
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,400
for example maternity leave or the bias

1388
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,799
in hiring and promoting have you taken

1389
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,440
these steps in your jobs to ensure that

1390
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,680
it gets better and what were those

1391
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,160
concrete steps

1392
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,720
i think you can start lubricant

1393
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,440
well we as an organization women for

1394
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,240
cyber we are working on different levels

1395
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,720
and activities concretely right now in

1396
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,599
north macedonia here we are working uh

1397
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,799
and uh

1398
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,599
we already succeeded actually to uh to

1399
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,000
to get women on board when it comes to

1400
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
building cybersecurity strategy in the

1401
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,520
country to make them very active very

1402
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,400
active

1403
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,559
in that spirit and also we work on not

1404
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,400
only

1405
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,599
on legislation measures and legislation

1406
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,079
texts and laws in the country

1407
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,280
to get to promote women uh possibilities

1408
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,400
to get in cyber security but actually uh

1409
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,760
when it uh

1410
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,839
uh i will mention just one of the

1411
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,319
measures uh which is uh which was uh

1412
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,400
which find it out it was very important

1413
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,559
during the pandemic time

1414
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,400
because we all know that the pandemic

1415
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,680
had a lot of negative consequences

1416
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,400
but

1417
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,280
also for men and women but for women

1418
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,880
they were even higher the negative

1419
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,040
consequences of the pandemic were even

1420
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,480
higher for women

1421
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,240
so uh we

1422
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,160
we get

1423
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,040
our success was that

1424
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,200
working with our government we get a

1425
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,319
position when one of the measures uh

1426
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,839
helping women to overcome uh

1427
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,319
to overcome the situation with uh with

1428
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,559
the pandemics uh when it comes to cyber

1429
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,680
security area uh to get uh

1430
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,280
more funds and to get together a special

1431

fund which is dedicated to women in

1432
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,680
cyber security and actually how to

1433
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,119
support them as freelancers and as

1434
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,839

00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,280
from my position of being president of

too much in implementing them in romania

1459

we need more energy in the collaborative

1461
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,720
part or in the collaboration part we

1462

1477
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,960
there are corporations where um some

1478
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,359
initiatives has been started uh because

1479
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,520
this is the trend in the same same time

1480
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,920
in in the society um and uh um we've run

1481

some workshops uh trying to better

1482
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,400
understand the

1483
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,599
challenges and the needs of

and uh from different perspectives from

1486
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,960
the founders on the issues of being

1487
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,760
professional from the sense of being

1488
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,559
a mother for the truth of being planning

1489
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,960
to be a mother and

1490
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,440
did the scope of the entire workshop for

1491
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,160
voice to put together some

1492
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,720
um ideas and try to implement them

1493
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,520
through um hr function of course without

1494
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,119
it we can't do anything in our

1495
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,280
preparations

1496
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,720
but it was a nice start for uh for this

1497
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,240
inclusion

1498
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,919
initiative at the corporate level

1499
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,160
yeah um

1500
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,200
just to to continue that idea i work for

1501
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,760
a radio station in in bucharest which is

1502
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,640
a like general audience radio station

1503
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,119
it's called pro fm and one of the things

1504
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,760
that i'm doing is to try to

1505
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,240
involve my male colleagues into talking

1506
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,480
about issues that are normally applied

1507
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,680
to women so i do have one colleague in

1508
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,880
the newsroom and every piece of news

1509
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,599
that is connected with uh

1510
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,039
women's rights is assigned to him

1511
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,319
and i told him george it's one thing if

1512
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,440
i

1513
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,839
go live and talk about breastfeeding in

1514
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,559
public places and another thing if you

1515
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,960
go there and you do that

1516
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,000
because um we need to partner with men

1517
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,799
and we need to have a few of them to

1518
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:35,039
advocate for for our rights um and just

1519
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,760
by watching this computer screen right

1520
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,480
now and and looking at our faces i i

1521
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,280
realized that we are five successful

1522
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,160
women and maybe a lot more in the

1523
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,559
audience were quite accomplished

1524
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,200
um we've done great things um

1525
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,000
independently or or together but i'm

1526
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,400
thinking that for for every person here

1527
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,720
in this panel there are thousands

1528
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,359
of women who have never had the chance

1529
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,960
to to be here or or to have an education

1530
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,400
in in stem

1531
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,039
maybe many of them have been discouraged

1532
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,520
throughout this life their lives maybe

1533
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,680
they were told that you're not smart

1534
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,000
enough to learn math or or computer

1535
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,880
science and this is also a thing we

1536
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,359
should tackle and and be

1537
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,599
um supportive

1538
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,400
and donate our time and resources to to

1539
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,520
help the new generation um and perhaps

1540
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,319
this is a way of of tackling this

1541
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:35,440
um and another point and i promise this

1542
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,160
is the last one i think we should um

1543
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,039
involve women in in every possible way

1544
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,240
um and men and make women part of of

1545
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,359
designing security products of um

1546
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,440
helping supporting each other um get a

1547
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,480
management position that would impact um

1548
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,520
all of us and and everyone who's doing a

1549
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,480
good work within the the community and

1550
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,160
hopefully um during the following um

1551
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,119
editions of deaf camp we'll have more

1552
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,480
fantastic women in in the audience and

1553
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,359
um

1554
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,640
it is super important to grow together

1555
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,280
and have like a great vibe throughout

1556
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,559
the the community

1557
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,440
definitely i think you raise a really

1558
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,520
good point here that this we shouldn't

1559
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,240
eliminate women from men it's it's we're

1560
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,760
all in this together right we're all in

1561
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,359
this world together we should work

1562
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:30,880
together and

1563
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,720
and um make this a good place for

1564
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,359
everyone uh regardless of gender or

1565
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:37,119
culture or anything

1566
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,680
um and i'm gonna give the final word to

1567
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,119
dimitra

1568
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,160
um

1569
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,920
and then we'll wrap up this panel i

1570
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,760
think if you have anything else to add

1571
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,880
about the last question uh yeah my role

1572
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,160
doesn't have too much input in uh

1573
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,799
in decision making but what i can say

1574
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,720
from my experience is that

1575
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,839
i was fortunate enough uh to not

1576
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,760
experience any gatekeeping

1577
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,680
or any disadvantage for being a woman in

1578
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,119
cyber security

1579
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,559
and

1580
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,319
what i would

1581
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,960
like to see more is

1582
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,400
women to just have

1583
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,240
more trust in themselves and in their

1584
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,240
technical capabilities and apply for

1585
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,440
that job it is for you as well

1586
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,280
so we currently have an opening in the

1587
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,079
team

1588
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,280
uh and i'm pretty sure no women applied

1589
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,760
so far so please do so

1590
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,760
if if you like threat hunting and cyber

1591
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,880
security

1592
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,440
um and you'd like to do this job please

1593
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,839
apply

1594
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,079
yeah and hunting is great

1595
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,520
um

1596
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,200
yeah so i think this brings us to the

1597
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,119
end of our panel there is one more

1598
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,720
question in the audience

1599
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,880
i don't know andre andrada if we have

1600
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,839
time for this last question if we keep

1601
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,480
it short you can do sure go ahead

1602
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,280
um

1603
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,039
how do you think women can receive more

1604
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,400
respect when they are in a management

1605
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,960
position in the cybersecurity field

1606
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,440
um it's a tough question so if you can

1607
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,520
answer this if any anyone can answer

1608
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,839
this in one sentence i will

1609
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,558
worship you

1610
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,319
i can say

1611
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:17,599
i don't

1612
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:18,880
i haven't

1613
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,799
experienced

1614
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,640
situations where uh lack of respect um

1615
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,240
was on the table

1616
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,200
so

1617
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,440
maybe we have had uh

1618
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,319
let's see challenges in in discussions

1619
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,280
different point of view conflicts but i

1620
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,119
would take them as a professional

1621
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,000
conflicts not personal one but maybe i'm

1622
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,440
fortunate and

1623
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,480
i haven't experienced such and hopefully

1624
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,640
you i i wish you

1625
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,480
cannot experience such situations

1626
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,799
one thing if i could add would be to

1627
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,839
build alliances because there are um

1628
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,000
many people that would support you if

1629
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,799
you're good at what you do and they

1630
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:03,839
already

1631
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,960
respect you and you can also help create

1632
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,680
a culture that respects everyone if

1633
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,480
you're on a management position and also

1634
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,039
approach journalists

1635
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,000
and

1636
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,200
talk to them about your work

1637
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,480
and raise your profile

1638
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,119
i think also the at least from the

1639
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,920
accounts that i have heard it was not

1640
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,240
uh disrespect from manager to her um

1641
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,839
employees but more with other managers

1642
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,319
uh that are let's say mostly men and

1643
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,720
then she's a manager and they don't take

1644
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,000
her seriously

1645
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and i think this is this is indeed

1646
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,640
linked to company culture this is just a

1647
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,200
a culture problem and not a

1648
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,039
problem at this small island let's say

1649
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:56,400
um

1650
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,880
so you really need to to

1651
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,039
i mean try to figure out if your

1652
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,799
employees are uh respectful because oh

1653
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,039
they all look like this person or they

1654
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,960
are respectful in general of everybody

1655
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,920
but this is this is a very difficult uh

1656
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,920
screening you have to psychologically

1657
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,839
profile everyone and see if they could

1658
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,479
fit in your culture but like yeah

1659
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,319
i do think that if you notice that

1660
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,520
there's a culture misfit like another

1661
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:24,960
fit for the culture that you need to

1662
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,399
take action at least um instead of

1663
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,238
letting it slide if you have such

1664
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,520
incidents of disrespect towards anyone

1665
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,759
you you need to tackle it you don't let

1666
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,839
it slide because otherwise it's going to

1667
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,319
stay and it might inspire others to um

1668
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,400
to also be distributed disrespectful

1669
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,198
that's it's hard to

1670
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:48,000
uh

1671
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,080
it's hard to prevent but easy to detect

1672
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,839
i think that's uh that's something

1673
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,040
um

1674
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,839
if anyone has anything else to add then

1675
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,679
um

1676
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,799
i guess we can wrap up

1677
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,160
um

1678
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,238
[Music]

1679
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,560
then thank you everyone we were i think

1680
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,040
we were a bit late 10 minutes later but

1681
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,799
uh that happens all the time in

1682
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,640
conferences so

1683

human error fixing let's say because i

1694
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,520
think that's the conclusion of this

1695
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,359
panel it's not about the technical

1696
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,040
challenges it's more a social challenge
