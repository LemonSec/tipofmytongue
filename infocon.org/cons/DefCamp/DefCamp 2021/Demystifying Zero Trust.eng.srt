1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,439
um after such a year of uh missing

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,200
public gatherings and missing being

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,400
together we really are lucky to be

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,960
together in this virtual environment it

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,599
is virtual it's not a in-person meeting

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,679
but it's definitely more than nothing

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,400
and i think it does us a great dose of

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,960
good to reconnect to talk to each other

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
and to listen to the experience that

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,240
other professionals have had during

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,160
these past years

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,240
and speaking about the context of the

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,480
pandemic and what it has forced us to

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,360
learn and forced us to adapt to

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,840
i would like to segue into the subject

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,879
of the the next presentation

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,559
so i think you've noticed that during

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,640
the past two years organizations have

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,440
taken on the difficult task of migrating

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,879
to remote work

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,200
which means that protecting the people

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,160
the apps and the devices have totally

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
escaped the physical boundary of the

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,550
office

25
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,120
[Music]

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,680
who is a microsoft mvp and a certified

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,480
ethical hacker will demystify zero trust

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
architectures from us from from how they

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,520
work to how they can be implemented and

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
i think this is even more important

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,240
right now when zero trust could be one

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
of the best answers that we have to

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,119
securing our assets inside organizations

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,600
and securing our both our public and our

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
private lives todor i entrust the

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,240
microphone to you

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,200
hello again to to everyone

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
i did um

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
i did briefly touch on this subject

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,479
during uh the panel earlier this morning

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,840
so

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,159
for those of you who've been uh a part

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,920
of that this is just a continuation of

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
of the discussion around zero trust that

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,680
we had there

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,079
and um

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
without further ado let's let's get

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,280
straight to it we don't have

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,520
nearly enough time to to talk about

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,880
everything that zero trust is and what

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,079
um how it can help us but i'll try to at

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,360
least

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,479
give you a

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,479
better overview of what it means

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,599
so a little bit about me my background

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,760
is in cyber security and

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,440
infrastructure

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,120
i've been

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,040
working with customers all over the

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
world for the past 15 plus years

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,780
doing a lot of

62
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,640
[Music]

63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,879
like migrations to the cloud in recent

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,360
years helping customers better secure

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
their infrastructures and their

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,560
applications

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,480
um ensuring uh the the training and the

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,959
awareness of security throughout

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
organizations and things like that so

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,840
i've been

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,200
um

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,760
i've been encountering a lot of

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,599
the issues that have arisen over the

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,720
years uh in the cyber security world

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,959
uh from different perspectives talking

76
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,920
to the people that actually face them

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
and talking to the

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,800
um

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,080
uh the the people who were supposed to

80
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,640
be managing or preventing those things

81
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,879
uh discovering these things inside

82
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,800
companies and um

83
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
um everything in between

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
so enough about me let's look at

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,599
the the structure of the agenda for um

86
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,680
for my session today

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,400
first off we will look at what zero

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,519
trust is

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,400
and then we'll try and briefly touch on

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,480
um some

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,680
subjects like why should i do it and how

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
do i tell whether this is the right

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
solution for me

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,400
and then

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,319
figuring out how to do it and

96
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,560
how do you pick the best solutions out

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
there and what you you should be looking

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,519
for

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,120
uh we'll uh

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,360
we'll touching we'll be touching briefly

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
on on the maturity model

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,319
there's a couple of examples that i'll

103
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,280
be giving there and we'll have a wrap up

104
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
of the whole thing and

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,439
we'll try to figure out the next steps

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,120
together um

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,400
i'll also

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,879
try to leave some room for any questions

109
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,080
uh towards the end hopefully there's

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,478
enough time for that left

111
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,680
so um looking at zero trust itself now

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
now

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
not only because of the pandemic but

114
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,360
that really contributed to that to the

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,479
whole thing

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,720
um there's two

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
recent trends in cyber security that um

118
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,160
are more more noticeable in recent years

119
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,120
one

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,000
is the whole shift to remote work and

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
working from home and yes the pandemic

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,639
definitely contributed to that

123
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,150
um

124
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,400
[Music]

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,440
it's it's clear that a lot of companies

126
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,320
already have that or working towards

127
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
hybrid workspace and like the slide says

128
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,000
remote work has kind of become the new

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,080
signing bonus and i've seen

130
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,680
uh and talked to people in hr that have

131
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
have reported

132
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,720
people coming into interviews and asking

133
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,880
a different

134
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
pay

135
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,600
for a work from home

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
model and a do you want me to come into

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the office everyday model because that's

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,759
going to cost you extra because that's

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,680
gonna make me

140
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
waste time commuting and things like

141
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
that so it's it's becoming more and more

142
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
common

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,560
and that's um

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
that's one uh one of the trends

145
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
um

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,479
for the companies that actually do this

147
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,639
a lot of them do have security concerns

148
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,320
there's a study that was published in

149
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,840
the wall street journal that showed that

150
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,240
around 94 of companies actually have

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,039
these uh concerns you can see them

152
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
somewhere on the on the right side of

153
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,600
the slide concerns around employees

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,240
downloading unsafe apps on their um

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,479
on their computers and devices on

156
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,240
ransomware attacks and phishing attacks

157
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,440
and so on

158
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,840
then there's another trend

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,280
that may not be as visible to the the

160
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,840
regular users which is the the

161
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,440
increasing number of attacks by

162
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
state-sponsored actors

163
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,560
um

164
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,360
attacks targeting supply chains attacks

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,319
targeting large-scale infrastructures

166
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,440
and msps and things like that which uh

167
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,440
does tend to to shift the focus uh in

168
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,240
the cyber security world uh quite a bit

169
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,919
so that's that's really important to

170
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,840
keep in mind because

171
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
zero trust does provide some solutions

172
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,199
to to both of these things

173
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,759
um then there's the

174
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,560
the

175
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,560
shift in mindset that unfortunately not

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
a lot of people and not a lot of

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,800
companies have been able to to do

178
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,360
and how we deal with things and how we

179
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,520
look at things

180
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,160
back in the day the expectation was that

181
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
all the users you have in your system

182
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,960
are your employees nowadays that's no

183
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,199
longer the case you might find that your

184
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,919
partners and customers have a user in

185
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,080
your system in your

186
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,000
active directory or azure active

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,720
directory for instance if you use say

188
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,520
microsoft 365 or office 365.

189
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,199
um

190
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,919
back a few years ago if you if we just

191
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,639
look at five ten years ago

192
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,720
uh there were a lot more corporate

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,440
devices being used as compared to the

194
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
bring your own device policies that

195
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,840
allow people to use their own

196
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,319
personal phones to access company emails

197
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,840
and company data

198
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
this has been a clear trend in recent

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
years and nowadays

200
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
it's quite common for people to use

201
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,520
their own devices uh to access company

202
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,440
and they expect to be able to access

203
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,080
company data from wherever whenever they

204
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
need to um

205
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,440
so that's that's part of the the

206
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,840
discussion

207
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,400
um years back most applications were on

208
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,479
premise now

209
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,560
everything has been moving to the cloud

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,639
and everything is now in the cloud so

211
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,199
you expect to be able to connect to that

212
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,879
app from wherever

213
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,759
but you still want to secure that as to

214
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,039
the best of your uh abilities um

215
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,039
before the pandemic and that's an

216
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,319
obvious change uh happening in um

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,960
in the past year and a half or so

218
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,240
work was thought to be done at work now

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,120
work

220
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,440
needs to be done anywhere and a lot of

221
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,839
companies only survive because they were

222
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,839
able to accommodate this

223
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,320
uh the ones that weren't able to and

224
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,479
they said no we you need to come into

225
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,679
the office to do your job even if it was

226
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,000
possible because there's certainly cases

227
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
where

228
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,240
certain jobs cannot be done without your

229
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,320
physical presence but in some cases

230
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
where that can be done and the companies

231
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,560
have refused to do it

232
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,519
um those companies have had a lot of uh

233
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,000
of things to lose because of that and

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
employees just

235
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,000
left and started working for some other

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,920
company that allowed them that work from

237
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,839
home policy

238
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,600
and like i mentioned on the previous

239
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,959
slide

240
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,800
criminal syndicates have started

241
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,680
shifting to nation-state actors so this

242
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,320
is the the reality we now face and this

243
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,480
is quite important to to keep in mind

244
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
because it's

245
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,640
uh it's also very relevant to to our

246
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
discussion now why are we having this

247
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
zero trust conversation uh we're trying

248
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,279
in essence if we're doing security of

249
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,680
right or we we think we're doing

250
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
security right what we're trying to do

251
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
is we're trying to keep our assets away

252
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,880
from the bad guys from the attackers now

253
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,640
the problem is i.t security is quite

254
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
complex we have many devices many users

255
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
many connections happening at the same

256
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,320
time and

257
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,839
up until

258
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,800
10 years ago let's say the trusted

259
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,680
network security strategy used to work

260
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,399
where any attacks were

261
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,880
usually network-based you would just

262
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
need to better protect your

263
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
infrastructure and your applications and

264
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,279
your data center

265
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,160
but

266
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,279
you could do it in a very confined space

267
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
and a very well-defined space this is

268
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,000
the hq this is the server i can i can

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
touch it it's

270
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
right here i can see the blinky lights

271
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
on all my network equipment

272
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,839
this is no longer the case in a cloud

273
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,279
first world

274
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,040
and

275
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,519
back then it was common to accept a

276
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,360
lower security of risk within the

277
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,680
network and just try to protect the edge

278
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,079
try to protect that

279
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,800
that link to the outside now as assets

280
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
increasingly leave the network with the

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,279
bring your own device or

282
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,040
as some might call it bring your own

283
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,920
disaster policies with working from home

284
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,640
with mobile being

285
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
everywhere with software as a service

286
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
solutions

287
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,120
this has changed and

288
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
there's another change where attackers

289
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,240
now started to shift to identity attacks

290
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,640
as compared to network-based attacks as

291
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
they used to do in the past

292
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
it's it's easy for them to just try and

293
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,760
compromise the credentials of one user

294
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,560
and launch essentially an attack

295
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
from that user's

296
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,920
point or from that user's uh level of

297
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,880
access so essentially attacks originate

298
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,560
from inside the network

299
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
because they originate from an account

300
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,959
that was compromised rather that than a

301
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,800
firewall or a network device that was

302
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,760
compromised and it's much easier for

303
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,720
for attackers to get in this way and

304
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,240
most attacks uh start this way

305
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
it's all about uh phishing and

306
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,880
credential theft and it's it's harder to

307
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,040
protect against those types of attacks

308
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,639
as well

309
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,279
so what is zero trust um

310
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,079
the the fancy definition tries to tell

311
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,880
you about the set of concepts and ideas

312
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,040
uh that are designed to minimize

313
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,639
uncertainty and to enforce um

314
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,279
least privilege access decisions per

315
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,480
request essentially trying to let you

316
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,800
figure out whether

317
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
not just anyone should have access to

318
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,760
anything but should this user be able to

319
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,560
access this server or this application

320
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,279
in this context from that device from

321
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
that geographical location at that point

322
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,920
in time so you're looking at a more

323
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,639
granular granular way of

324
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,440
of

325
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,959
determining and allowing access and

326
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,279
setting restrictions in place

327
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,279
and there's a lot of frameworks out

328
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,680
there trying to help companies better

329
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,920
define and better understand this kind

330
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,519
of

331
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,240
this kind of approach

332
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,519
i think the

333
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,839
the reality nowadays

334
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,880
is in very many ways similar to what big

335
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,120
data used to be to what the cloud used

336
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
to be when they first showed up and

337
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
there's a great quote um you have it on

338
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,480
the screen

339
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
from back in 2013 and it was about big

340
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,519
data at the time

341
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,680
then i've started seeing this about the

342
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,000
cloud i think it applies to zero trust

343
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
and it says like this zero trust is like

344
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,360
teenage sex everyone talks about it

345
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,279
nobody really knows how to do it

346
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,200
everyone thinks everyone else is doing

347
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,920
it so everyone claims they are doing it

348
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,600
and i think this

349
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
today this describes the state on the

350
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
industry quite well

351
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,079
there's some awareness there's some

352
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,800
companies that have started to do

353
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,519
zero trust to implement zero trust

354
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,760
uh but most of them

355
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,079
are just trying to are still trying to

356
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,079
figure out what this is all about and

357
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,639
how this applies to what they used to do

358
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,199
up until yesterday and how these changes

359
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,639
and these new trends and these new

360
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
technologies also change the way they do

361
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,639
business

362
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,760
uh

363
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,199
essentially

364
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,600
if you want to distill zero trust to

365
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,440
like three bullet points

366
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,839
uh this would be it it's

367
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,279
uh any zero trust approach is all about

368
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,839
first verifying everything explicitly

369
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,320
and this means you have to find ways and

370
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,240
solutions and processes that allow you

371
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,399
to use all the data points you look at

372
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,040
the user's identity the location the

373
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
health of the device is the device up to

374
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,360
date does the device have any sort of

375
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
anti-malware anti-virus on it and does

376
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,519
it report a healthy state

377
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
what sort of service or workload is that

378
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,639
user or device trying to access

379
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,440
am i using data classification am i am i

380
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,160
searching for any sort of anomalies like

381
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,800
is this user that usually comes into the

382
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,680
office works nine to five and works on

383
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,560
those three excel spreadsheets that sit

384
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,279
on a server or a cloud chair somewhere

385
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,399
all of a sudden connect on a saturday at

386
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,720
2 a.m from russia

387
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,880
trying to access

388
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
tens of thousands of documents across

389
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,440
the company is that something that that

390
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,079
user would do or is that an anomaly that

391
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,519
should be flagged that should be

392
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,920
reported that should be acted upon in an

393
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,760
automated fashion and how can i tell do

394
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
i have the the tools the solutions in

395
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,600
place to to tell that this is happening

396
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,160
the second point here is to try and use

397
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,360
a least privileged access approach uh

398
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,680
just in time and just enough access

399
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,000
things like risk-based adaptive policies

400
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,800
making sure that you only give

401
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,680
a particular user the specific

402
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,240
privileges that the user requires to do

403
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
their job for the specific amount of

404
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,240
time it takes them to do that job in and

405
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,920
then you revoke those privileges you

406
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
don't leave

407
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,800
admin accounts running around everywhere

408
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
if you don't need them

409
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,880
and then there's the assume breach

410
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
approach which is

411
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,279
um the the third component but not the

412
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,040
least important

413
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
it's more of an approach that makes you

414
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,199
think about um

415
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,199
not how to prevent

416
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,360
getting hacked but how to detect if

417
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,480
you've already got hacked for instance

418
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,040
looking at uh segmented access looking

419
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,519
at new ways to use encryption analytics

420
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,880
and threat detection and things like

421
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,839
that

422
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,839
uh the point i am trying to make here

423
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,079
however is that traditional castle

424
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,399
remote security is dead

425
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,880
that's no longer the case

426
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,800
and if you're still using that kind of

427
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
an approach

428
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
you are probably

429
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,199
exposing yourself to a lot of risk

430
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,600
now when it comes to and just looking at

431
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,800
uh at these three things uh in in

432
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,839
sequence

433
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,399
at when it comes to identities uh make

434
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,959
sure that by identities you understand

435
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
that i'm referring to both human and

436
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,279
workload identities more and more

437
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,199
applications and solutions out there are

438
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,639
deployed using database and i know

439
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,800
application pool credentials those are

440
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,600
not users but they're still identities

441
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,240
that need to be protected if that login

442
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,359
or that particular account

443
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,240
that the the workload is running under

444
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
is compromised the entire application is

445
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,400
compromised so whenever you look at

446
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,640
these identities you need to look at the

447
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,799
groups and the roles they they're part

448
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,039
of at the location they're connecting

449
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,959
from and the privileges they have and

450
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,079
should have and that at the risk that

451
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,799
any sort of variation in those other

452
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,760
things

453
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,640
uh cause or could cause to your to your

454
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,559
company so looking at strong

455
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,919
authentication passwordless technology

456
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,720
things like mfa and fido keys and

457
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,160
biometrics and passwordless uh in

458
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,039
general uh could could be a potential

459
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,120
part of the solution here

460
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,360
verifying all your devices is also

461
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
important uh looking at all the managed

462
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,880
endpoints or

463
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
personal byod devices and that their

464
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,000
health and compliance the type and os

465
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
version that they're running the

466
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,559
encryption status and also the risk that

467
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,960
any sort of compromised device of that

468
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,400
kind would uh would expose you to

469
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,200
so this is this is all about the devices

470
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
the least privileged part that i've

471
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,400
mentioned

472
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
is important to understand

473
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,919
from the perspective and there's a

474
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,919
really simple graph from the perspective

475
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,240
of how traditional i.t

476
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
is

477
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,559
mostly done

478
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,120
in time there's a trend that the

479
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,919
permissions that are granted to users

480
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,600
are significantly more than the

481
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
permissions that are actually used or

482
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,840
needed at any given time you might have

483
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,480
needed to change something on your dns

484
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,559
server six months ago

485
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,799
so you are granted permissions to do so

486
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,799
if those permissions are still in place

487
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,600
that means you've your user has had

488
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,840
those permissions for six months and not

489
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,320
used them and this applies to to a lot

490
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,120
of um a lot of points as you as you

491
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
might suspect uh that gap between the

492
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,120
permissions granted and the permissions

493
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,679
that are actually used or needed is the

494
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,679
amount of risk you're exposing yourself

495
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,160
to in case that particular account your

496
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,840
account for instance gets compromised

497
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,640
right

498
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,039
uh and it's important to to use that

499
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,960
that least privilege um approach and

500
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,120
also when looking at identities you need

501
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,160
governance and it's it might be

502
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,200
different

503
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
if you look from from the the type of

504
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,559
workload and the type of identity

505
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,799
but both user identities and oracle

506
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,799
identities go through very specific

507
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,720
cycles and you need to be able to

508
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,960
control and have insight into all those

509
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,840
cycles when it comes to users users come

510
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
on board they get hired they they get

511
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,320
the access they need they might change

512
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
the position or job or they might leave

513
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
the company so those permissions might

514
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,400
need to be revoked it's similar with a

515
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
workload identity for an application

516
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
that comes from like a dev or staging

517
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,440
environment goes into production under

518
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,880
specific rights and permissions and then

519
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,440
it may be moved or decommissioned so it

520
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,360
kind of goes through similar

521
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,880
cycles

522
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
and you need to understand both of these

523
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,679
cycles in order to better protect those

524
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,000
data governance is also important from

525
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,159
discovering and classifying and labeling

526
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,880
your your data applying policies to

527
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,360
protect the documents and

528
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,039
emails and everything around your

529
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,720
company

530
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,559
implementing data loss prevention and

531
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,200
encryption and conditional access

532
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,640
solutions

533
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,039
and monitoring to ensure that these

534
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,200
things that you want in place are

535
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
actually in place and behaving as

536
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,520
expected so this applies to

537
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
uh detecting sensitive information

538
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,240
things just look at gdpr and the the

539
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,960
shift the major shift it had around data

540
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,679
privacy in the industry

541
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,080
looking at ways to better detect the

542
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
types of data you

543
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,159
uh you collect you process and you store

544
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,480
and why you do it and who has access to

545
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,039
it and where that does that data go and

546
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,480
who gets uh gets to see it or or

547
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
or change it in the end

548
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,159
and also when it comes to just regular

549
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,159
basic attacks

550
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,120
this unfortunately is a trend that isn't

551
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,520
stopping in the industry it's been like

552
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,000
this for for years now

553
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
uh when you look at the regular attack

554
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,799
and the the the timeline of that attack

555
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,919
uh most of that time for for the for the

556
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,480
bad guys uh usually goes into the

557
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,559
research and preparation phase

558
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,240
if if you do your job well in this phase

559
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,440
the rest is really easy so once you've

560
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
done your research and you you

561
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,679
compromised your first host it usually

562
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,120
takes anywhere between 24 to 48 hours to

563
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
get from a regular user account through

564
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,039
privilege escalation through lateral

565
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,200
movement through all of the techniques

566
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,799
and stuff that you

567
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,120
probably already heard of or will hear

568
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,080
of during the talks at dev camp this

569
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,440
year

570
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,039
there's ways for you to get to

571
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,360
owning everything like the domain admin

572
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,919
level and the average in the industry is

573
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,400
24 to 48 hours from the initial host

574
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
being compromised

575
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,880
now the

576
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,039
the worrying part

577
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,320
is the last part it takes anywhere

578
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,720
between six to nine months

579
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,559
for those attacks to be actually

580
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,960
detected and this is where the problem

581
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,600
lies imagine right now

582
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,280
a hacker

583
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,760
sitting on your network and having been

584
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
there for the past six months with

585
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,480
access to everything to your data to

586
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,440
your databases to all your files to the

587
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,760
source code of all your applications

588
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,600
what could they do and what could they

589
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,400
have done in during all this time

590
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,799
this only refers to attacks that have

591
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,000
been detected if the if the hacker is

592
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,480
really really good you don't even know

593
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,520
they were there they they get in they

594
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,840
get what they want they change what they

595
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,120
want they leave no trace for you to

596
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
determine that they were even there

597
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,200
that's

598
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,240
the reality that's the average and while

599
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
it may vary from industry to industry

600
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,960
it's not that one case where a major

601
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,720
i don't know cloud provider or a major

602
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,559
software as a service provider out there

603
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,000
was hacked

604
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,240
there's some there's too many of them to

605
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,559
even count in recent years

606
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,480
with this reality in mind this is where

607
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
the assumed breach approach comes in

608
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
this is why this is important

609
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,240
asking yourself

610
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,559
what if i've already been hacked how

611
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,840
could i tell

612
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,480
like monitor everything that goes on on

613
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,159
your network look for indicators of

614
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,799
compromise look for indicators of attack

615
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,640
uh maybe use machine learning and ai

616
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
even those solutions still need to adapt

617
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
and devolve and look at modern attacks

618
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,159
like token theft and forged small tokens

619
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,760
and workload identity attacks and things

620
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
like that but unless you're already

621
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,720
thinking about how can i better do my

622
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,039
job here how can i better prevent this

623
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,679
you're you're probably already at risk

624
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,559
and then there comes a discussion about

625
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,799
uh the possibility of doing automated

626
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,039
mitigation and remediation

627
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,080
there's if you search for soar solutions

628
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,320
which stands for security orchestration

629
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,880
automation and response

630
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,480
those are platforms that not only detect

631
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,760
bad things going on but they also try to

632
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,279
either remediate or automate a response

633
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,840
before you can even get to work because

634
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,760
if you detect an attack on a saturday at

635
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,640
2 am and you only block that user on

636
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,679
monday at 9 00 a.m when your it guys log

637
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,440
in to work

638
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,840
that may already be too late so you need

639
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,080
to have these kinds of responses as

640
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,760
automated as possible

641
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,320
with as little human interaction in the

642
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,080
response chain

643
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,960
and once you do that you you'll be

644
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,880
better protected

645
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,400
if we are to just take a

646
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,799
an overview look a deep breath and just

647
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,000
sit back this is what zero trust would

648
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
look

649
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
you have your zero trust policy in the

650
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,679
very middle and you need to look at both

651
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,919
identities and endpoints or devices

652
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,520
whether they're corporate or personal

653
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,880
ensure that

654
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,760
identities human and workload identities

655
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,520
have strong authentication ensure the

656
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,440
devices that connect go through some

657
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,679
compliance requests

658
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,520
and then on the right side you need to

659
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,240
ensure that your data is classified

660
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
labeled and encrypted that your apps

661
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,799
have some form of adaptive access in

662
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,440
between them and and the identities and

663
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,679
the users accessing them your

664
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,120
infrastructure

665
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,480
has uh just in time versioning runtime

666
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,200
controls uh telemetry and all that stuff

667
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,919
ensuring that your network has traffic

668
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,320
filtering and segmentation ensuring that

669
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,960
all of this feeds into your threat

670
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,880
protection models doing continuous

671
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,120
assessment threat intelligence forensics

672
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
and things like that response automation

673
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
this is where it falls in and trying to

674
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,919
continuously optimize this policy now

675
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,640
this might be uh more abstract there's a

676
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
lot of solutions out there that fall

677
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,159
into all these little pieces um and that

678
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,320
would allow you to build something like

679
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,279
this

680
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,440
when it comes to it

681
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,320
the impact of doing this

682
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,640
is both around user access you will be

683
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,159
running a policy driven access

684
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,679
architecture where you explicitly

685
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,240
validate the trust of requests

686
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,320
uh and dynamically address any sort of

687
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,159
insufficient trust that you might find

688
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,720
you will be doing modern sec-ops which

689
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
is all about pervasive detection and

690
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,440
response and ensuring that you have a

691
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
deep visibility into your assets both

692
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,120
inside and outside the firewalls and you

693
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,600
have rapid remediation

694
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
and you also look at your operational

695
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,159
technology industrial internet of things

696
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,600
and all the goods

697
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,919
stuff that comes with that and your data

698
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,600
center you need to be able to monitor

699
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,640
and segment your assets by business risk

700
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,320
and this is all about the workload the

701
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,440
apps the apis device security and so on

702
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,880
now just

703
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,679
30 seconds on the maturity models

704
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,600
there's a couple of them out there

705
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,399
one was actually uh published this month

706
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,480
by microsoft you if you search for

707
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,320
evolving zero trust

708
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,399
they take you through how you can better

709
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,520
define

710
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,399
where you stand in the zero trust

711
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,279
road on the zero trust path if you will

712
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,919
and they've got some some nice easy to

713
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,640
understand references for all the

714
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
security pillars that they've identified

715
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,640
like identity and endpoints and network

716
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,720
applications and data

717
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,760
and where where you are exactly on on

718
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,039
that path

719
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,799
a more complex one was published by csa

720
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,720
in the us

721
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,399
and it's it's undergone some reviews and

722
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
the the final version of it this is

723
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,880
still a draft right now um the final

724
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,399
version of it is due to be published

725
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,559
soon following the feedback that they

726
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,880
collected in september and october

727
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,960
they're also looking at pillars they're

728
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,720
also looking at

729
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,279
trying to help you better identify and

730
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,960
organize

731
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,440
your way of of doing these things

732
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
internally

733
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,799
looking at identity and device and your

734
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,240
network and environment and your

735
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,039
application workloads and how you can

736
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,600
reach the next step if you will on this

737
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,640
on this maturity model

738
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,120
so that kind of brings us close to the

739
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,840
end

740
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,320
um just to sum things up um

741
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,399
it's important to understand that if

742
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,320
you're trying to apply all solutions to

743
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,120
modern problems it might not be enough

744
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,279
remote work is on the rise

745
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,600
it does bring new challenges and cyber

746
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,039
attacks are becoming more and more

747
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,120
complex and harder to detect and harder

748
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,520
to identify harder to to deal with

749
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,480
so

750
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,520
this is where zero trust comes from and

751
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,279
from

752
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,360
from one standpoint you could say that

753
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,000
it is as easy as one two three right one

754
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,640
verify everything explicitly two use

755
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,559
least privileged access and three use an

756
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,640
assumed breach approach

757
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,159
implementing these

758
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,039
means understanding these so it does go

759
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,480
back to user education and awareness

760
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,360
uh it's it's very important to ensure

761
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
that the people who are going to both

762
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,720
implement this and use this understand

763
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,360
why this is important and how this works

764
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,039
just doing it for the sake of doing it

765
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,279
and throwing technology

766
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,720
at the problem

767
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,039
is not the right solution you need the

768
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,720
people to be on board and you need them

769
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,880
to understand why you're doing this and

770
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,200
how you're doing this and

771
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,440
yes the policy driven architecture and

772
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,200
modern stack ops are things that are

773
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,320
worth looking at uh so you can just grab

774
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
one of those maturity models for zero

775
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,399
trust that were published and make sure

776
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,320
that you use the right tools for the

777
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,720
right job if you start implementing

778
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,000
those things

779
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,520
um

780
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,799
so just like what you should be doing

781
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,360
from tomorrow onwards or actually from

782
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,880
friday because tomorrow is the second

783
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,480
day of deathcam so you still need to

784
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,080
watch some sessions

785
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,320
so starting on friday

786
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,679
you need to start inventorying your

787
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,440
applications and workall identities make

788
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,000
sure you know where they are and what

789
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,679
they're supposed to be doing make sure

790
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,240
you govern and manage those as you do

791
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,640
your users make sure you enforce any

792
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,480
conditional access policies you assess

793
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,799
your security posture monitor for any

794
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,520
creep there and develop an automated

795
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
response and mitigation as much as

796
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,279
possible this is a good start

797
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,520
into an approach that will end up taking

798
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,320
you to the zero trust

799
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,519
model and to the zero trust approach um

800
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,880
and with that

801
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,159
i

802
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,240
am done if there are any questions

803
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,919
um if

804
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,919
we might have time for one or two

805
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,760
alexandra can confirm

806
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,000
um

807
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,880
there are many small ones but

808
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,919
i'm gonna start with this one um

809
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,919
following your excellent summary i've

810
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,919
been taking down so many notes i've

811
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,519
written more than in my last year of

812
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,640
college

813
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,799
um

814
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,120
i i was wondering how do you see in

815
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,440
practice the burden of tracking down the

816
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
myriad of permissions devices

817
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,760
authentication schemes do you feel like

818
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,480
organizations now have solid checklist

819
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,559
or automations in place or are we still

820
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,120
relying on the working memory of folks

821
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,279
working in internal security or tech

822
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,960
departments

823
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
yeah so right now it's mostly the the

824
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,519
second option by far um unfortunately um

825
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,159
there's a lot of companies that know

826
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,320
they should be doing this yet are still

827
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,960
not doing this the tools are right there

828
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,039
most of them are actually free they're

829
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,080
already

830
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,159
using them but they're not using them to

831
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,720
the fullest and that's

832
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,279
part of the problem in the end so

833
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,440
understanding where you stand and

834
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,840
understanding what those permissions are

835
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,919
and having a way to automate that

836
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,120
detection that assessment and then

837
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,320
taking steps to to implement any sort of

838
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,559
changes there is

839
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,720
is part of the the checklist that i gave

840
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,960
on my previous slide actually and it's

841
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,880
part of of uh doing things right yes so

842
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,039
we're not there yet uh the companies

843
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,360
that do understand that are the ones

844
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,760
that will have most to gain

845
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,279
moving forward

846
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,600
