1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,320
so to introduce our

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,120
uh last speaker of the day who is

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,440
bringing like the very

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,080
just a fascinating presentation uh we're

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,799
taking it to the next frontier uh and

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,519
we're taking the conversation into space

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,000
because cyber security is not only built

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,560
and necessary for disability of our

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,199
technology our companies our countries

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,080
our societies it's also important about

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,039
what we do next as a species and with

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,560
our technology

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,600
which also involves going into space

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,160
and there's been a lot of that happening

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,920
lately i mean traffic in space is

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
increasing so

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,920
there are plenty of challenges who are

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,320
new and interesting to address so i'm

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
very very uh privileged and happy to

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,199
bring you paul coggin today to deathcam

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,719
2021 with a presentation called pond in

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,039
space paul thank you so much for joining

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,399
us uh i wish we could all be in person

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,480
again i miss seeing everyone

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,959
hopefully uh next year we can everyone

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,040
can get back together again

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,360
uh but i appreciate the invitation

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,439
my area of interest i want to share with

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,840
you today is around space this

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
presentation is going to focus on

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,680
spacecraft

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,960
and

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,920
vulnerabilities and real world examples

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
of

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
exploits that have happened to

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
spacecraft

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,600
in the future i plan on

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,320
diving into ground systems and the whole

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,479
system of systems but this talk we're

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,560
going to focus on

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
the spacecraft itself

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,880
and uh especially like everything's in

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,520
the news with all of the uh

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,399
the new space companies space 2.0 et

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,680
cetera so i thought it might be of

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,640
interest

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,240
to uh

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
to all my friends here so

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,600
with

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,439
spacecraft

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,640
once you get the

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,200
spacecraft whether it's a space station

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
or

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
a satellite what have you in the space

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
it is managed and controlled

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,680
similar to a network operations center

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
security operations center you have uh

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,360
space operations

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
centers

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,319
space ground systems

61
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,720
that uh monitor and manage

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,200
the spacecraft as it orbits the earth it

63
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,520
could be in leo geo which we'll dive

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
into

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,440
the different heights of the orbit

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,840
in space but to make sure that the

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,239
spacecraft has coverage

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,319
and can be controlled and managed

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,840
no matter where it is in the orbit

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,160
especially for leo uh

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
in this example here we have

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,800
ground stations located around the world

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000
for nasa

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
so that they can carry toons

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,239
so i'm sorry to jump in but if you could

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,239
just share your screen so you can so we

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,239
can see the presentation as well sorry

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
to break your phone there okay it should

79
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,239
have been uh

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,720
should have been

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
shared

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
i'll re-share it you see it now

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,519
yes i can see it and then the tech team

84
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
can just switch to it so we can have it

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
in full view

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,599
okay let's just

87
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,599
appreciate it again

88
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,200
ready

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,480
so this is an example of a nasa

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
network and ground systems to monitor

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,319
and manage spacecraft

92
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,360
uh

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,799
assets that they're

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,200
managing for this near earth

95
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,840
network project

96
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,879
so that you can have complete coverage

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,360
no matter what the or where a spacecraft

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,680
is in orbit you would have uh

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,760
ground systems around the world

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,159
to make sure to ensure management and

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,640
monitoring and control

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,879
what's happening with the industry now

103
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,840
especially with what is termed space 2.0

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
with spacex

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,640
and other uh

106
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
new world uh space

107
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
companies that are coming out

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,439
all the cubesats all those projects is a

109
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,000
move toward

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
ground systems in the cloud

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,959
you have companies like amazon

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,239
microsoft they have they're offering

113
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,798
satellite ground system services in the

114
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,238
cloud uh my understanding is google is

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,479
going to provide

116
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,440
cloud-based ground system support

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,280
to spacex

118
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,720
and

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,479
and i believe i've read that google is

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,240
looking at expanding and offering

121
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
services possibly similar to what amazon

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
and microsoft is doing and there are

123
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,639
other uh some other vendors that also

124
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,960
provide a cloud-based

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
space ground system solution so that uh

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
organizations don't have to go and build

127
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,320
a diverse ground system network around

128
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,639
the world to drive down their costs so

129
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,479
they can focus on their spacecraft

130
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,919
mission so it's really interesting to

131
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,400
see what's happening with uh space and

132
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
the cloud

133
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
now when we talk about spacecraft

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,639
orbiting in space

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,479
what a lot of what we read about today

136
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,520
is spacecraft cubesats that are going

137
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,639
into a leo orbit a low earth orbit

138
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,600
and they're about 160 kilometers to 2000

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,919
kilometers orbiting the earth and then

140
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,240
you have the higher earth orbit where

141
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,120
there's 16 000 to 133 000 kilometers uh

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
in space and then you have medium earth

143
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
orbit 2000 to

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
to roughly 36 000 and then you have geo

145
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
which is uh

146
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
around 36

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
close to 36 thousand kilometers maybe

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,240
greater

149
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,479
and the geo

150
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,120
it is going to be orbiting at a fixed

151
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,840
point on the earth the geo will always

152
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,560
be pointing at the same place

153
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,440
all the time where the leo is orbiting

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
the earth very quickly

155
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,720
so you may have coverage for a few hours

156
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
on a particular leo satellite and that's

157
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,479
where they're coming up with ideas of

158
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,360
how to network leo satellites together

159
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,520
so that you have continuous coverage

160
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,000
as the leos ads

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
orbit the earth

162
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
now no we're prepared to talk about

163
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,759
cyber security and so

164
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,400
the federation of american scientists

165
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,479
have come up with

166
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,080
five

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
categories of threats to spacecraft

168
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,680
there's deception

169
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,520
where someone can influence the

170
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
spacecraft to

171
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,600
send incorrect information

172
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
maybe you

173
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
a threat actor

174
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,160
temporarily disrupts or denies a

175
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,039
capability on the satellite and with the

176
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,280
disruption denial maybe it's a

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
electronic warfare some kind of

178
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,960
radio frequency jamming some kind of rf

179
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
attack

180
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,759
where

181
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,280
the attack occurs and then it goes away

182
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
they term you know the power is removed

183
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,680
the signal the rf signal is removed and

184
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,319
then the spacecraft is able to operate

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
like it normally would then there's

186
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
degradation where

187
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,639
permanent damage is done to

188
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,520
the spacecraft could be uh say maybe it

189
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,960
could be a laser

190
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,479
uh that that damages uh a part of the

191
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,400
spacecraft or

192
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
or uh some other kinetic type attack

193
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,400
possibly and then there's the

194
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,639
destruction like we we read about a lot

195
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,800
of countries or testing asap

196
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,560
capabilities where they're actually

197
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,120
blowing spacecraft up to test

198
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,639
the ability for a missile to hit a

199
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,160
spacecraft so i would just totally take

200
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
it out

201
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,039
so those that's some examples of threats

202
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,440
to get into more detail

203
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
uh regarding space systems and cyber

204
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,120
threats

205
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,599
you have a jamming which is focusing

206
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,039
just like i mentioned don't like

207
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,440
electronic warfare radio frequency

208
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,120
jamming

209
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
which was going to require a great deal

210
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
of power

211
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,280
and uh an antenna to that has the

212
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
ability to

213
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,319
send a very strong signal and overcome

214
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,639
uh the good signals

215
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,199
of the satellite uh malware i've got an

216
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,479
example of uh malware a couple examples

217
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,360
of malware on spacecraft

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,919
spoofing

219
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,680
the control payload so the satellite it

220
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
has the control

221
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,360
the control system for the satellite

222
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,120
that flies the satellite itself and then

223
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
there's the payload portion of the

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,919
satellite and the payload is going to

225
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,200
have maybe tied into one network and and

226
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
then there's a different

227
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
network that is controlling and flying

228
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,680
the satellite itself so the payload may

229
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,040
be targeted where the experiments and

230
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
scientific discovery

231
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
uh whatever application it is if a

232
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,959
satellite it's providing in that payload

233
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,279
that can be targeted and then you have

234
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,160
uh the control telemetry tracking and

235
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,320
control and that's where the satellite

236
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,440
is being flown the ttnc that could be

237
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,040
targeted

238
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
specifically

239
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,760
in and if there's not encryption being

240
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,959
used

241
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,760
and

242
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
there's a great deal of the satellites

243
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,279
that are flying today

244
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,240
that are not using encryption

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,800
because of the cost it costs a great

246
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
deal of money uh to add really strong

247
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,519
encryption to the satellites so in many

248
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,080
cases there's not encryption being used

249
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,920
so it

250
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
it could

251
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,360
make some some of the satellites could

252
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
be vulnerable to replay attacks that

253
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,640
we're familiar with in land-based

254
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,519
attacks uh of course you could hack it

255
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,440
typically the hacking is probably going

256
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,320
to be through a ground system first

257
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,560
someone is most likely

258
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,600
most likely would the trust relationship

259
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,519
of a ground system would be exploited

260
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,600
first and then from the ground system

261
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,880
then uh the satellite would be targeted

262
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,399
in most cases and then you could

263
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,480
possibly do some hijacking and

264
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
eavesdropping again going back to a lack

265
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
of encryption

266
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
uh there's been been a lot of

267
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
presentations at black hat over the last

268
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
couple years

269
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,160
talking about being able to eavesdrop on

270
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,920
network connections uh satellite

271
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,959
connections

272
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,560
and because of a lack of encryption

273
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,760
and we're going to go into some real

274
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,320
world examples of that as well in the

275
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,959
next few slides

276
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,800
so

277
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,279
we talked about threats

278
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,120
and one thing

279
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,200
with the spacecraft threats if it's like

280
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,680
the elect electronic warfare some kind

281
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,040
of rf radio frequency jamming

282
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,519
those type of attacks are reversible

283
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,800
you deny the service while you're

284
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
you're you're sending a very strong

285
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,959
signal it's been generated directed at

286
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,320
the saddle a lot

287
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
but as soon as that is turned off it

288
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,399
goes away and the spacecraft can go back

289
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,399
to operating as normal

290
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,640
but

291
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,680
you start

292
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,959
going to say connect acts

293
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,040
that would physically

294
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
damage the satellite like shooting a

295
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,519
missile or maybe a laser or something

296
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,240
like that then that is not going to be

297
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
reversible but

298
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
in the typica depending on the the cyber

299
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,079
attack

300
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,200
what kind of access an actor get

301
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
has to a satellite they might be able to

302
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,079
do something that's non-reversible just

303
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,360
like you would do to a data center asset

304
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,399
in a lan because you know it's a

305
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,560
computer but you know depending on the

306
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
level of control someone has they might

307
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,560
be able to go and do permanent damage

308
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,839
that is

309
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,560
to the satellite

310
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,000
so

311
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,040
the

312
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,360
open theoretical attack strategy

313
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,240
looking uh say if you're going to look

314
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
at the risk to your spacecraft systems

315
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,880
if anyone

316
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,760
uh is looking at securing a new

317
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
satellite venture that they're a part of

318
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
wanting to secure those assets here's an

319
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
attack tree to just some ideas to think

320
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,360
about you have the ground station that

321
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
you need to secure

322
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
you

323
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,639
make sure there's no that you mitigate

324
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,240
insider threats

325
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
not only the digital access but also

326
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,440
physical because there's always an

327
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,320
insider thread as we all will know

328
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,839
and uh the

329
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,920
you know use air gaps

330
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,920
and one-way dials etc to limit access

331
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
into the space the ground system network

332
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,839
that's controlling the spacecraft i

333
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,920
personally prefer prefer

334
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,959
a

335
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,040
a hard air gap but as we move toward

336
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
cloud that means

337
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
these cloud-based ground systems are

338
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
going to be connected to the internet so

339
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,279
that you can remotely access your uh

340
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,240
your cloud resource say it's amazon

341
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,279
google

342
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
uh so we're gonna need to really lock

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,760
down uh that remote access into that

344
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
ground system and then uh very

345
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,040
theoretical there's nothing being

346
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
published that i've been able to find in

347
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,399
the open source

348
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,519
uh about a satellite to satellite attack

349
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,440
but it is theoretical

350
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,519
that especially with all the advances

351
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,040
happening with

352
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,800
onboard computers

353
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,880
um the computer capability i actually

354
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,399
read the other day where there's a

355
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,959
company looking at putting a 19-inch

356
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,519
rack server in a satellite and being

357
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,320
able to run like micro data centers in

358
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,200
space

359
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
so those capability satellites are

360
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
getting more sophisticated so it could

361
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,360
be that at some point we could be have a

362
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,000
threat of a satellite to satellite cyber

363
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
attack

364
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
you know where the rf where a satellite

365
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,440
is targeting doing rf attacks or optical

366
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,040
attacks

367
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,480
trying to get into the network possibly

368
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,199
and then there's also the threat if

369
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,079
if a threat actor has the resources they

370
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,720
might be able to throw up a

371
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,639
unauthorized ground station

372
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
and if the satellite is not using strong

373
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,680
encryption it could be possible for

374
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,519
a threat actor using an unauthorized

375
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,440
ground station

376
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,839
to possibly influence the spacecraft

377
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,760
maybe possibly gain gain control and

378
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,639
access either gain access to the control

379
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,959
system on the satellite or possibly the

380
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,639
payload

381
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
depending on their capabilities

382
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,800
the

383
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,800
here's one reference that they really uh

384
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,079
called my attention was years ago

385
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,839
everybody was talking about stuxnet but

386
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,040
it's not

387
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,639
if i never saw a whole lot of

388
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,880
conversation about

389
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
about this uh event where around the

390
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,199
same time that stuxnet came out

391
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,000
a satellite that was made providing

392
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,880
cable tv services in india called inside

393
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,800
4b

394
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,600
is

395
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,040
what was said to have been targeted by

396
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,920
uh stuxnet so going back to that trust

397
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,600
relationship we talked about earlier

398
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,839
with the ground system somehow sucks in

399
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,480
it either through someone bringing in a

400
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,880
thumb drive or some other kind of media

401
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,639
or some kind of uh internet connection

402
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,920
uh

403
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,399
somehow that trust relationship

404
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,000
with the ground system to the satellite

405
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,880
got breached and the stuxnet malware

406
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,199
was introduced into the ground system

407
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
network most likely

408
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,120
and through that trust relationship was

409
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,639
able to spread and find its way onto the

410
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,880
inside 4b satellite

411
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,199
it and

412
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
it is said that the inside 4b satellite

413
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,920
was running the same siemens plc

414
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,360
programmable programmable logical

415
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,279
controller

416
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,240
uh

417
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
that the original target for the malware

418
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,320
was running and what was happening with

419
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
that plc plc is it was used to control

420
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,519
their solar panels on the satellite so

421
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,759
it ended up disabling the solar panels

422
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
it is speculated

423
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,720
and

424
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,440
thus uh killing the satellite so

425
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
there's an example

426
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,800
now there's a lot of arguments about

427
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,399
whether it happened or not but there's a

428
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,320
whole lot of coincidence it lined up

429
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
really closely that it seemed strongly

430
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
insinuates that this is what happened to

431
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,680
the nsat 4b satellite

432
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,880
and i'll provide a reference there

433
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,000
and then satellites do use programmable

434
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
logic controllers in some cases a lot of

435
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,560
the same systems that are on the using

436
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,000
critical infrastructure are used on

437
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,560
satellites

438
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,800
now

439
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,880
no

440
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,759
one

441
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,000
i mentioned uh early in the presentation

442
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
about some of the satellites are not

443
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,759
using encryption

444
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,199
and one of the reasons they're not using

445
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,040
encryption the what's driving the

446
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,480
expense

447
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,600
is radiation in space

448
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
there's what you call space weather it's

449
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,360
a uh

450
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,680
and with radiation and solar flares

451
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,199
coming from the sun

452
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,440
and there's all these

453
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,679
microscopic particles

454
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,359
that can

455
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,760
inject themselves can affect

456
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,079
negatively affect computers running on

457
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,359
the satellites

458
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,839
and if you were running encryption on a

459
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,240
satellite and there's like some kind of

460
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,119
solar storm etc it could go and

461
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,160
negatively affect the processor and and

462
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,119
if you're

463
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,439
trying to do encryption it could mess up

464
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,720
the keying

465
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,640
of the encryption and you could possibly

466
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,400
lose control of your satellite

467
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,799
because of a solar storm and so what you

468
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,120
have to do is you have to use equipment

469
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,320
that has been protected

470
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,960
for the harsh environment of space with

471
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,360
all the radiation issues and that drives

472
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
up the cost that radiation protection

473
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,480
just drives up the cost of using strong

474
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
encryption and so therefore a lot of

475
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
companies choose

476
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,960
because the business economics choose

477
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,640
you do not use encryption and try to use

478
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,799
other means to protect their satellite

479
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,679
from hackers but as we all know being

480
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,679
cyber security professionals if it's not

481
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,400
encrypted someone is probably going to

482
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
find a way to try to sniff it

483
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,120
analyze your traffic

484
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,840
and see what's going on with it

485
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,120
and so we'll go into some examples here

486
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,600
uh one example

487
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,760
of a lack of encryption on satellites

488
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
this real world and i provided the

489
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,639
source preference there at the bottom

490
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
is a a few years ago

491
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
there was a

492
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,799
a

493
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,880
a satellite that was used for

494
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,120
communications that was discovered that

495
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
there was people in brazil and

496
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,919
apparently 39

497
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,400
39 people in six brazilian states got

498
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,200
arrested for illegally using

499
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,480
a satellite for cb cb radio

500
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,200
communications

501
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,960
and and it was possible because

502
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
because it was unencrypted

503
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,280
so so when you read about in the open

504
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,559
when you read out in the papers

505
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,840
everybody talks about encryption

506
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,000
encryption encryption with space

507
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
uh

508
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,039
some things are encrypted

509
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
some things that are very sensitive are

510
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,760
encrypted but there's a reason why

511
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,480
people are able to hijack cable tv

512
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,600
signals

513
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,840
internet

514
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,320
etc because a lot of places uh it's

515
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,840
it's not encrypted because like i said

516
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,440
the expense of putting um

517
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,240
radiation resistant hardware in space to

518
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,960
protect the crypto and here's an example

519
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
of internet

520
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,559
there was a there's a piece of malware

521
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,280
that was developed that kapersky

522
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,440
speculates was sourced out of russia

523
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
and in this case

524
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,600
a user

525
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
would get infected

526
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,360
and use their satellite internet

527
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
connection to establish the command

528
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
control and once command control was

529
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,720
established over the uh through the

530
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
satellite connection

531
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,559
the satellite internet because it's all

532
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,799
unencrypted

533
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,200
the uh the thread actors the malware the

534
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,520
malware server and the users were all

535
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,600
able to communicate there is no problem

536
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
uh communicating because it's

537
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,360
unencrypted communications

538
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,200
and once uh the command control the

539
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,159
initial

540
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,320
connection was set up then the

541
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,200
connection would reroute over a

542
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,480
terrestrial land-based network to x-fil

543
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,960
data whatever the the malware's purpose

544
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,840
was so this is just a this is a real

545
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,039
world example

546
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,880
of unencrypted communications being

547
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,440
exploited

548
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,880
now another another uh example of

549
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,720
unencrypted communications

550
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,919
is uh that you may you may be aware of

551
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,760
was uh

552
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,559
drones the uh

553
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,559
the unmanned aerial vehicle

554
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,919
in this case there was video

555
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,280
communication

556
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,240
uh

557
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
actually gps communication

558
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,520
timing

559
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
um

560
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,720
that was uh affected because of a lack

561
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
of uh

562
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
encryption

563
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,679
now

564
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,360
here this goes back to where i talked

565
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,280
about in the attack tree this is a

566
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,080
theoretical

567
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,559
attack there's nothing in the open

568
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,400
source that i've been able to find but

569
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
there is some open some open source

570
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,080
speculation about this being a

571
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,640
possibility i've seen in a few papers

572
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,360
of the satellite to satellite attack so

573
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,559
it could be

574
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,159
that a that a

575
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,480
as the technology evolves rapidly the

576
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,880
way it is it could be

577
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,640
that a rogue satellite could possibly be

578
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,159
in orbit in leo or geo and possibly do

579
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,280
some kind of man in the middle attack

580
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,919
and possibly try to intercept rf

581
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,840
communications between

582
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,120
between satellites or possibly try to

583
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,320
get in between an optical uh free space

584
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
optics connection

585
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
that's a big hot topic right now is free

586
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,760
space optics uh has been able to to use

587
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,919
optical technology use light which is a

588
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,480
whole lot more secure than rf where rf

589
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,039
radio frequency is just being radiated

590
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,159
uh and is more open

591
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:32,960
to

592
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,200
other

593
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,520
other people being able to listen and

594
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,240
capture the traffic where the optical

595
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,840
it's going to be obviously it's going to

596
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
be a laser it's going to be more

597
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
directed and so if it's going to be hard

598
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,799
optical it's going to be harder to

599
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,200
intercept but this is a theoretical

600
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,320
scenario

601
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,919
that it'll be interesting to see what

602
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,200
happens in the future what gets

603
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,280
published about this is uh

604
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,400
is that

605
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,559
as the spacecraft technology evolves

606
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,840
uh now

607
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,039
here's a real world example of a

608
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,039
a satellite

609
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,440
called rosat

610
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,760
that is speculated to been captured

611
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,840
there's argument back and forth i've

612
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,240
read online about whether it was

613
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,080
actually hacked

614
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,120
but everything i've read

615
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,039
everything i've read in

616
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,799
is pointing toward that the satellite

617
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,120
was hacked most likely the ground system

618
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,520
was first hacked

619
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
and then from the ground system the

620
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,679
satellite was taken control of or

621
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,200
someone had a rogue

622
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
they had a uh possibly had a road ground

623
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,080
system that they were able to use to to

624
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
take control of the roadside if he

625
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
wasn't using strong encryption

626
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,880
and

627
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,200
and it was able to be control take

628
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,720
control was taken

629
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,880
and it was able to be

630
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,720
turned toward the sun

631
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,640
and it was able to to

632
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,559
damage the capability of the satellite

633
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
now here's another here's an example uh

634
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,640
this landsat sat seven i have two

635
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,039
examples here of this attack

636
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,200
uh two different satellites there's

637
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,600
landsat 7 where it was

638
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,720
taking control of for 12 minutes back in

639
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,240
october 2007 and july 2008 whoever the

640
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,039
threat actor was

641
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,400
had all of the access they needed

642
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,720
to control the satellite they did not do

643
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,279
anything to the satellite but they had

644
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,559
access

645
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,880
the the from the forensics that was done

646
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
it was determined that whoever the actor

647
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,600
was had complete control of the access

648
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
and they could if they knew what they

649
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,240
were doing they could have uh

650
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,559
took control of the satellite now i'm

651
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,000
going to do a presentation in the future

652
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
hopefully i'll get to return to death

653
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,279
camp and present on this where i'm going

654
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,039
to present about all the numerous

655
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
operating systems and the numerous

656
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,400
languages

657
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,320
uh that are used

658
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,520
to control the satellite i think uh

659
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,200
and so it might have been that they got

660
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
the initial access but they may not have

661
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,840
been familiar with the commands for the

662
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,640
particular operating system and uh

663
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,480
and it was used on the satellite and

664
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,159
maybe maybe

665
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
that obscurity

666
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
lent to them not being able to

667
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,840
fly the satellite themselves and they

668
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,520
just had the initial handhold

669
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,159
similarly a very similar attack around

670
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,480
the same time frame uh was the terra

671
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
satellite

672
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,080
and it was attacked in june 2008 and

673
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,200
october 2008 in the and the act threat

674
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,919
actors had control for two minutes on

675
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,919
the first attack and then nine minutes

676
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,279
for the second attack and similarly they

677
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
had the access

678
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,279
but they did not take complete control

679
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,679
of the satellite to fly it

680
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,320
uh and again i'm i'm i'm wondering is

681
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
speculating whether they

682
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
whether they knew the operating system

683
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,200
the commands

684
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,760
to control the satellite it's very it's

685
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,320
interesting

686
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,640
that they did not uh go and influence

687
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,200
how the satellite was uh flying and you

688
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,080
know

689
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,679
influence its orbit or something like

690
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,919
that

691
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,840
and

692
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,159
then here here's another

693
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,600
real world attack that happened it's

694
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,440
published out in the open source where

695
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
there is a u.s weather satellite that

696
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,760
was taking control of

697
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,880
uh this one this is one i found very

698
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,600
interesting there's a uh

699
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,720
there was a

700
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,640
satellite network that was comprised of

701
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,840
four satellites owned by the uk and my

702
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,919
understanding is this these are

703
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,880
skynet it's four satellites and they're

704
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,200
military satellites and my understanding

705
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
is that one of the satellites

706
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,080
was actually taken control of in helford

707
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,360
ransom

708
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,120
which is really interesting

709
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,919
uh

710
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,400
and uh which leads into uh

711
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
i don't have any uh slides on this you

712
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,360
know

713
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
but a uh

714
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,600
an

715
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,679
interesting thread to pull with all the

716
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,120
new satellites that are being put up in

717
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,679
space and they're run and

718
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,279
they're running like linux operating

719
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,440
systems all the different

720
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,320
uh

721
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,760
it's moving more and more toward open

722
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,039
source for

723
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,480
the uh the satellites that are being

724
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,399
launched today all the cube sites we're

725
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,679
hearing about all the thousands and

726
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,799
thousands of satellites that the

727
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,480
internet providers are going to to

728
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,000
launch into space

729
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,840
uh wouldn't it be it'd be really

730
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,080
interesting uh what the threat the

731
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,760
threat surface is

732
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,240
for ransom you know speaking of uh

733
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,159
satellite being taken ransomware

734
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,200
ransomware hitting a spacecraft

735
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,080
and

736
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,000
some kind of worm that propagates across

737
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,279
space

738
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,080
how would we deal with that i mean

739
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,840
that's that that's theoretically

740
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,840
possible

741
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,880
another real world attack you might not

742
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,559
be familiar with this this happened on

743
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,640
the space station it's it's not a

744
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,960
satellite to take her but i just wanted

745
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,760
to be complete in my research

746
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,360
of what i could find out in the open

747
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,000
source of spacecraft

748
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,679
with space station is certainly a

749
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,600
spacecraft and what happened here is

750
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
astronauts

751
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
unintentionally

752
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,279
just like what happens on the ground

753
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,120
somebody brings in a thumb drive sticks

754
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,799
in a thumb drive on this on the space

755
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,080
station

756
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,159
and it has malware on the thumb drive go

757
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,360
figure uh and infects the network on the

758
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,559
space station

759
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,039
it did not it did not infect the control

760
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,480
system that flies the space station but

761
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,640
there was a network that it was able the

762
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,880
malware was able to spread to and so

763
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,679
they had to go in and clean it up

764
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,960
and then

765
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,320
and then there was a second event where

766
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,799
a laptop got brought in with a piece of

767
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,760
mirror on it and it was able to spread

768
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,000
across the network i found that

769
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,120
very

770
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,760
interesting luckily it did not

771
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,120
luckily the

772
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,679
fly control network is isolated

773
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,919
from the networks that got infected

774
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,520
but

775
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,360
uh but i wanted to be complete and show

776
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,760
you know there's

777
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,159
lots of things happening in space

778
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,640
that need to be dealt with and mitigated

779
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,600
and plan for just like we have on any

780
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,959
critical infrastructure on the ground

781
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,760
now

782
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,880
if you're interested in diving into

783
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,520
security solutions for space maybe

784
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,919
you're working for a startup or

785
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,039
some other space agency this is a

786
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,440
the consultative committee for space

787
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,600
data systems is an international

788
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,480
organization numerous numerous countries

789
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,760
are a part of the ccsds

790
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,880
and

791
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,039
and they not only have security

792
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,840
documents but best practices

793
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,520
of how to secure the space protocols the

794
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,679
operating systems the commands the

795
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,919
ground systems the spacecraft but they

796
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,600
also provide

797
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,919
uh standards and best practices for

798
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,880
developing pro various protocols

799
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,520
how to uh you know build the ground

800
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,640
systems

801
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,200
the spacecraft architecture but they but

802
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,760
they do address security and they have

803
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,600
really good documentation and

804
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,080
recommendations on cryptography

805
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,240
uh how to lock down the trust

806
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,760
relationships

807
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,600
within the ground system between the

808
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
ground system and the spacecraft et

809
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,039
cetera so

810
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,480
if you're interested in this and you

811
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,399
want to go and look at uh some really

812
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,520
good

813
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,200
uh references i check out the ccsds

814
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,039
website it's out they have ton of

815
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,960
information out there that's publicly

816
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,240
available if you're interested in

817
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,960
further research

818
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,399
and similarly

819
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,840
here's a

820
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,000
a pretty good list of what i found

821
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,480
available for best practices

822
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,399
for securing satellites the spacecraft

823
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,840
uh bider

824
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,120
they have a document for best practices

825
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,200
for for small satellites uh nist i'm

826
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,679
sure everyone has heard of

827
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,679
the nist organization they publish a lot

828
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,799
of uh

829
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,320
standards that international

830
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,960
organizations follow they've got a new

831
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,279
document that they're working on called

832
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,360
uh number 8270 it's an introduction to

833
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,799
cyber security for commercial satellite

834
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,159
operations

835
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,559
this document is draft right now the

836
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,320
last time i looked is still in draft and

837
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,640
the number is 8270 if you're interested

838
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,600
let's look up nist 8270

839
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,440
and that is going to be a really good

840
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,279
document resource if you're involved

841
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,120
with space

842
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,880
or interested in doing some research on

843
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,559
that of how to

844
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,880
defend your spacecraft and then there's

845
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,600
a

846
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,120
the committee on national security

847
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,799
system cnss

848
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,799
they have a number of uh documents

849
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,159
available

850
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,279
um aerospace corporation

851
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,480
they have

852
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,679
a number of best practices for

853
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,880
securing spacecraft

854
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,600
and there's uh also the orbital security

855
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,559
alliance they have uh some good

856
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,000
guidelines

857
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,960
for

858
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,760
space system cyber security

859
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,919
there's a gentleman that's a part of

860
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,399
orbital security alliance i recommend

861
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,399
that you follow his name's uh

862
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,760
dr greg falco and dr greg falco

863
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
publishes a lot of really really good

864
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,840
quality papers he's a part of the

865
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,760
orbital security alliance

866
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,960
if you want

867
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,399
some more details

868
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,879
on that

869
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,919
now some of my recommendations is if

870
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,919
you're involved with the space industry

871
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,679
whether it's on the ground system or

872
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,760
you're involved with the whole system of

873
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,600
systems with the spacecraft and the

874
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,399
ground system is to utilize

875
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,120
death sec ops and in the initial design

876
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,720
and development

877
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,519
used

878
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,720
building

879
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
design security in from the very

880
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,039
beginning and doing you know good code

881
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,840
review and implementing best practices

882
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,519
in the uh the operation and

883
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,480
configuration of the network uh

884
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,000
in the week the weakest link in the

885
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,279
chain is going to open up the

886
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,200
vulnerability as we all know

887
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,960
in that supply chain

888
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,279
whether it's the chips

889
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,840
the the operating system the application

890
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,880
vendors

891
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,519
the cloud system vendors whoever we use

892
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,360
need to really keep a good eye

893
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,640
keep an eye on that supply chain

894
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,120
and design the architecture with zero

895
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,679
trust defense in depth

896
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,559
and lock down those uh communications

897
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,519
and the processes in these systems

898
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,039
from the very beginning it's gonna be

899
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,679
easier to lock it down

900
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,720
in the lab and prove out a good template

901
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,799
solution that works

902
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,560
uh before we get that we get a

903
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,320
spacecraft in space and

904
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,000
we're not going to be able to start uh

905
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,560
redesigning the network once we get it

906
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,079
up in space it's going to be hard to

907
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,560
make changes

908
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,040
again going back to encryption really

909
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,280
need to try to get encryption on these

910
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,760
communication links because if it's not

911
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,079
encrypted if it's sensitive information

912
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,679
someone's going to be able to uh

913
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,440
to passively sit out there and monitor

914
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
and if and it might be able to go and do

915
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,719
replay attacks it may be able to try to

916
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,879
take control of the satellite

917
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,918
by doing replay attacks injection etc

918
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,599
one of the things that i found very

919
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,520
interesting in the research

920
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,560
that may surprise some of you is

921
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,679
as i mentioned earlier that these

922
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,760
satellites are moving toward

923
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,359
there's a one vendor that's actually

924
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,320
talking about believe it's a leo cloud i

925
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,040
believe is the one leo cloud is uh

926
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,480
i believe they're talking about putting

927
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,000
a 19-inch server

928
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,119
into a satellite and the servers are

929
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,280
running operating systems and a lot of

930
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,760
them are the new ones are running a

931
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,079
linux derivative so so there's a lot of

932
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,800
talk about run using logging intrusion

933
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,480
prevention systems

934
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,160
uh

935
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,839
machine learning and artificial

936
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,760
intelligence that's actually our machine

937
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,920
learning and artificial intelligence is

938
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,320
actually going to be a payload

939
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,119
uh application that is operated in space

940
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,920
and provided as a service to customers

941
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,280
but we should also look at the machine

942
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,200
learning and artificial intelligence to

943
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,800
monitor the satellite if we have the

944
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,359
resources for security purposes to

945
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,440
monitor that telemetry network telemetry

946
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,800
data and monitor commands

947
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,240
and traffic

948
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,760
to make sure that the trust

949
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,839
relationships are not being exploited

950
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,480
and maybe maybe an insider

951
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,599
is

952
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,079
is not trying to

953
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,560
to send commands that are not authorized

954
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,160
or out of the norm

955
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,280
and and again monitor that uh telemetry

956
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,440
tracking and control could

957
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
monitor that very closely to make sure

958
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,040
someone is not trying to send commands

959
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,160
to

960
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,359
to fly the satellite or

961
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,920
change the satellite's orbit

962
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,000
sensing any type of commands that are

963
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,040
not typical not scheduled

964
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,440
not recognized try to keep a real

965
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
not only monitor that on the ground but

966
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,680
but also monitor it on the spacecraft

967
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,640
itself

968
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,119
and use strict and use strict system

969
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,800
configuration management and where

970
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
things are headed with with this system

971
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,800
configuration management

972
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,800
uh and you might find interesting is

973
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,720
that just like we're virtualizing the

974
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,960
data centers on the ground

975
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,560
virtualization is happening on the

976
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
satellites there there is a

977
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,640
virtualization so it's called uh

978
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,880
software-defined satellites

979
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,040
where virtualization is actually being

980
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,720
implemented on the satellite and even

981
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,240
containers where app were payload

982
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,119
capabilities where the experiments

983
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,599
the research that scientists different

984
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,200
organizations may be

985
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,599
using on the satellite

986
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,400
say image processing

987
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,720
whatever whatever application it is it's

988
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,960
been the system's been used for

989
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,280
uh they're actually uh research actually

990
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,200
not in not only virtual machines but

991
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,680
also containers

992
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,440
so that opens up a lot of interesting

993
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,320
possibilities for

994
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,599
from a security standpoint

995
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,079
but

996
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,680
that's pretty much what i have to share

997
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,799
with the team today

998
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,119
i hope this was informative and

999
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,640
interesting to everyone and i have a

1000
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,000
whole lot more research that i'm doing

1001
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,480
that i'm hoping to bring back and share

1002
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,240
with everyone in the future hopefully

1003
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,520
like i said hopefully we'll get to meet

1004
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,599
in person soon

1005
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,320
maybe next year

1006
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,320
romania is one of my favorite countries

1007
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,480
i love i love bucharest

1008
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,400
i recommend i recommend everybody to go

1009
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,480
visit bucharest romania is a beautiful

1010
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,800
country oh thank you so so much this has

1011
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,359
been not just interesting it has been

1012
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,560
mind-blowing altogether i mean i i can't

1013
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,720
even begin to

1014
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,160
say how

1015
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,240
incredible your presentation was not

1016
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,160
just because you showed us

1017
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,240
how many things might happen but how

1018
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,079
many hit things have already happened

1019
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,960
that

1020
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,119
many of us if not all of us weren't

1021
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,440
aware of i mean this is

1022
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,000
an entirely kind of new universe of

1023
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,240
possibilities both for defenders and

1024
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,400
unfortunately for malicious actors as

1025
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,119
well so there's a lot of possibility and

1026
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,880
this is something that i love about this

1027
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,040
industry is that it gives you the

1028
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
opportunity to contribute to something

1029
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,560
meaningful and impactful in the realist

1030
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,760
sense so uh thank you for giving us you

1031
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,480
know so many examples and for kind of

1032
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,000
opening up this entire new field that we

1033
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,359
can explore and and hopefully understand

1034
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,119
better because it's it's already

1035
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,520
happening and as usual technology is um

1036
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,480
sometimes

1037
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,359
you know

1038
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,440
a lot more fast-paced than security can

1039
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,640
keep up with but uh it's people like you

1040

they're not in the field which we're all

1069
