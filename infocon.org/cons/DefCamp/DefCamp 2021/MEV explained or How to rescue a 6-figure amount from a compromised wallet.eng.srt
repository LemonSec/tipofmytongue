1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
okay so ah i think we all uh we'd all

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,080
like to take a moment after chris's

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,080
presentation to kind of

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,960
uh just take that all in uh but we still

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
have one more presentation and then

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,360
we'll be able to kind of let our brain

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,440
process everything that's happened

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,800
throughout this these almost two days

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,840
and give ourselves a chance to

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,519
you know just put it all together and

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,119
let our brain connect the dots because

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,039
it does that best when it has a chance

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,840
to you know just look in the distance

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,800
mti seemingly thinking of nothing

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,600
so it is my pleasure to introduce our

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,000
last speaker of the day

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,480
who is about to share uh one of his

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,320
stories as well um it's a presentation

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,000
where the crypto world and cyber

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,320
security meet obviously they're deeply

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,480
connected uh they're

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,399
you know extremely important for each

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,960
other it's just what we've been talking

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,719
about throughout the two have the past

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,879
two days all of the systems are

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,479
interconnected they are um you know they

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,360
they depend on each other to work to

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,840
thrive uh and for us to be able to use

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,840
them and thrive ourselves so anatol

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,479
welcome to death camp you're a long time

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,880
friend long time contributor long time

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,360
super involved member of the community

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,759
and i'm excited to hear all about you

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,880
know how to

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
rescue compromised wallets which is and

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,040
i

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,280
have a sense that it will be a bigger

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
and bigger problem

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,000
hello andra nice to meet you and yes i'm

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
uh involved with defcon for a long

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,720
long period of time

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,119
i've been there for a while and

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,720
organized uh competitions ctfs and all

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,880
that uh my new journey is uh crypto for

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,079
uh the last past two years at least so

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,119
i've seen a lot happening and uh

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,360
of course having a security background

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,640
uh you cannot uh

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,759
not notice uh the amount of hacks and

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,399
everything that happens in the space so

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,318
uh let's try to show the screen and

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,440
begin the presentation

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,120
there we go can you see it

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,680
i can and everyone else will be able to

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
in just a second so please go right

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,480
ahead and we'll make sure that yeah

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,280
there you go the stage okay

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,239
uh so um

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,640
for uh for me to uh go through this

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
presentation uh

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,920
as i'm going through this presentations

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
i'll have uh to first explain what math

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,599
is

64
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,720
uh and then we'll get to the actual

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,599
story on how to use math to basically

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,440
rescue huge amounts of funds from

67
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
compromised wallets

68
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,000
so first of all uh about myself i'm the

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,680
founder of the security espresso

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
community it's been uh already a few

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,640
years since we're we've been organizing

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
um

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
workshops and uh

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
meetups and all that i'm a security

75
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,440
researcher uh that's my uh i started as

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
a developer and then moved to the

77
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,640
security

78
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
field uh i doubled i've double with

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,840
web linux mobile and lately with the

80
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,239
blockchain uh as a developer i uh

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,080
started actually uh

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,879
using php in the very beginning and then

83
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,440
switched to javascript and solid by i

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,319
but i still use whatever it takes to do

85
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,519
the job done to get the job done

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,799
and uh

87
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,760
previously i spoke at dev camp at volvo

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
ctf os dev talks and other conferences

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
if you secret ui uav

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,840
etc at a lot of meetups

91
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,799
um when organizing death camp i uh was

92
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,200
in charge with dctf uh they've come

93
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
captured the flag competition uh i was

94
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,120
the one i think i was the one that

95
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,519
introduced the wi-fi palm board or at

96
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,200
least um

97
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,480
uh i was one of the

98
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,439
uh

99
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
guys who worked on the current version

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,959
that we uh had uh when we had live uh

101
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,239
conferences

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,000
and um

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,560
i was uh involved with hector bank i

104
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
can't wait to

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,279
uh get to a physical conference and uh

106
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,479
actually get back to organizing this um

107
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,160
uh

108
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,639
these competitions that like uh usually

109
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,520
uh on site and i'm a coffee addict i

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,479
have to i have to confess about that

111
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,440
so who is this stock for uh first of all

112
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
it will be uh

113
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,120
helpful for blockchain developers uh

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
because they will be aware of what's out

115
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,120
there and uh

116
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
how they can defend their applications

117
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,840
uh secondly uh it's for security

118
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
researchers uh

119
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,840
when performing audits uh they would be

120
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
able to detect uh

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
things more easily if they would be

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,639
aware of

123
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,919
again

124
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,320
what's happening in space it's for users

125
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
because uh they will be the ones that

126
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,240
will be um

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
that might be affected uh by some

128
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,160
negative aspects of the system and of

129
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
course uh we cannot exclude the

130
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,360
arbitragers that make a lot of profit

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,919
out of this using these techniques

132
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,720
so

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,520
the mev tail starts with arbitrage

134
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
basically

135
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
in the beginning uh when the blockchain

136
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
was born and um

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
we had

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,740
um

139
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,320
[Music]

140
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,039
decentralized exchanges uh someone could

141
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,840
buy

142
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,000
um a coin for some amount and sell it on

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,680
another exchange

144
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
for a bigger amount and he would be able

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,880
to pocket uh the change so to illustrate

146
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
this uh

147
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
i have the screenshots

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
of two

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
exchanges

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,120
so basically if you swap one if for avi

151
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,520
token on one website you get that amount

152
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
and if you sell that amount on a

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,800
different exchange you might get a

154
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,759
slightly more bigger amount of heat so

155
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,639
you can basically pocket the uh

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,759
difference

157
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,479
uh so in this example the gross profit

158
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,240
was

159
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,039
0.007 if uh but this was just a random

160
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,039
example that i stumbled upon it happens

161
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,600
all the time and if you monitor the

162
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,479
blockchain a lot

163
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,479
and you see these opportunities you can

164
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,039
send a transaction uh from the profit

165
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,199
you subtract the gas fee and basically

166
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,440
your pocket uh the profit

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,560
uh

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,639
it looks simple and just like that you

169
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,319
shoot your shot

170
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
and you can profit

171
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,840
um

172
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,960
of course

173
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,199
you ain't maybe not the only one that

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,080
does this and someone might outbid you

175
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,840
maybe your transaction game is the

176
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,680
second in the block and you lost money

177
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,000
or something like that or maybe it

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
you take care of uh took care of the uh

179
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
exchange for the transaction and uh had

180
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
an early exit in your contract and you

181
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,479
spend the least amount but you still

182
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,720
spend something on the fees

183
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,639
so uh

184
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,520
in order to

185
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,400
basically if you're shocked in order to

186
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
do something about it uh what you can do

187
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
is actually analyze the pool find the

188
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
taxes uh that um

189
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
want to perform the same trade i would

190
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,199
beat them in the gas price and then

191
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,000
you'll come in first and uh you'll

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,759
profit okay

193
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,880
uh

194
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,360
so what people did at that point they

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
took a look at the mempool the mempool

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,880
is a place uh that's uh memphis that

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,680
stands for memory pool and it's a pool

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
of transactions that are aren't mined

199
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
yet but are uh in the memory of the

200
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,919
nodes

201
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,680
so um

202
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,560
everyone has uh these transactions and

203
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,520
is trying to mine the next block and uh

204
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,039
the way

205
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,240
uh miners do is basically a wrench ban

206
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,879
by the gas price the first profitable uh

207
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
the first uh go into the block the most

208
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
profitable ones than the others so

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,240
whoever gets uh sends um a higher gas

210
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,240
price will be the first in the block and

211
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,199
will will win uh basically

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,919
uh this and if you monitor the mempool

213
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,759
and see another transaction that wants

214
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
to perform the same trade as you you

215
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
basically can send

216
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,240
one with higher gas and then he can see

217
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
your transaction and how it bid you

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,000
so

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,440
this is what actually led to the great

220
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,958
uh gas price wars uh of course this is

221
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,640
uh not um

222
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,679
uh

223
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,279
how it happens on the blockchain as you

224
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,040
see you can see on the screen it's just

225
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
for a little

226
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,080
illusive purposes

227
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,000
but the gas wars or how they are also

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,200
called priority gas auctions

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,760
uh happen on the public temple

230
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
and as uh

231
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,120
arbitrages send uh their transactions

232
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
when they see that and other bots have

233
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,959
sent a transaction send one with a

234
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,920
slightly higher um

235
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
gas price to outbeat them and uh this

236
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,279
goes back and forth until the block is

237
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,040
mined and then

238
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,640
they have to

239
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,600
basically fight for uh the space in uh

240
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
the next block and so on until they uh

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
as long as they have opportunities

242
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,600
uh

243
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,279
so in there was a paper on this and um

244
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,839
in the flesh voice to zero paper

245
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,519
basically there was an analysis of uh um

246
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,080
the priority gas auctions that happen on

247
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,240
chain and um

248
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
uh you can see on the screen that we

249
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,320
have

250
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,160
basically two bots

251
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,560
uh first one is uh the blue one the

252
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,080
second one is the green one and they uh

253
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,120
outbid themselves uh for uh

254
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,959
almost 14 seconds um

255
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,519
we're sending a transaction after

256
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,320
transaction uh in order to win the gas

257
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,760
war uh unfortunately for them the

258
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
competition

259
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,320
was won by the green one and it ended

260
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,200
quite early at the five seconds

261
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,640
but this thing happens and spams

262
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,600
uh a lot the network uh in order to uh

263
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,760
it has a high toll on

264
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,120
performance tall on node operators

265
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,440
uh another thing that happens on the

266
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
blockchain might maybe you have heard of

267
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,920
it but it's a sandwich attack

268
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
so it's not quite like in the picture

269
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,120
again

270
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,519
but since the transactions are in the

271
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,160
public pen pool uh for example if a user

272
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
sends a transaction

273
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,600
or with a gas price and wants to swap

274
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
one coin for the other or one token for

275
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,399
the other on some exchange

276
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,399
um

277
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
if the user sets uh a sleepage in the

278
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
transaction that's too high

279
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,519
basically

280
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,839
a sleep edge is um

281
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,800
the tolerance for the

282
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
price movement of the token and if the

283
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
users allows uh

284
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
a gap that's too big

285
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,200
then bots can come and take profit of

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
that how do they do that

287
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
uh basically

288
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,399
they see your transaction where you want

289
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,440
to buy

290
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,079
they send one um

291
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,519
with a slightly

292
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,600
higher price

293
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,120
where they uh

294
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,519
also buy the same token so they increase

295
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,040
the price

296
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,079
uh then uh your transaction happens and

297
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,639
afterwards uh they uh

298
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,279
do a second transaction when they sell

299
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,320
so uh they basically forced you to buy

300
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
the token that you intended at a higher

301
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,399
price and all that's because of the

302
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,240
slippage

303
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,079
uh in reality what happens is that bots

304
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,279
don't just add one way they spam with

305
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,600
lots of transactions

306
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
just because there are a lot of them and

307
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,399
they

308
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,440
just spam the notes in hopes uh that

309
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
they will be the one that will be picked

310
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,720
again this uh

311
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,519
has a performance tool on um uh the

312
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,480
notes

313
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,440
uh to illustrate um

314
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,279
how um

315
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,320
uh

316
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,560
again i i just saw i have illustrations

317
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,959
for all um uh the examples so to

318
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,240
illustrate

319
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,839
what a sandwich attack

320
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,920
would look like and would be

321
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,240
in a much um

322
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,480
intuitive way you can think of it like

323
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,360
this

324
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,240
basically a sell order a buy order and

325
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,560
the trades that you wanted to do but

326
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,519
your

327
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,399
uh

328
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,000
your fingers slipped and you latched the

329
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,839
slippage way too high

330
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,800
anyway if we look at the uh transaction

331
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
on the public blockchain on uh

332
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,160
on

333
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
a block explorer uh in this example i

334
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
have etherscan

335
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,079
uh you can see that uh there are two

336
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,320
transactions and one swap transactions

337
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,519
uh

338
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,760
in the middle uh the first transaction

339
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,079
is basically the buy transaction and uh

340
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,880
if we look at that you'll see uh in this

341
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
example we have the accent token i

342
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,480
haven't i never heard about it but a lot

343
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,920
of tokens out there

344
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,839
so in the first transaction the bot uh

345
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,720
uh

346
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,079
the bot uh has purchased ten thousand

347
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,680
tokens or something like that for seven

348
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
eighth seven uh

349
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
dot zero two

350
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,519
uh then came in the transaction that

351
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,680
actually uh was intended by the user and

352
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
he bought uh

353
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
the amount that he wanted and then the

354
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,720
bot came and basically uh swapped all

355
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,360
the tokens that he previously purchased

356
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
for slightly more if in this case uh it

357
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,120
was 7.10

358
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,519
so basically uh the bot uh

359
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
was able to send you the transaction and

360
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,360
extract value from it

361
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,440
and for users if you set a higher high

362
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
sleep page on your transactions you're

363
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
all mostly sure

364
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,519
get sandwiched

365
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,000
although not almost but surely get

366
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,560
sandwiched if you use this on a

367
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,600
um

368
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,360
public memo

369
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,079
uh now since the bots has uh have

370
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,360
started to send a lot of spam uh to get

371
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,160
this

372
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,959
right right and basically have uh the

373
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,199
transaction before yours and after we

374
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,279
were yours and there were a lot of

375
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,160
competition in this uh this basically

376
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
led to a lot of spam in the network

377
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,440
so

378
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,320
to prevent this there were two basic two

379
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
main ideas that helped a lot first of

380
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,600
all at private transactions so

381
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,240
if we have the regular nodes when the

382
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
user sends a transaction to the node

383
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
the node will basically broadcast that

384
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,079
transaction to all other nodes

385
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
they have a special protocol for that

386
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,800
and uh it's called whisper protocol and

387
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,959
they basically broadcast as soon as

388
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,360
possible all transactions that they get

389
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,560
and if someone wants to front front run

390
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,279
or uh sandwich that transaction he would

391
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,680
be watching the mempool that's public

392
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,000
and offer the higher the x and get in

393
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
front of the um transaction

394
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
however with the mount uh with the

395
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,880
uh private mempool in this case example

396
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,199
i have one operator taichiba that i

397
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,920
don't think works anymore

398
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,639
but we have others now we'll get to that

399
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,440
in a second so uh with a private mempool

400
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,680
if the user alice sends the same

401
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
transaction to the node that node will

402
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
not broadcast it

403
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,040
and uh frontrunners cannot um

404
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,199
observe the manpool uh because it's

405
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,240
private and they cannot frontran you so

406
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,040
that's

407
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,279
basically that basically gives you

408
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,560
private transaction where you can set uh

409
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,759
your um

410
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:10,959
slippage

411
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,440
uh in a bad way and you won't get

412
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
wrecked

413
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
uh of course this doesn't mean you can

414
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,560
just go yola on the blockchain uh these

415
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,000
transactions are almost private because

416
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
uh once it's mined

417
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,399
it will be included in the block

418
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,880
and anyone can see it so if um

419
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
uh if a rework happens um

420
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,480
basically your transaction is

421
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,680
transaction is back in the manual and uh

422
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,079
people can uh take advantage of that a

423
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,680
rework is an event where uh let's say we

424
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,040
have a chain a b c d e and then a minor

425
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,759
came in and mine on top of c

426
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,639
uh

427
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,680
uh

428
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,880
d prime e prime and the f blocks since

429
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,680
the

430
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,000
second case is a longer chain the

431
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,920
network will test that as being the

432
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,280
canonical chain

433
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
and we'll choose that

434
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,919
uh so everything that happened in b and

435
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,640
e will be back to the manpool and mind

436
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
again

437
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,240
so the second idea to um

438
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
contravene the gas price auctions and

439
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,520
all that is to basically pry the miner

440
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
uh there was

441
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,559
there's no incentive for the miner to

442
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
keep the transaction uh private uh

443
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,640
unless we bribe him to do that

444
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,919
and

445
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,840
since we are bragging him

446
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,480
we can't not only send a transaction but

447
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
we can actually send multiple

448
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,360
transactions to the miner and he will

449
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,000
keep them private no we will not

450
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
broadcast them to the other nodes and we

451
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,799
can also take advantage of this process

452
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
and uh tell the node to execute them

453
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
include them in the block in a specific

454
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,720
order

455
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
so uh this uh comes um

456
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
this brings a lot of power to the miners

457
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,039
and the people that use

458
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,160
uh those uh rpcs of those uh miners

459
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,679
uh

460
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,840
so

461
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,280
uh this is basically what uh flashbacks

462
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,559
did uh flashbots is an organization that

463
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,360
uh

464
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,000
forked gath basically and implemented

465
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,120
all this uh logic um and called the

466
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,559
client math gath

467
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,679
and most miners actually nowadays uh run

468
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,880
mathgath

469
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,720
uh because they are able to accept um

470
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,679
bundles from uh searchers such as being

471
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,840
people that said meet bundles

472
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,720
and

473
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,840
i think all the arbitrators nowadays use

474
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,320
our searchers and they're using uh

475
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
flashbots or

476
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,039
other services like this

477
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,600
and metget basically adds a new call if

478
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,960
call bundle and if send bundle

479
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,760
uh

480
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,679
to new host

481
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,840
which uh you can use the simulator

482
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,480
bundle and then submit your bundle to

483
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,880
the uh network and the miner will not uh

484
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
um

485
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,480
will not broadcast them until it's mined

486
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,679
and

487
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,919
you have the transactions in your order

488
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,919
and because you bribed the miner at the

489
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,039
end you could actually send the initial

490
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,360
transactions with uh

491
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,160
a gas price of zero so basically it was

492
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,000
free gas

493
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,760
and to take a look if you take a look at

494
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,120
the uh

495
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
number of pools that we have out there

496
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
uh basically um aside from a few

497
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,919
of them

498
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,400
most pools are running mouth gas

499
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,120
uh and they have the majority um of the

500
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,880
hash rate uh

501
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
this images uh back from may uh it might

502
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,200
have changed a bit uh spark pool is not

503
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,679
uh around anymore but

504
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,679
uh you get the idea

505
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,360
so uh

506
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,120
what's about the free gas so basically

507
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,760
if you have a transaction uh and you set

508
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,159
the uh guess price to zero and you send

509
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,000
it to a public mempool

510
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,799
no node will uh want to include that by

511
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,919
default

512
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,440
but

513
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,919
uh if you send a bundle of transactions

514
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,679
or send one specific transaction that

515
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
includes a bribe to the miner

516
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,640
uh then there's an incentive for the uh

517
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,480
nodes to include it

518
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
um

519
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,440
so basically you can use this to your

520
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,960
advantage and uh avoid uh paying for

521
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,200
reverse uh because when the reverse

522
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,679
happens if your transaction fails you'll

523
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,320
have to pay for the gas

524
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,200
um

525
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,760
but using this trick basically it's

526
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,640
free free transactions and nothing goes

527
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,520
in profit goes out

528
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,799
however this

529
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,720
this specific uh

530
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,039
free gas uh scenario didn't last for

531
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,679
long and back in august we had

532
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,840
eap

533
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,919
1559 that had

534
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,400
a goal to make the gas prices more

535
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,240
reliable uh

536
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,000
and as part of it it basically burns a

537
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
part of the fee that um

538
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,559
that the user sent instead of sending it

539
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,159
entirely to the miner

540
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,760
so you have to

541
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,799
um

542
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,200
we have much more reliable gas prices

543
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,600
now base fee is required and is burned

544
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
so that's why

545
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,880
there's a rocket out there and that's

546
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
why people call it

547
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
ultrasound money

548
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,400
because it becomes

549
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,159
or soon will become

550
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,600
deflationary

551
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,159
so more and more expensive

552
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,559
and um

553
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,919
uh you still can submit your

554
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,400
transactions but as long as uh but you

555
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,480
have to pay the base fee because that's

556
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,840
um a requirement now uh and you still

557
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,799
have to bribe the miner uh so there's an

558
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,360
incentive for the miner to

559
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
basically execute your transactions in

560
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
the order that you choose

561
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,960
and if some transaction fails uh it

562
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,720
won't be included so you don't have to

563
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,360
pay for that that's taking care of

564
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,640
flashbots

565
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,039
and to observe flashbots you can go to

566
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,760
etherscan and open a specific block and

567
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,080
almost all blocks will have this

568
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,039
uh labels flashbots and unconventional

569
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,320
ordering

570
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,039
unconventional ordering are referring to

571
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,080
the ordered order of the transactions

572
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,360
uh in the um block because they're not

573
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
uh ordered by the gas price anymore but

574
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,840
it's or just uh

575
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,760
as you said them to be and back

576
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
until august you would

577
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,640
notice this kind of transactions

578
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,760
you would have

579
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,240
a swap in the middle that pays the gas

580
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,559
fee and all that and you would have

581
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,400
two transactions one uh two other

582
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,480
transactions one before it and one after

583
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
that had down a

584
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,840
transaction fee zero

585
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,720
uh

586
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
and curiously enough opening one of

587
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,960
those you would see exactly this uh now

588
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
uh with the new flashbots you cannot get

589
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
them for free but you still have cool

590
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,320
stuff

591
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,440
so about those rescues uh as you all

592
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,919
know uh since it's crypto it's based on

593
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,120
cryptography and every wallet has

594
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,320
a private key uh or a seed phrase so

595
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,559
basically all accounts have a private

596
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,120
key that's derived output succeed phrase

597
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,159
and that's basically uh the security of

598
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,039
the wallets if you lick this

599
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,840
uh anyone will be able to

600
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,159
basically drain all the funds that uh

601
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,440
you find there

602
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,480
uh

603
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,400
good luck with the uh this set it's

604
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,640
probably drained already

605
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,159
um okay so obviously this uh creates an

606
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,240
incentive for the scammers and they

607
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,480
would basically create all kind of fake

608
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,600
uh

609
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,039
websites

610
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,120
where would they would try to trick you

611
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,720
into entering the seed words

612
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,279
and if you just happen to not pay

613
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,960
attention and

614
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,880
enter your um

615
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,919
seed

616
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:12,960
on

617
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,279
that website

618
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,120
as soon as you do that

619
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,559
it's gone

620
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,400
you don't have it anymore everything

621
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,840
that you had

622
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,039
all the

623
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,960
uh if all the tokens everything is gone

624
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,760
so

625
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,400
what happens is sometimes scammers do

626
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,120
not notice that people still have

627
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
some um

628
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,880
tokens or some amount of money or

629
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,039
something uh staked on some protocols

630
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,679
that don't show up uh in the wallet

631
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,799
itself

632
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,600
so

633
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,799
at times they will be like oh maybe they

634
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,120
didn't notice maybe i still can get it

635
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,080
back

636
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,279
and uh that's when uh people

637
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,799
are looking for uh help uh to res rescue

638
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,159
their wallets

639
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,440
uh

640
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,080
how does this happen so basically if uh

641
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,120
uh

642
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,600
a wallet is compromised all the if from

643
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
that wallet is sweeped away as soon as

644
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,880
as it arrives if you try to fund your

645
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,400
account so you can send a transaction

646
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,600
from it

647
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,320
you won't be uh able to because

648
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,720
immediately immediately as it arrives

649
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,919
it's gone

650
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,520
um

651
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,320
and if you manage to

652
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,840
um

653
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,240
basically send a transaction or

654
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,320
to fund a wallet and then send another

655
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,200
one

656
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,240
that wants to transfer the money out and

657
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,440
stake or

658
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,520
something like that

659
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
then

660
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,159
scammers might notice it and might

661
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,400
actually uh be faster than you and

662
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,720
unstake and steal the money so you have

663
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,480
to be uh

664
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,880
as quiet as possible so that's a perfect

665
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,360
use for flashbots uh where you basically

666
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,679
can create a bundle uh with a few

667
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,279
transactions first it will be the

668
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,520
funding transaction that will send if to

669
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,000
your wallet then you do all the

670
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,480
transactions that you need to unstake

671
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,159
transfer all the tokens that you have

672
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,760
there etc then you obviously have to

673
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,640
bribe the miner and you put this all in

674
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,360
a bundle send the bundle to the miner l

675
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,480
and the miner if the bribe is uh high

676
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,360
enough

677
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,039
uh will include it uh in an upcoming

678
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,640
block in the order that you specified

679
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
and

680
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,320
as soon as the block is mined you have

681
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,600
all the money and the scammers cannot do

682
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,919
anything unless there's a work of course

683
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,200
but that

684
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,960
happens not that often

685
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,799
and you can repeat the bundle in that

686
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,120
case hopefully

687
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,080
uh once you get the funds out happy a

688
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,360
happy pepper

689
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,559
um

690
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,679
so to learn more about the uh

691
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,200
mav uh you can go to the flashbots uh

692
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,200
website uh it's on github.com

693
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,760
uh you also have uh under uh on github

694
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,400
dmv it's open source anyone can

695
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
take a look at the code

696
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,799
uh

697
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
you can use um

698
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,880
the flashbots provider with ethers

699
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,520
that's on the javascript library to

700
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,360
interact with the blockchain you can

701
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,880
watch the stats about flashbots how much

702
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,600
money they uh

703
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,720
made and uh that's basically tracking

704
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,480
the um

705
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,840
math extracted and you can join their

706
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,520
discord uh to take a look around and

707
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,600
chat with them

708
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,840
so the takeaways from this presentation

709
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,480
is that miners can and will manipulate

710
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,039
the order of the transaction uh for

711
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,120
developers the takeaway should be that

712
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,480
you should not realize that um

713
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,440
the person sending the uh transaction um

714
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,520
is uh

715
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,279
not intending to do something with your

716
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,919
application uh if you have a few

717
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,720
transactions one after the other uh

718
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
they can manipulate your contract and do

719
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,919
nasty stuff

720
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,000
uh but we can uh use uh the flashbots

721
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,799
yeah mapgeth in our dimension advantage

722
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,520
as you saw before and uh

723
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,559
actually uh perform rescues and uh do

724
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,640
other stuff like adjusting time

725
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
liquidity that i didn't get to talk

726
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,120
about but we'll talk about on twitter

727
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,720
so um

728
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,159
keeping that in mind uh

729
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,760
keep calm and uh hold your up thanks so

730
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,039
much

731
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,640
uh that was really detailed and i think

732
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,200
that it it just you know inside it even

733
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,440
more curiosity into the topic that

734
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,039
people already have that's the goal

735
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,039
that is absolutely true just because

736
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,799
we're we're getting ready to wrap up

737
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,720
deathcam but i hope you'll hang on with

738
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,080
me uh for just like two more minutes i

739
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,000
wanted to ask you

740
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,120

741
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,279
what's kind of what role has def cam

742
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,360
played in in your personal journey you

743
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,480
know throughout the phases of your

744
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,440
growth in cyber security and beyond

745
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,440
well uh obviously um everywhere uh that

746
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,600
we go everywhere every field that we

747
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,120
choose it's all about people uh it's uh

748
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,200
about the people that surround us and uh

749
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,080
that will basically um we will interact

750
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,960
with and form

751
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,440
our skills and uh

752
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,760
find opportunities and talk to ensure

753
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,799
ideas uh and devcamp was the perfect

754
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,120
place to meet other security researchers

755
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,919
and uh um

756
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,919
