1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,840
so now i would like to introduce our

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,359
next guest um simona david who is a

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,360
security research engineer at keysight

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,880
technologies

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,360
she has an awesome presentation on

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,679
adversary emulation on windows i'm

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,080
really looking forward to it uh so

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,840
please uh you know give her a warm

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,240
welcome i know we can afford speakers

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,640
online which sucks

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,840
but still simona i want to uh i want you

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,800
to know

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,560
today that my energy is with you and i

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,479
bet that i am not alone so welcome to

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,840
deathcamp

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,880
hello my name is mona i am a security

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
researcher within keysight application

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,480
and threat intelligence research center

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,640
here we try to reproduce attack

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
techniques in a safe environment and we

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,600
come up with new vectors of bypassing

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
current protection mechanisms

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,800
um i very much enjoy playing in ctfs and

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,960
i suggest you enroll in the defender

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
castle competition hosted by my

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,559
colleagues

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,879
you can also find me on social media

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,040
i trust your awesome skills

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
and we can also talk in the keysight

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,840
virtual book

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
uh this presentation will focus on

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,159
adversary emulation mainly on the ways

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,479
in which we can automate and emulate the

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,880
techniques used commonly in the wild by

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,360
malicious actors we will start by

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,759
defining the terms understanding the

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,000
difference between dentisting red

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
teaming

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,600
and adversary emulation we will talk

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
about the miter framework and how we can

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,840
use it to our advantage

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
and lastly we will go through some

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,920
examples and how they were implemented

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,400
by us

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
the first term we want to define is

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
penetration testing

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
it is a simulation designed to check for

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,479
exploitable vulnerabilities its goal

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,640
being to find as many vulnerabilities in

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,479
the time allotted

51
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,880
the team has a defined scope like a web

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,840
application server or an api

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,399
and a defined time frame usually a few

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,920
weeks depending on how big the scope is

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,598
those are agreed with the customer

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,959
beforehand

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,680
usually it is limited to network or

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,239
application layer exploitation

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,239
but sometimes it involves

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,520
social engineering as well

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,239
now the next term is retaining red

62
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,319
teaming is an exercise designed to

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,560
measure how well the security controls

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,879
can withstand an attack

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,959
the goal is to test the organization's

66
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,599
detection and response capabilities the

67
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,400
scope is larger than one of the pentest

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,280
and the time frame is bigger as well

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,840
the scope is basically everything from

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,760
infrastructure to people to physical

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,959
locations

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
with a larger scope the tactics are more

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,519
uh the prosthetic social engineering

74
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,519
because with a little bit of research on

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,720
individuals and organizations

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,319
phishing emails become a lot more

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
convincing this low-hanging fruit is

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,159
frequently the first step in a chain of

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,440
attacks

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,920
that lead to the goal

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,560
network service exploitation exploiting

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,959
unpatched or misconfigured network

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,879
services can provide an attacker with

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,959
access to previously inaccessible

85
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,400
networks or to sensitive information

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,640
usually attackers will leave a backdoor

87
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
just in case they need access in the

88
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,120
future

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
but we've also seen cases where they

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
patch the system so that other competing

91
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,319
attackers will not use the same method

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,040
physical facility exploitation as with

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
social engineering attackers will choose

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,760
the weakest link humans

95
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,920
we have a natural information to avoid

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,480
confrontation thus gaining access to

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,400
secure facilities often as easy as

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,720
following someone through a door

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,360
then is the next tactic application

100
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
layer exploitation because web

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
applications are often the first thing

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
we see when researching

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,879
an organization exploiting web

104
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
application vulnerabilities like

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
cross-site scripting the scale injection

106
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
or cross-site request forgery can give

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
an attacker a foothold from which to

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,518
execute further attacks

109
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,279
adversary emulation is a part of our

110
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,519
rating simulation the goal is the same

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
to measure how well the security

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,360
controls can withstand an attack

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,520
it mimics the behavior of an attacker

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,280
because we want to make it look like a

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,600
real attack is happening while there is

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,080
no real adversary

117
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
we simulate the behavior in all the

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
stages of the attack from the

119
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,240
enumeration step to the final objective

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
being detected exfiltration of data

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,759
encryption of data whatever

122
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
their objective might be we make use of

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,560
their tactics techniques and procedures

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
to mimic their behavior as much as

125
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,000
possible

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,479
but how do we know how attackers behave

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,560
how do we know how they go undetected

128
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,160
for such long periods of time

129
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
the answer is quite simple the internet

130
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
miter is a collection of ttps used by

131
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,039
attackers

132
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,919
the mitre content is based on real or

133
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,160
world observations being a guide of

134
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,880
techniques used by attackers this allows

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,800
us to understand their behavior and

136
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
prepare our defense

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,039
the framework introduces some concepts

138
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,759
and we will go through some of them

139
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
domain refers to the enterprise mobile

140
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
or industrial control systems

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,720
domain

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,880
tactic refers to the objective of an

143
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,280
action what is the goal an example is

144
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,199
privilege escalation an attacker is

145
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,440
doing deception to gain higher level

146
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,600
privileges

147
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,039
the technique represents how the

148
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,120
tactical goal is achieved

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
an example is that adversaries may

150
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,039
establish persistence and elevate

151
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,120
privileges by executing malicious

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,160
content

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,919
triggered by windows management

154
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,720
instrumentation event subscription

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,360
mitigation represents security concepts

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,160
and

157
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,919
technologies that can be used to prevent

158
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,520
the technique from being

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,000
successfully executed

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
group refers to a set of related

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,759
intrusion activity

162
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,919
that are tracked by a common name in the

163
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,639
security community and data sources

164
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,280
represent the various subjects topics of

165
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
information that can be collected by

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,560
sensors or logs

167
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,759
this is an example of how a technique

168
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,800
looks we see that the domain is

169
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,800
enterprise

170
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
the tactic is discovery um and it it's

171
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,160
intended to work on windows we see some

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
mentions of groups and tools that make

173
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
use of this technique with some mentions

174
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,039
of windows commands like gpu result

175
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,319
let's imagine now that we work for a

176
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
healthcare company

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,479
in a very small security team

178
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,639
ideally we would have the time people in

179
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
budget to perform penetration tests on

180
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,479
our platform

181
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,039
given the high number of attacks against

182
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,120
health care companies in the last two

183
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560
years given the pandemic context

184
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,039
in reality we won't have much of that

185
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,120
and we have to make a compromise based

186
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
on threat intelligence we determine

187
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,120
which groups are most likely to target

188
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,039
our organization

189
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,759
we emulate this adversary we mimic their

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,120
ttps

191
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,080
and we test those in our environment

192
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,120
is this the perfect scenario no but it

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,400
is better than doing nothing

194
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,879
but how does the framework help me as a

195
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,720
security researcher

196
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,919
first we need to understand the

197
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,400
framework how the data is structured and

198
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,879
what terminology they introduce

199
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,720
we need to look at the bigger picture

200
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,400
why would an attacker perform this

201
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,039
action what are his goals is this action

202
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,919
malicious by default or is it malicious

203
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,840
in that chain of events

204
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,919
when we research a malware campaign we

205
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,000
can map the actions to a tactic and

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
tiffany can split each stage into

207
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,440
smaller steps

208
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
for example when a docx file is sent to

209
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,440
a user what is the usual user behavior

210
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
why would an attacker send that file are

211
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,240
we worried only because a new windward

212
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,039
process is started or is there something

213
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,039
else happening there

214
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,440
we have to be wary of our goals we

215
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,120
implement testing procedures that

216
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,599
simulate real life attacks we need to

217
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,599
have a good coverage for each technique

218
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,919
in terms of actions by improving our

219
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
coverage we improve the organization's

220
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,919
effection capabilities

221
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,000
also these testing procedures do not

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,240
include physical location tactics

223
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,519
we speak here only about things

224
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,200
that can be translated in code

225
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,839
while performing the research we start

226
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,080
by choosing a technique we have to

227
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,640
understand how attackers use this

228
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,120
technique to achieve their goals

229
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,519
and we replicate their behavior and

230
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,279
create a test procedure while

231
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
implementing

232
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
going a bit in depth i present you conti

233
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,760
which is a ransomware as a service that

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
has been used against organizations and

235
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
government agencies in north america

236
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
the sample hash mentioned here is one

237
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
recently seen in the wild

238
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
this campaign starts

239
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
with the dangerous user behavior

240
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,600
simulating the user downloading a known

241
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,680
actual malware executable from the

242
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,880
internet

243
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,200
the executable if run would quickly

244
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,880
infect the machine

245
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
shadow copies will be deleted to prevent

246
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,279
data recovery and the basic techniques

247
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,720
will be deployed to stay under the

248
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,440
reader finally the user's documents will

249
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,680
be encrypted and the ransom node will be

250
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,560
written to this

251
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,040
so we can see that the campaign started

252
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,360
with delivering the malware installing

253
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,519
it the objective being to encrypt the

254
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,120
user's data and ask for money in return

255
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,519
these three stages delivery installation

256
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,600
and objective are part of the lockheed

257
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
martin cyber kill chain represented on

258
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,279
my slide in the right side

259
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,760
the first step is reconnaissance where

260
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,040
the attacker

261
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,760
harvests information about the target

262
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,800
next we have weaponization coupling

263
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
exploited vector into deliverable

264
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
payload

265
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,360
delivery we deliver the weaponized

266
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,279
bundle to the victim

267
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
exploitation

268
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,120
the attacker exploits a vulnerability on

269
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
the victim system

270
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
installation is a stage where the

271
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,680
malware gets installed

272
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,920
command and control represents a channel

273
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
for remote manipulation of the victim

274
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,720
and the objectives

275
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
is a step where the attackers achieve

276
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,119
their goals

277
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,600
going deeper we break each stage of the

278
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,680
quantity campaign into smaller actions

279
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,519
and for each action we find a

280
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,079
representative in the lighter framework

281
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,240
the delivery part is straightforward the

282
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
campaign begins with dangerous user

283
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,959
behavior simulating a user downloading a

284
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,200
non-actual malware executable from the

285
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,240
internet

286
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
corresponding to

287
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,000
zero t12040 one miter sub technique

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
which is user a

289
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,760
execution malicious link

290
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
the insulation part is more complex

291
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,360
because the mother does the following

292
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,320
things

293
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,399
employs various anti-debug and

294
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
anti-analysis techniques and enumerate

295
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,360
and delete shadow copies for each step

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,440
observed in the execution we assign a

297
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,399
miter technique for subtechnical

298
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,320
the objective part is represented by

299
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,680
data encryption corresponding to t

300
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,959
1486 technique data encrypted for impact

301
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,079
we translated all these steps into

302
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,399
actions and we can simulate the chain of

303
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,639
events from the model being downloaded

304
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,839
to the data encryption

305
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
we run the simulation against the

306
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,880
windows setup and we see that all

307
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,040
actions are allowed

308
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
meaning that our security controls on

309
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
that setup fail to protect us against

310
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,880
this attack now we know that

311
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
mitigation's actions have to be employed

312
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,639
to make sure that we can prevent such

313
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,279
attacks from happening in the future

314
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,959
the sooner the chain of events is

315
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,000
interrupted the better

316
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
we've talked about the three stages and

317
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,399
the actions in each of them let's dive

318
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,320
deeper into one of the installation

319
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,399
steps represented by t

320
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,519
1082 system information discovery

321
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
from our research the malware calls get

322
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,800
to wmi object

323
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,920
using the win32 shadowcopy class

324
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,720
this class is a storage extent

325
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,000
that represents a duplicate copy of the

326
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
original volume at the previous time

327
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,120
this installation step uses swin32

328
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
shadow copy to retrieve the shadow

329
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,479
copies available on the system

330
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
when running this step against our setup

331
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,360
we see that the execution is allowed

332
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
that our security controls fail to

333
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
prevent this from happening it's true

334
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,279
that nothing reaction is by default

335
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,839
malicious but it has to be correlated

336
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,360
with other events on the setup

337
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
now we will see what our test procedure

338
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
does on the windows machine

339
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,040
when we run the test procedure from a

340
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,760
linux vm to windows vm just for distinct

341
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,320
purposes switch it out we will see that

342
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
our previous command

343
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
will get executed and a new file will be

344
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,079
created in a temp folder

345
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,160
we just run the attack from our linux vm

346
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,120
to the windows vm we see that some steps

347
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,839
are being performed on the windows vm we

348
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,519
will talk about these steps later

349
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,760
and we see that our command gets

350
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,440
executed the get w my object class

351
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
um win32 shadow copy and the new file

352
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,120
named shadow copies was created in the

353
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,440
temp folder

354
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,199
but calling get wmi object using the

355
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,839
win32 shadow class is just an example of

356
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,000
how system information discovery can be

357
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
achieved other tools and commands can be

358
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,320
used to gather this type of data for

359
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,480
example system setup

360
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
can be used to gather

361
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
this type of data

362
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
on macro systems

363
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,639
and it will display system data when

364
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,199
running privileged access

365
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,440
also infrastructure as a service cloud

366
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
providers allow access to instance in

367
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
virtual machines

368
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,720
um

369
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,399
virtual machine information via apis

370
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,600
system

371
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
info is a tool that can be used to

372
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,760
display os version as well as

373
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,160
information on the system configuration

374
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,120
bias motherboard and processor

375
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
by using this technique the attacker is

376
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,360
trying to learn about the environment in

377
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,199
an attempt to plan its next malicious

378
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,199
activity payload development and

379
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,959
concealment

380
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
as i've already said these commands

381
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,720
should not be viewed in isolation they

382
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,959
are not malicious by default and they

383
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,839
are part of a chain of monishes actions

384
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,279
so events on those windows machines or

385
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,720
machines in general have to be

386
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
correlated

387
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,079
when researching a technique we start by

388
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,000
inspecting the miter page going through

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,839
all the commands and tools mentioned

390
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,320
there because the framework summarizes

391
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,240
which tools were used by which threat

392
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,560
detectors we have to know if the tools

393
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,800
are present by default on the system if

394
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
the commands are

395
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,959
native os commands and we have to test

396
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,880
everything and see how the execution

397
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,279
goes after one command is successful we

398
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,680
have to ask ourselves what changed on

399
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,120
the system

400
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,199
for example was there any change in

401
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,560
registries was there any file created

402
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
this will help us in two ways first

403
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,360
cleaning up we cannot run at this

404
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,440
procedure against the machine and leave

405
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,120
the machine that stayed we have to

406
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,600
restore it to its initial state

407
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,240
if so if a registry is modified because

408
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,399
of our issued command at the end of the

409
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,959
execution we have to restore the

410
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,560
registry to its

411
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,240
initial value

412
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,399
if a file is created we have to delete

413
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,519
it

414
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,839
and second the changes in that machine

415
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
state can represent an indicator of

416
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,480
compromise

417
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,079
for our next demo we will

418
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,759
introduce t1221 template injection

419
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,240
technique we'll see how we thanks er

420
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,199
thanks for sticking around with us uh we

421
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,160
had a minor mishap but uh as demos

422
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,679
always go

423
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,760
it was not the demo's fault though uh

424
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,480
but still we're back and simona uh take

425
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,000
it away

426
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,160
yeah thank you as always the demogods

427
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,480
are not with us

428
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,039
so back to our demo

429
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,000
we will introduce t1221 complete

430
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,880
injection uh we will see how opening uh

431
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,200
docx file will result in removal called

432
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,960
execution on the widow's pm

433
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,720
before beginning let's talk about the

434
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
threat simulator terminology in our case

435
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,679
each utes procedure is called anode

436
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
each audit performs a

437
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,918
series of

438
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,200
steps of prerequisites executor and

439
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,000
cleanup in the prerequisite step we

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
account for only the tools files and

441
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
settings in order to restore the value

442
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,640
of a registry for example we have to

443
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,799
know its state before running the audit

444
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,960
and we have to save it as well but the

445
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,320
execute

446
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,039
the

447
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,799
executor part

448
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,960
accounts for the malicious actions like

449
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,240
modifying

450
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
the registry and the cleanup part

451
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,480
restores

452
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,039
the initial settings if something was

453
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,240
modified

454
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,280
during the execution

455
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,600
we have to bring it back to its state

456
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,240
before execution if a file was created

457
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,559
we have to delete it if a process has

458
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,960
been created we need to stop it

459
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,200
now back to our demo where we will talk

460
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,080
about t1221 template injection

461
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,640
microsoft office is

462
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,360
the default

463
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,200
application for a doc suit is a favorite

464
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,039
vectoring market from

465
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,559
adversaries to gain initial food food

466
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,760
hold in a network

467
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,039
through social engineering there can be

468
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,240
manipulating through and selling

469
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,039
security fronts to enable macros leading

470
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
to remote

471
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,840
code execution

472
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
office open xml is a simple format for

473
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,760
office documents that replaces all their

474
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,200
binary formats like dot

475
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,240
no pivot

476
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,039
okay so the template inside the don't

477
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,280
expand resources and can be abused to

478
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,559
execute this code from the internet

479
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,640
while the

480
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
document is being loaded

481
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,000
this audit are secure user behavior to

482
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
enable editing

483
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,720
and

484
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
macros upon opening a microsoft office

485
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,799
document

486
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,840
and executing

487
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,600
just code while loading the document

488
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,440
create the insecure user behavior we

489
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,679
have to account for

490
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,559
all the steps and use

491
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,840
the root take so our

492
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,600
this procedure performs the following

493
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,960
steps it will copy a docx file to the

494

501
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,880
to load the malicious template that will

this recording shows this integer works

508
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,520
as you expected we will see the files

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,080
opens a file and the template inside the

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,640
documents

517
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,720
will try and load malicious code nginx

518
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,240
container on my linksheet

519
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,400
the code will open the

520
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,280
calculator for windows sphere

521
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,480
this is just the purpose point

522
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,440
so i started the attack against the

523
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
windows machine

524
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
here we had some

525
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,520
that calculator file

526
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,880
was added

527
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
in the downloads folder

528
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
now that word is

529
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,960
opened and we will

530
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,320
see the calculator process being created

531
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
each audit produces indicators of

532
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,159
compromise in our case an indicator that

533
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,320
the audit was executed successfully is a

534
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,400
calculated process starting after the

535
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,799
word document is opened this ensures

536
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,520
that the insecure behavior was simulated

537
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,760
correctly and the remote code execution

538
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,000
happens

539
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
this audit will produce also windows

540
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,520
event logs in microsoft windows system

541
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
operation

542
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,400
uh in the first event we see that

543
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,360
a new windward process is created where

544
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,760
it will open the doorkicks file

545
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,840
then we notice a network connection to

546
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,640
our nginx container where the template

547
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
will be loaded and lastly we see a new

548
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,039
process being created for the calculator

549
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,840
app

550
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,480
now for the conclusions um

551
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,799
fantastic returning and adversary

552
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,000
emulation

553
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
are all great it

554
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,240
just depends on what your goals are some

555
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,159
governing authorities require paint this

556
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,720
thing such as socks and hipaa um i

557
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,039
recently read this blog post where the

558
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,360
author compared penetration testers to

559
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,640
pirates and

560
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,039
red teams with ninjas and i think this

561
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,919
is very accurate it is useful in certain

562
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,039
situations and you wouldn't want one to

563
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,360
perform the actions of the other

564
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
this fighter framework is a collection

565
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,320
of real-world adversary behavior

566
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,880
but we can use those for emulating their

567
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,280
behavior the level of vibration depends

568
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,679
on the organization not every company

569
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,400
has already ready to test their defenses

570
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,480
if we are a small company we can start

571
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,799
by researching the threat actors and the

572
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,760
techniques the user they used against

573
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,720
organizations like our own if we already

574
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,600
have operating capabilities we can map

575
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,360
our procedures to the meter framework

576
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,679
and get a view of our coverage

577
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,640
what

578
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
are we missing in our

579
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,120
writing engagements discovery is built

580
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,679
over time in techniques for windows

581
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,760
platforms and recently we started

582
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,480
researching techniques for mac

583
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,039
mac os and linux

584
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,919
systems we also pay attention to how the

585
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,080
framework changes what new techniques

586
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,559
are added because we want to constantly

587
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,799
improve our coverage

588
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,200
this was my presentation i hope you

589
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,400
enjoyed it

590
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,960
thank you so much simona uh and thank

591
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,200
you for breathing through the technical

592
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,320
issues that we had uh unfortunately like

593
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,640
there was an internet outage which as i

594
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,440
wrote on the chat is actually you know a

595
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,600
good opportunity to remind ourselves why

596
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,440
we're all trying to contribute to

597
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
defending it and keeping it stable so

598
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,159
that we may be able to share these

599
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,360
things and work together and uh you know

600
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,640
do do our work the best that we can

601
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,159
i have a quick question for you um

602
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,880
what's the best part about working in

603
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,720
cyber security research for you

604
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,720
personally

605
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,760
can you still hear me simona

606
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,360
or am i a bit delayed

607
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,200
for me it's the

608
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,360
each day

609
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,000
novelty

610
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,720
the fact that

611
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,840
i

612
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,120
get to do what i like and learn from it

613
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,960
and

614
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,799
oh yeah now i can

615
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,559
yeah so for me today is the novelty and

616
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,679
the fact that i get to do what i enjoy

617
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,279
and i get to

618
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,320
work with amazing people that like the

619
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,960
same things that i do and i feel like

620
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,320
this community

621
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,360
is

622
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,159
at least in romania is

623
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,799
a small community and we kind of each

624
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,400
known

625
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
the other teams and

626
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,520
um

627
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
i don't know it's just

628
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,199
i'm happy to do what i like

629
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,559
i think that's that's uh really you know

630
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,559
really helpful to know and yes people

631
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,200
make all the difference that's why this

632
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,360
conference is all about the people and

633
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
their work their passion their

634
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,200
commitment and how everything comes

635
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,720
together so thank you so much for uh

636
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,200
your presentation and for sharing

637
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,640
all of this with us um

638
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,919
i think that uh i wanted to

639
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
take just a quick chance between

640
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,559
presentations to go just a little bit

641
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,880
into maintenance mode to make sure that

642
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,679
the sound doesn't come through to to

643
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,760
everyone watching with tiny issues and

644
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,320
that we're fully back on track before we

645
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,039
move on to the next presentation so uh

646
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,520
tech team could we go to maintenance on

647
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,600
on track one please just for a little

648
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,760
bit

649
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,320
and thank you simona once again i hope

650
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
you enjoyed the rest of the day uh and

651
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,840
again thanks for braving through the

652
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,240
presentation will be report is recorded

653
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,880
and will be live on the youtube channel

654
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,520
um deathcamps youtube channel so there's

655
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,240
a chance to like see it end to end again

656
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,000
and dig into it uh once it's live there

657
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,559
thank you
