security so here's what you can expect

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,960
today and tomorrow so there are two

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,040
briefing stages with

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,119
really interesting technical

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,200
presentations and presentations on other

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,360
topics as well so there's track one and

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,680
track two and i encourage you to explore

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
them as much as you can

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,479
each day before um the lunch break we

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,560
will have some panel discussions with

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,360
industry experts on both tracks there

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,520
are some very interesting topics there

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,280
that i hope you'll have a chance to

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,479
explore this is you know an opportunity

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,240
to share

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
what we've all learned in the past two

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,880
years and kind of you know

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,119
be able to air out everything that we've

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,240
been working on and thinking of

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,719
throughout all of these changes

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,759
so obviously as you know the road to

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,320
becoming a cyber security expert is

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
paved not only with constant learning

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,639
but also with a lot a lot of practice so

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,280
that means that we've created a special

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
virtual hacking village for you this

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
year there are 12 competitions which are

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,959
incredibly exciting and very challenging

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,760
and i hope you have a chance to try them

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
there are the traditional type of

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,080
competitions like the iot village

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,040
powered by demons as well as many other

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,599
new ones so i hope you'll have a chance

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,480
to

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,879
explore them to try your hand at them

64
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,800

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,959
for many of us and we're here to

79
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,440
remember the good old days and create

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,519
some new memories as well and then spend

81
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,680

106
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,279
of other things such as automatic

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,798
exploitation

108
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,918
um

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,839

00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
solarwinds and what happened there

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,880
and a bunch of other interesting

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
types of research

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
that

114
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,160
will hopefully expand your views and

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,639
kind of enrich your experience as well

116
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,560
maybe they'll give you a new rabbit hole

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
to go down on

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,320
over the next few days

119
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960
obviously we're very thankful to have a

120
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,520
wonderful lineup of speakers

121
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,759
so you can also get in touch with them

122
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,280
you can send them a message on the

123
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,400
platform you can connect with them uh

124
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
ask them questions they're always very

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
friendly and even though you can't you

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,000
know

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
approach them in a coffee break as we

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,440
used to do uh in 2019 that doesn't mean

129
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,800
that they're not open to new

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
conversations so don't be shy

131
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,120
obviously

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
deaf camp is a community event and that

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,800

please that you can see my uh my slide

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
just to set the framework you mentioned

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,759
about connect and reconnect yes i

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,120
remember 2019 the last physical uh shape

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
of the event

175
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,280
and uh the focus was on connect and

176
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,800
inspire and i uh i still i i kept the

177
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
the the statement is just that now we

178
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,680
reconnect and we inspire

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
so uh

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
as

181
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,599
as um during the past the first years of

182
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,280
dev camp between 2011 and 2014

183
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
the number of participants were around

184
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
plus 1400

185

189
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,840
in 2015 and since then we saw an

190
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,919
increase in the number of participants

191
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,400
as you can see in the in the figures

192
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,840
year by year

193
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,639
and

194
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,319
death camp building time a global

195
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,160

used a nice picture from 2019 we know

204
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,400
what happened then uh so the numbers

205
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
were uh incredibly high incredibly high

206
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
so it was more than 2 000 people uh with

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
in the bracket you see the let's say

208
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
that they invited from uh from what

209
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
