1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,879
is a talk that's all about demystifying

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,000
something that we often shroud in legend

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
being a bug bounty hunter

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,440
all we hear about is the big payouts or

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,000
the big conflicts within the field

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,239
success we say is down to luck or a

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,359
stroke of inspiration but is it really

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,680
robert vulpe is a bug bounty hunter

lot of bug bounty hunting

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,680
um

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,640
so a bit of history right now i'm a

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
full-time bug bounty hunter i've been um

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,799
i've been like this for i think

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
four months already but i've been doing

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,360
this on the side for the last uh

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,320
three years or something and i will talk

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,040
all about the financial aspects at uh

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,680
almost at the end of this i i've

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,479
reported over 300 vulnerabilities on

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,320
different background programs to

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,720
different companies i found bugs in

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
amazon in paypal and goldman sachs epic

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,320
games bad ferry and a lot of companies i

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,799
can't talk i can really talk about

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,680
um

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,400
i've been awarded forbes 30 under 30 for

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,880
cyber security and

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,799
this is uh this is a story that's really

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,840
close to my heart that but um somewhere

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,079
at 10 years old i think i found my first

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,600
it wasn't really the first vulnerability

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,119
that i found it was

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,040
but it was a really interesting one

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,119
because i was playing a lot of world of

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,640
warcraft on private servers and in

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,040
in one of the in the server that i was

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,240
playing like

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
i was already playing for three or four

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,680
months i was really invested in that

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,639
game and that server and uh

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,800
i thought maybe maybe i'm checking out

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,840
the part where i can donate stuff where

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,800
i

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
well i can

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,080
give money to this private server and

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,800
they'll get me a donation

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,280
it was some donation gear it was really

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
well it was a lot better than what you

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,520
get in the game and playing around with

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,280
that i found an in-school injection and

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,720
i was able to

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,840
practically give myself an uh donation

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,040
gear and from that age i didn't i didn't

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,760
actually do that i um

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,120
i told admin i uh asked i sent him an

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,840
email with well i found this this is

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
really bad you should fix it and he

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,440
kind of contracted me for fixing it and

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,599
making it making it better it was really

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,200
cool

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
um so let's begin with bug bounties

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,159
well

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,800
bug bounty hunting is not an illegal

78
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,440
activity it's

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,159
an activity where companies

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,879
kind of allow you to hack in their in

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,120
their scope and i'll talk a bit about

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,040
that because their policy is really

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,480
important and they pay a lot of money

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
for this it depends on the company but

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
for example the company that the

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
companies that i listed here really care

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,319
about their securities so they will be

88
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,080
they will be paying you if you find

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
something important

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,040
um

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,159
so

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,080
let's go to

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
well

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,319
this bug bounty hunting it's um

95
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,080
it's kind of a passion for me because um

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,159
i'm really i'm really passionate about

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,680
this security stuff i'm really

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,640
passionate about finding interesting big

99
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,799
vulnerabilities and um

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,879
before because before going into

101
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
security i was

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
i was

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
doing programming i was a coder for

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,640
seven years i think and um

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,040
the thing is it's it was it really

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,680
fascinated me how do i make or build

107
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
this stuff and now i'm really fascinated

108
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,238
about what was the thinking process of

109
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,040
the person that built this uh this

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,519
application this framework how

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,880
how did they manage to introduce this so

112
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,360
some of the vulnerabilities that

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,759
really got me interested in bug bounty

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
hunting because at first it was really

115
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,680
the these write-ups and um

116
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
the bounty amounts that i was seeing

117
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,400
because that's that's what got me on

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,040
this path it was i was seeing a bounty

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
for ten thousand dollars a bounty for

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
two thousand dollars so for example this

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
one from orange is extremely interesting

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
the way he got he got a remote code

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,040
execution and it was this was in the

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,960
early days of background hunting so

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
companies weren't

126
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,639
really paying that much attention

127
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,240
another one is the

128
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,520
is a bug in counter strike 1.6 which is

129
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
which is really cool that

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,840
the thing is but um for a lot of people

131
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
bug money hunting

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,280
only means web vulnerabilities so that's

133
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
that's what i want to emphasize here

134
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,680
that some companies especially gaming

135
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,320
companies will pay for vulnerabilities

136
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,240
in their software in their actual

137
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
applications

138
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,800
uh going forward

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
there's this uh there was a

140
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,120
vulnerabilities in in counter-strike go

141
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,520
which um

142
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,840
which led to a remote execution

143
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,160
and this wasn't really bad because you

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,400
know you can have the map and someone

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
will join your server

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,479
um another one

147
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,759
involve

148
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,840
it was an sql injection

149
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,120
and um

150
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
dawn on the

151
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,160
right and kind of down um

152
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
it was in

153
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
rockstar games and

154
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,039
he

155
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,440
uh the hacker that found this was able

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,720
to um

157
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
well what was able to introduce any

158
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,520
emblem in the

159
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,080
uh grand theft auto 5 game

160
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,759
and with that

161
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,560
he was able to get local file inclusion

162
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,880
and srf

163
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,759
um

164
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,000
this one from uber it's

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,280
ultra interesting the way that this um

166
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
this hacker was able to get a contact

167
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,479
cover

168
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,759
and uh yeah so

169
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,120
i

170
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,919
this

171
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,160
this is a part that got me really really

172
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,400
interested in bug bounty hunting

173
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,120
so

174
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,280
the motivation why would somebody why

175
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,840
would you want to do this so or why do i

176
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,440
want to

177
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,160
would why do i want to hack companies

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280
that from whenever from

179
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
whatever part of the internet well the

180
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,039
first part is

181
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,520
if you're doing this full time you can

182
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,080
actually work from anywhere because

183
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
these companies

184
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,919
these companies will pay you based on

185
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,440
your skill will pay based on the

186
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,919
vulnerabilities that you find and

187
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,199
nothing

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,360
nothing else is important it's important

189
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
the impact that you can probably that

190
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
you can prove to this company

191
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,560
um

192
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,280
you will develop a specific specific

193
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,319
skill set because um

194
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,560
well bug bounty hunting is um

195
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,240
doing this all a lot will allow you to

196
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
be always on the edge of technology

197
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,160
because

198
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,520
every older bug will be uh every older

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
bug if you're the older bad class will

200
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,720
kind of be automated will people will

201
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,639
start to find it in

202
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,599
from the from an external perspective uh

203
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,840
we'll start to find it with automation

204
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
but on the other side they'll start to

205
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,840
find it in their in their code with

206
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,800
things like code qr now but

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
there will always be a new way their

208
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,240
lives will always be a new bug so you

209
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
will essentially be on the edge of

210
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,280
technology you'll essentially find new

211
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,319
ways to hack you

212
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,879
and this this really keeps me motivated

213
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,000
it's really interesting um the community

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
is really tight and uh

215
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
i have a slight specific for that but

216
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,440
the people the people in this community

217
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,759
are really really interesting they have

218
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,840
a great sense of humor they're they're

219
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,399
really really cool

220
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
um well for me i always wanted to be a i

221
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,479
were so i wanted to learn hacking and i

222
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,640
always wanted to do this as a kind of a

223
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
job

224
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,959
um

225
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,600
so training with real companies

226
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,360
you're actually doing that because

227
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
you're hacking whatever you want

228
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040
training for ctfs

229
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
and the

230
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,760
nice part i think because

231
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,160
the thing is this doesn't um

232
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
you're not required to have over 18

233
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
you're not required to have a

234
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,920
certification you're not required to

235
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,480
even finish high school or college it's

236
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,839
not important

237
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,560
as long as you can find the resources to

238
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,279
develop a better skill a

239
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,440
good skill to find vulnerabilities and

240
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,839
as long as you can find creative ways to

241
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,760
find vulnerabilities you don't need any

242
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,959
of that

243
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
the only thing that proves your

244
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,480
ability is your skill and the and the

245
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,360
bugs that you found find

246
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,959
um so

247
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,760
my kind of my race beam

248
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,120
how how do i get started um there are

249
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,080
more bug bounty platforms than these

250
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,320
ones but these ones are the principal

251
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,160
ones and these ones are the

252
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,279
are public so you can just

253
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
register a hacker one and

254
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,920
you can make your account and you'll be

255
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
able to access a lot of companies that

256
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,160
have a public background program

257
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,279
um

258
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,079
some other companies can do that so this

259
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,920
should be the main one i recommend

260
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,480
looking at each one of these because

261
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,839
companies

262
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,399
work with different bug bounty programs

263
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,200
so

264
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,720
you might find a company working with

265
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,480
hacker one but another company working

266
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,600
with buck crowd so depending on which

267
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,279
company you want to hack

268
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,160
you

269
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,600
because you might be interested in

270
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,000
hacking well i want you might be saying

271
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
i want just to hack this company so

272
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,560
you'll be finding that on one of these

273
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,279
companies one of these platforms

274
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,640
um

275
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,200
my recommendation so

276
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,720
these background platforms have a way of

277
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,640
incentivizing their community and

278
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,600
building up their community so

279
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
my recommendation is to stick with just

280
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,519
one

281
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,800
platform

282
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,040
and

283
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
diversify the programs that you hack on

284
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,720
but stick with just one company because

285
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
they will have a lot of ways to

286
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,839
incentivize your after you get

287
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,279
after you

288
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,760
pass a certain threshold after you get

289
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,160
better after they start to notice you

290
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,360
they'll have ways to incentivize you by

291
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,959
sending private invites your way by

292
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,800
well

293
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
getting you getting you in closer in

294
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,839
with some community some community parts

295
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
of there or just by know

296
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,440
knowing more people on the platform

297
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,399
that's

298
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,200
incredibly important because no more

299
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
people or

300
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,440
getting more private invites you this

301
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,480
will start compounding so

302
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,959
even if your first month you're not

303
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,720
gonna make anything even if your second

304
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,800
month you're not gonna make anything it

305
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,720
will start to

306
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,440
get better and better by the compounding

307
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
effect my recommendation but because

308
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,600
this is how i started this hacker one

309
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,279
because they have some instantly while

310
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,360
they have some perks for newcomers

311
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
is to go on hackaron

312
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
so there are two types of programs

313
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
you have public programs so for example

314
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,480
paypal

315
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,000
yahoo is public uh amazon is public i

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,639
think there are a lot of public programs

317
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,600
but there are a lot more private

318
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,880
programs

319
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,040
uh well

320
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,800
there are apps

321
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,240
there are ups and downs there are

322
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,399
pleasant news for each

323
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,440
type of each type of program because if

324
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000
you go on a public program

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,760
you'll have a bigger scope

326
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,600
you have

327
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
a lot of times there are higher payouts

328
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,360
on the public programs

329
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,320
and

330
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,040
the bugs are more rare and something i

331
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
noticed is that

332
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
a lot of people

333
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
there are there isn't that much

334
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
competition on the public programs

335
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,399
because uh

336
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,480
everyone is everyone is thinking that

337
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
because it's public they uh

338
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,279
all the bugs were found or something

339
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
like that but the developers on these

340
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,760
public programs because there are these

341
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,639
huge programs you think facebook

342
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,959
facebook is pop is pushing code every

343
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,440
day is pushing a lot of code every day

344
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,480
so

345
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,360
you will find a lot of things you'll

346
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,639
find a lot of interesting stuff

347
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
on the other side there are private

348
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,519
programs

349
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,639
uh usually the payouts are not that

350
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,160
satisfying but

351
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,839
uh the targets might be fresher uh

352
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,920
not that many people might have looked

353
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,000
at at this private

354
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
private programs

355
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
my um

356
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,199
my secret recipe for getting started for

357
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,480
getting started on hack one

358
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,600
is to get started with the hacker runs

359
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,519
hacker101 ctf

360
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,600
uh because this ctf is

361
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,360
well is really

362
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
put together because they were they made

363
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,279
this for real-world vulnerabilities they

364
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,680
made this for um

365
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,920
for staff that is usually found in real

366
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,199
real programs so this is not like some

367
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,680
ctf that somebody thought about about

368
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,160
the really hard program problem that's

369
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,320
really corner case no on the hacker one

370
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,040
one one there are really real world

371
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,240
challenges

372
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,120
um

373
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,040
so if you do

374
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,639
the first two or three challenges you'll

375
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
get one private invite if you do all the

376
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,040
challenges you'll get 10 private team

377
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,920
rights

378
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,399
if you accept all of them

379
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,279
you will have those 10 private programs

380
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,639
and you can start hacking in this um

381
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,639
in this private in these private

382
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,480
programs in this companies

383
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,519
uh

384
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
what i did to get started i hacked on

385
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,880
each one of these private programs that

386
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,440
i got at first so this was

387
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
almost three years ago but i hacked on

388
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
each one of this for one week i spent

389
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
all my time thinking of all these

390
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,279
different scenarios that i can

391
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
prove an impact to the clients of the

392
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,199
company that i'm hacking

393
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,519
and sometimes you get nothing sometimes

394
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
you get really low vulnerabilities but

395
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
sometimes you get something

396
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,199
you get that

397
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,639
that really interesting vulnerability so

398
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,279
get enough of those and you'll get more

399
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,040
private invites and it's a upward spiral

400
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,240
that keeps pushing and pushing um

401
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,120
it's important to read the policy uh i

402
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,920
said that before we'll get to that slide

403
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
and um

404
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,160
at first i recommend following a hacking

405
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,680
methodology because well

406
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,279
mostly at first i didn't know what i was

407
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,560
doing i was all over the place so

408
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,959
something more structured will help you

409
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:51,839
find

410
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
a few vulnerabilities at first will

411
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,759
get you the first few wins and that will

412
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,199
start

413
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
that will start getting you the

414
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
motivation that you need

415
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,880
so the policy

416
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,639
well

417
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,440
it's

418
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,639
important

419
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,720
it's important that you know that what

420
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,839
you what you hack on so you will look at

421
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,240
a policy to see what are the rewards

422
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
which is

423
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,320
kind of important at first it isn't but

424
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,240
it will get important after the first

425
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,519
six uh

426
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,959
10 months on

427
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
on hacking

428
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
and you

429
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,000
will see what types of vulnerabilities

430
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
what type of nervous is this company

431
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,199
interested in

432
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,000
what's the actual scope because

433
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
you will find a lot of

434
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
for example paypal you will find a lot

435
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
of

436
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,040
sites that are owned by people

437
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,000
but

438
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,360
a lot of them

439
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,759
which will be marketing websites

440
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,759
they are

441
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,759
they are putting them in a lower bracket

442
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,800
of payment so of bounties so they

443
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,600
wouldn't be that interesting to look at

444
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,759
you really need to check the policy to

445
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,279
make sure that your time is worth uh

446
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,000
spend so your time is really bent where

447
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,959
um

448
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:09,919
so

449
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,919
for my hacking methodologies what i

450
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,359
recommend to do

451
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,640
at first when getting started with this

452
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,799
i i do a lot of basketing it's

453
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,039
a lot it's everywhere i

454
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,720
have a lot of

455
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,520
uh a lot of sorts of those quads a lot

456
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,640
of pipes etcetera um

457
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
so stop domain discovery screenshots

458
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,240
directory discovery and after that

459
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,840
manual testing

460
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,120
over the assets that you find

461
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,840
the first um subdominant discovery in

462
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,520
screenshot you they'll allow you to find

463
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,160
them if you're hacking a wild card

464
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
a wildcard scope there are on these

465
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,799
programs you'll find some programs that

466
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,919
only allow you to hack on www

467
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,200
just to

468
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,080
skip those programs but don't tell them

469
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,799
because if you have a wild if you have a

470
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,919
wild card domain it's easier for you to

471
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,679
hack for a longer time

472
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,600
and hacking along a longer time will

473
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,120
allow you to find

474
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,520
more and more about the company if you

475
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
start understanding the processes that

476
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
the company the process is inside the

477
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
company if you start understanding how

478
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,799
their developers build code you

479
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,280
will be able to compound more and more

480
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,200
you will be able to find

481
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
more vulnerabilities by just knowing how

482
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,400
they think so if you only have one

483
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,039
domain on that drive on that program

484
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,000
it's

485
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,039
a lot harder to compound than this

486
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,440
so my suggestion is always go for the

487
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,760
wildcard domains

488
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,480
uh

489
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,880
doing this you doing the screenshotting

490
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,679
you'll find everything you can about us

491
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,000
the asset of the company

492
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,200
um

493
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
for the subdomain for subdomain

494
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,760
discovery there are two ways i

495
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,120
preferably go with the passive way

496
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,799
which means that you i will use amaz

497
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,880
on the passive mode find domain and

498
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,039
software which are both passive

499
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,960
um

500
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,360
but if the company is really smaller if

501
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,039
it's a new company

502
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,880
i would go for the

503
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
brute forcing so

504
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
for the brute force this is a really

505
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,520
neat trick but this tool your pure dns

506
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,840
is incredibly good at brush forcing

507
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,120
subdomains

508
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,160
um

509
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,320
and for screenshotting i use aquaton

510
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
it's enough fighting

511
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,799
uh and

512
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,600
another thing here if the asset is less

513
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,440
than 20 or 30 sub domains that well if i

514
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,679
find less than 20 sub domains i just

515
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,080
open them all in the browser and look at

516
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,320
each one of them

517
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,799
so directory discovery

518
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,799
this is uh

519
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,919
this is just for finding if you um

520
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,159
if the um if the asset has some hidden

521
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,720
some hidden files some hidden content i

522
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,360
will be brute forcing for um for the

523
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,720
first assets and if the um

524
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,960
these events if there are new apis with

525
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,600
node.js or stuff like that this will

526
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,400
kind of not work but if you're on older

527
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
and or older

528
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,039
if you run i don't think the older is

529
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,200
the right way to put it but if you're on

530
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,000
the

531
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,400
nginx or a past kind of

532
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,320
websites you will

533
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,559
you'll be able to find some directories

534
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,720
and with these directors they will

535
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,799
kind of point you that you have another

536
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,200
direct that that's a directory and do it

537
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,720
redirect you from not slash to slash and

538
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
it's an interesting way to go deeper and

539
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,440
deeper in finding um

540
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,360
in finding some content

541
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,000
with this method i found a few

542
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,480
vulnerabilities that just files that

543
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,559
were not supposed to be there

544
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,280
uh google docking will help

545
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,799
there are

546
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,679
well kind of you just put site and the

547
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,919
domain and you'll see a lot about the

548
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,280
site and

549
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,039
also if they

550
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,600
if they're using php or java or

551
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,039
something you'll

552
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,840
be looking out for these

553
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,640
extensions um

554
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
i suggest looking at the web r has two

555
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
there are some tools for that it's uh

556
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,720
some is get all the relays from um

557
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
i think it's corbin lee on github it's a

558
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
really good tool

559
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,200
um and from brood for director bruce

560
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,039
farsing um

561
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,039
ffuf is

562
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,880
really really good

563
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,559
i mean is that i think he's the best

564
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,880
store you can use burp intruder to from

565
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,679
some on and off things and uh

566
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,240
right now this kite runner is kind of

567
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,159
interesting but i haven't had the chance

568
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,919
to use it

569
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,039
so the fun part the part that i was that

570
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,640
i'm really excited about is

571
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
understanding the application so you

572
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
will be understanding this the

573
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,960
application only using purp suit

574
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,000
here with burst it you'll be able to

575
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
um

576
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,039
see all the traffic be able to repeat

577
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,480
some of the traffic

578
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,880
um have the ability to

579
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,039
understand what's happening if they have

580
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
web sockets will be watching every

581
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,919
interaction

582
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,360
it's um

583
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,080
well it's really important to understand

584
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
this um

585
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,799
understand this or understand the asset

586
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,600
um at first if you're just getting

587
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,320
started so if you don't have a license

588
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,679
from for from work or anything else

589
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,360
uh if you're just getting started i

590
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,120
think burke community will suffice um

591
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,679
and uh after getting your first bounty i

592
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,679
suggest using that money to buy bar prom

593
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,400
after get roughly 500

594
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,679
um

595
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,559
and

596
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,200
i i think this this will

597
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,480
be enough to get started

598
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,080
the community um

599
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
what really helped me and um right now

600
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,360
i'm reading uh

601
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,120
well i'm really on book it's called the

602
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
atomic habits and

603
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,240
the thing that say he the the author

604
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,120
says in this book is that um

605
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,400
a lot of our habits are

606
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
are pushed around

607
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,520
how to say this

608
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,159
to get a good habit and to be to have a

609
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,080
good habit um

610
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,400
a productive habit

611
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,559
your environment is really important so

612
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,799
your family and your friends are

613
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,200
extremely important for you to get that

614
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,480
good habit and there are kids that get

615
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,280
the

616
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,840
that get and will have the habits that

617
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,240
they develop during their childhood with

618
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,200
their parents so

619
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,440
on this theory and uh realizing this now

620
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
you being part of a hacking community

621
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,960
and you won't be able to get that in any

622
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,520
country i mean physically i don't think

623
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,679
you will be able to get this opportunity

624
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,480
to

625
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,240
be part of the community of life

626
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,279
community

627
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,480
um

628
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,400
or at least still be a small community

629
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,360
but my suggestion is to get on twitter

630
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,760
follow everybody follow everybody that

631
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,320
i'm following or start following by

632
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,159
start following me and start following

633
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,159
everyone that's related to security you

634
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,679
learn a lot of from these hackers many i

635
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,480
think or every bug hunter is on twitter

636
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,360
and

637
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,679
funny thing about people that are bug

638
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,600
hunting they're really eager to flex

639
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,240
about the bounties they about

640
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,000
or the vulnerabilities that they found

641
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,200
or the amount of money they made from

642
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
this vulnerabilities so there will be a

643
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,679
lot of useful information on twitter um

644
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,240
you will you should join the hacker on

645
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,039
discord and you'll learn a lot from that

646
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,720
and uh there's um we have this uh

647
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,760
local

648
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,679
cyber edu discord well it's kind of

649
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,240
international but it's filled with

650
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
romanians and

651
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,919
you will learn a lot therefore about

652
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,840
security

653
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,360
um

654
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,320
about collaboration

655
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,720
i guess if you have if you find a friend

656
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,760
that

657
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
has this passion and will

658
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
be able to

659
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,080
hack at the same time as you or you'll

660
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,640
be able to collaborate on targets it

661
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,520
will be a lot more fun so for example a

662
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,919
few days ago i found a vulnerability

663
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,880
that

664
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,720
well i found availability somewhere

665
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,919
around a month ago and i wasn't able to

666
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,559
break it i i was half vulnerability and

667
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,400
i wasn't able to get something from that

668
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,200
vulnerability so i um

669
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,120
sent the message to a few of my friends

670
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,240
well

671
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,159
can you look at this can you can you

672
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
find something and no no one was able to

673
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,960
find anything in that part but it felt

674
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,520
like it was really really vulnerable and

675
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,200
um

676
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,600
i remember remember that i had this

677
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,679
vulnerability and it was still on my

678
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,440
mind after a month

679
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,480
and

680
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,360
i sent that message to one close friend

681
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,559
i sent i said i said to him well if you

682
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,120
look at look at this we'll get a lot of

683
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,679
money if you if you're able to hack this

684
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,120
and um

685
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,679
well he looked at it in five minutes i

686
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,159
spent the following two or three hours

687
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,440
talking with him about that and he was

688
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,279
able to

689
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,039
i was looking for a small vulnerability

690
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,799
i was looking for a cross-site scripted

691
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,559
vulnerability he was able to get a

692
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,480
remote code execution in that i don't

693
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,080
know how but

694
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,159
hiking with friends is extremely

695
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,320
extremely important you

696
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,919
i i couldn't even think about

697
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,159
getting that much impact just from a

698
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,919
thing that was i thought it was cross

699
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,400
cross side scripting or everything

700
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,679
um

701
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,640
so

702
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,960
everything related to bug bounty

703
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
training is

704
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,440
free on the internet you will

705
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,960
you can hack you can learn to hack

706
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,159
without paying for it for any courses i

707
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,760
recommend uh

708
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,159
well i recommend the web section

709
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,240
on cyber red do i recommend hacker one

710
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,679
on ctf which have a lot of real world

711
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,120
vulnerabilities

712
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,919
if you're kind of getting started but

713
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,919
even if you're really good at it web

714
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,480
security academy by porsche figure

715
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,720
have a lot of laboratories for each kind

716
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,679
of vulnerability and they get

717
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,279
deeper and deeper they're really really

718
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,840
good

719
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,360
um a thing that i was doing at first i

720
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,120
was doing a lot of ctfs when i started

721
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
so i read

722
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
about the

723
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,159
i read the write-ups of average ctf

724
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,279
from uh i read the web challenges over

725
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,520
every ctf once you have time in the

726
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,200
early interesting

727
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,760
read the hacker one activity because

728
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,679
basically that

729
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,840
here there you will see the people

730
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,919
flexing with a lot with a lot of

731
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,600
interesting vulnerabilities that they

732
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
found

733
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,919
and um

734
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,960
you'll you'll learn about the

735
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,600
so for example looking up to the right

736
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,840
you'll see that yourself vulnerability

737
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,080
on gitlab and you'll see that your lab

738
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,840
paid for critical for that type of

739
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,000
vulnerability you'll start learning

740
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,520
which companies value what

741
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,000
vulnerabilities and which which

742
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,760
vulnerabilities are more common in

743
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,960
commons over in some companies

744
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,559
and if you want to get better at bash

745
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,039
though overall challenges were

746
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,120
really really really good when i did

747
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,080
i did them over six years ago but

748
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,799
really interesting stuff to get started

749
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,159
um yeah

750
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,200
final remarks don't quit your job there

751
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,320
are

752
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,520
financial aspects to this part

753
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,559
to this uh bug bounty hunting

754
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,080
um

755
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,080
the way that i did it i

756
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,120
i

757
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,679
had a job and i was

758
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,840
doing bug bounty hunting for

759
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,559
i think one and a half year or something

760
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,640
and at some point there's some point

761
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,159
that where

762
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,480
bug bounty hunting begins to be

763
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
more and more interesting and you can

764
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,159
see that you will have more and more

765
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,000
opportunities to hack really interesting

766
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,799
companies and to get more and

767
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,520
more bounties that will surpass

768
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,240
everything that you have at your job but

769
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,559
that's not that first that's not in your

770
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,520
first month that's not in the first six

771
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,760
or ten months you might not even even

772
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,080
get a bug in the six months because even

773
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,000
for me i i

774
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,399
forgot to put the graphic here but my

775
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,320
graphics that i have

776
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,000
this year i have two or three months

777
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,159
that i only got five hundred dollars per

778
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,080
month and

779
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,279
um

780
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,000
it can be depressing it can feel like

781
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,080
well i can't find anything or i need to

782
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,760
get a job

783
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,440
but um

784
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,240
[Music]

785
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,039
i

786
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,360
the thing is this will really be

787
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,000
really hard at first

788
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,880
when you're not that skilled yet or when

789
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,159
you don't have yet that confidence that

790
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,960
you will always find something

791
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,440
so my recommendation is to

792
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,399
wait

793
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,120
for the moment that feels right in terms

794
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,000
of financial in terms of the bounty

795
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,919
amounts that you make and

796
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,640
in terms of how stable you feel with

797
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,840
everything that

798
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,360
with the bug hunting versus your job or

799
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,200
just don't quit your job ever if you

800
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,720
find this really

801
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
this is really fun for me but you can do

802
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,279
this on your off time

803
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,279
um yeah that's about it

804
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,799
you can go to q and a if anyone has

805
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,200
anything to ask me

806
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,399
thank you very much for your

807
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,640
presentation robert and i think it's

808
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
awesome how you mentioned time and time

809
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,640
again how much the community helped you

810
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
and you mentioned this at the hacking

811
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
conference that gathers together one of

812
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,120
the largest hacking communities

813
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,919
in eastern europe at least

814
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,240
so i really liked uh hearing this over

815
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,840
and over again i think so did our

816
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,200
participants i'm a bit curious um

817
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,640
how how would you describe your ways of

818
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,559
dealing with adversity like you

819
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,880
mentioned during the months when you

820
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,559
barely managed to get any

821
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,559
vulnerabilities during the months when

822
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,519
you maybe feel sluggish or tired how do

823
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,240
you stay motivated

824
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,679
um

825
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,840
well

826
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,240
um my experience i have a spreadsheet

827
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,799
that works in a certain way especially

828
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,440
especially made for this so right now

829
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,039
right now my income spreadsheet my

830
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,880
revenue spreadsheet is for one year but

831
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,240
i have an average per month month amount

832
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,640
so i never never focus on the amount of

833
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
money that i made this month or last

834
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,600
month i usually focus only on the amount

835
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,519
of the average on the average amount of

836
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,720
money that i'm making per that uh

837
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,440
per that year it can be depressing in if

838
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,120
i don't get anything in january and

839
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,760
february but this and this didn't happen

840
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,440
yet so

841
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,240
i'm only focusing on that so and the

842
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,279
other part is that

843
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,840
my only goal is to be extremely

844
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,760
proactive while

845
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,600
um and to be extremely productive

846
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,240
the productive is not a right or to be

847
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,799
extremely creative i found out that um i

848
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,519
can't be creative if i can't cover the

849
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,399
base needs so if i can hover the minimum

850
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,880
amount that i need to pay my rent play

851
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,960
uh get get the

852
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,760
money for food and everything so if a

853
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,399
month is below that it was really

854
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,480
depressing at first so when i first

855
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,720
started but after getting more and more

856
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,159
bounties and after

857
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,080
getting uh

858
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,919
it's kind of a snowball effect you get

859
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,880
more and more opportunities um

860
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,919
you

861
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,720
stop feeling that you just get used to

862
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,919
finding so even if there's a bad month

863
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,519
you will find another

864
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,880
you will find another way to find a bug

865
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,000
and it makes you creative these months

866
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,880
because

867
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,679
forces you to find new stuff

868
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,760
that's great advice um and i was

869
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,399
wondering about one more thing which is

870
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,080
sort of the flip side of what i asked

871
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,720
you about so i'm absolutely sure that at

872
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,039
times the adrenaline can be so much that

873
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,640
you want to keep doing it and keep

874
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,120
digging and keep trying things

875
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,279
and i'm gonna guess that there have been

876
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,159
times when you felt exhausted or maybe

877
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,240
burned out from

878
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,559
[Music]

879
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,720
spending so much time on maybe one

880
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,760
company or one challenge i was wondering

881
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,399
whether you draw boundaries around how

882
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,799
much time you can spend doing this and

883
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,039
how those work for you

884
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,120
um well i

885
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,600
have a bit of a tighter of a time

886
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,240
schedule so i'm right now i'm only

887
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,480
hacking on for

888
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,480
two or three days at the time on a

889
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,519
program

890
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,119
and uh

891
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,599
because that's how much i can stand

892
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,679
hacking for a program i'll get back to

893
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,480
the program only or a week later but

894
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
i'll just need those pauses and it in

895
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,119
that puzzle hack another program on what

896
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,119
i'm doing anything else but

897
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:23,918
i

898
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,159
kind of need those poses for me and i

899
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,679
can't hack for one week on one week long

900
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,679
on a program but on the other side i

901
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,599
can't hack two programs a day for

902
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,679
example because i need to really really

903
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,199
focus on a program to get deeper and

904
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,760
deeper on their surface so i need to be

905
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,639
hacking just that program for two or

906
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,079
three days straight to understand

907
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,800
everything about it

908
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
yeah makes sense and it's great that you

909
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
found something that really works for

910
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
you and that you're sticking to it

911
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,639
because as as we've heard today burnout

912
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,680
can be a real nuisance and especially

913
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,839
during this time when it's hard or

914
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,560
illegal to get out of the house yeah

915
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,000
yeah um

916
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,079
yeah it can really bring us down thank

917
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,920
you so much for your presentation i'm

918
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,839
sure it inspired a lot of people to at

919
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,040
least go into training for finding bugs

920
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,760
uh you on bug bounty programs if not

921
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,839
maybe it even inspired people to go back

922
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,040
to it if they took a break

923
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,880
and i hope you can sleep with yourself

924
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,079
at night that you're personally

925
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,040
responsible for that

926
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,119
i'm really hoping i'm really hoping that

927
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,760
one one year or two years after uh this

928
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
presentation someone will come up to me

929
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,160
and say well i saw a presentation i was

930
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,320
really motivated by because i did that

931
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,240
to a lot of people that motivated me at

932
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,800
first so at first i was like watching a

933
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,240
lot of slides and presentations and

934
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,000
from people that did

935
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,920
similar presentations to mine on bug

936
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
hunting and

937
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,839
one or three years two years later when

938
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,839
i kind of met them through the community

939
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,160
i told them well i really enjoyed the

940
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,079
stuff that you put out there

941
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,640
it was really important for me on my

942
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,320
journey
