takes for not so hot takes

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640
on threats and lessons learned during a

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,279
pandemic but this panel is special not

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,599
just because it involves a range of

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,240
specialists that i respect and look up

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,599

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,200
uh lukas i i hope i said your name right

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,440
yes my hello and you said my name

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,840
correctly

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,239
um

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
so the topic is threats and lessons

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,120
learned during the pandemic um

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,360
i wouldn't say uh

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,120
many of the threats are new as much as

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
the old threats are acting in a

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,720
significantly different context

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,959
and landscape and that is obviously

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,360
driven by the widespread and

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
forced adoption of remote work

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,160
that companies have had to face and deal

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,800
with uh which has led to accelerated

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
digital transformations

72
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,280
uh and has changed the way

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
the local network perimeter is perceived

74
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
or rather it's hard to have a local

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,920
network perimeter when all of all or

76
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,519
most of your employees are no longer

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,519
working from inside the local network or

78
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,680
office branches

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
only it's safe to say that early in the

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
pandemic many companies scrambled to

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,920
implement work from home with a focus on

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
business continuity and not necessarily

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
on security

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,319
uh this meant uh opening uh remote

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,360
access ports uh it meant allowing

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,959
employees to work from their personal

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,879
non-company-managed computers because

88
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
maybe they didn't have enough machines

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,799
to give to all of their employees

90
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,599
uh they tried to scale scale their vpns

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,519
only to find that the

92
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,159
hardware vpn gateways or concentrators

93
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,640
were unable to cope with the

94
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
much larger traffic and number of

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,319
concurrent users

96
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,760
uh and various others issues

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
so

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,720
damian

99
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,879
you're an i.t consultant and i i i

100
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,799
assume you've advised many companies

101
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,959
that have had to deal with this

102
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,200
uh what are what is your take on this

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,840
how have they progressed how how have

104
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,680
things progressed since then since the

105
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
the early stages when everyone kind of

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,959
rushed to

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,320
put something together that just works

108
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,400
first off hello everyone and uh nice to

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,040
see you and hear you again lucian

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,800
um

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,919
yes we've we've dealt with um

112
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,639
the the main impact of this very early

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,440
on

114
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,680
we've seen a lot of companies struggle

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,479
to

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,360
um

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,680
i know rush as you said rush the whole

118
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,639
digital transformation initiative

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,199
they all had something going on they all

120
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,080
had

121
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,720
something in mind they were all

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,680
kind of prepared like they were using

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
vpns before and they had some work from

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,320
home policy

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,720
where a few people

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,280
a day a week a month would work from

127
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,160
home they were not prepared for everyone

128
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,199
working from home that's for sure so the

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,520
the initial impact was

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,600
a strain mostly on their resources their

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
available bandwidth their available

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,800
staff to address all the potential

133
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,919
problems

134
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,800
um we've seen uh we've seen companies

135
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
struggle with their ip staff not being

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,280
able to keep up in helping everyone set

137
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,120
up their home vpn connections for

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,199
instance and things like that uh not

139
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,840
having say enough licenses or on their

140
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,280
devices to allow that many simultaneous

141
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,120
remote connections and things like that

142
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,919
so

143
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,800
it was a hard lesson for a lot of them

144
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
because they simply couldn't do their

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,880
job anymore even though technically they

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
would have had the the setup in place

147
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
they they didn't plan and nobody really

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,919
planned for

149
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,039
for that so the the first impact was was

150
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,400
a major

151
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,520
uh shift and rush to make everything

152
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
work in a way that maybe they've tried

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,720
before but on a smaller scale

154
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
um then the the next wave of challenges

155
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,560
i think was around how to better protect

156
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,319
all those devices that are now

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,880
connecting to your

158
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,600
wi-fi at home which is

159
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
probably not the most secure network out

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,120
there

161
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,400
for most people and that suddenly became

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
their work network

163
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
and a lot of companies didn't have the

164
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,759
the tools and and methods to properly

165
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,039
check for

166
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,319
um those devices being safe those device

167
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
devices being up to date before they

168
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,720
connect to the to the company network at

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,280
the same time people were

170
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,360
browsing on the internet doing their

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
personal stuff on their home

172
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,560
wi-fi and then

173
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,960
using the same device to connect to the

174
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,400
corporate or

175
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,919
company network

176
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,120
while having maybe an infected computer

177
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,919
and that launched a lot of um

178
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,759
a lot of attacks that

179
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,319
appear to have originated from from the

180
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,400
inside and there was a growth i think it

181
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,599
was about

182
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,800
25

183
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,440
of reported attacks last year originated

184
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,280
from inside the company from inside the

185
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,599
network it doesn't mean that that the

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,720
company

187
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,319
had people that

188
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,639
had bad intentions and they were trying

189
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,960
to hack their own

190
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,840
their own organization it's that their

191
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,000
accounts and their devices got

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,639
compromised and that led to these

193
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,560
attacks happening from

194
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,720
if you want the inside

195
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
because those people those accounts had

196
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
access to company data and company

197
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
information so i think that was um

198
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,199
another another major shift and i've

199
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,199
i've covered this in uh in a bunch of

200
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,080
other talks uh at some other conferences

201
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,840
looking at the the the trends um the

202
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,080
inability for companies to consistently

203
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,240
detect those insider attacks was another

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
issue um

205
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,720
usually having that traditional approach

206
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
where

207
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,199
everything is like a castle and moat uh

208
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,039
security where

209
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
we're here on the inside the company

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
network the company data center and

211
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
everything here all the devices we own

212
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,960
and we control so everything is safe and

213
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,039
everything on the outside is not

214
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,840
uh when that changed and suddenly all

215
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,680
those devices were on the outside of the

216
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,880
castle uh like beyond the moat beyond

217
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,559
the the walls of the castle and suddenly

218
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
all those devices had to connect and had

219
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,880
to access the data so

220
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,839
uh being able to detect whether uh

221
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,040
that's a malicious user

222
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,360
posing as a legitimate user or it's

223
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
actually a legitimate user doing

224
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,240
something on a saturday at a.m that was

225
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,760
very hard for for a lot of companies

226
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
accelerating that bring your own device

227
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,240
approach also caused issues and it's

228
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
it's a challenge that i don't think many

229
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
companies have have solved completely

230
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
even right now i want to get back to

231
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,399
the actual uh issue of

232
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,440
detecting some of these attacks

233
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,839
especially for small and medium-sized

234
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,120
businesses

235
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,560
uh i i know uh

236
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,640
christian uh you work with mssps right

237
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
and i know that uh small and

238
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,120
medium-sized businesses in particular

239
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
uh have a hard very hard time with

240
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,600
exactly what tudor was saying

241
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,640
um

242
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,560
which is they lacked their resources

243
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,880
obviously working from remotely has made

244
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,800
it hard for security teams in general to

245
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
respond to attacks but also small small

246
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,800
and medium-sized companies didn't

247
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,519
necessarily have the budget or the the

248
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,880
talent uh

249
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,519
the the number of uh security team

250
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,200
members to deal

251
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
with some of the sophisticated attacks

252
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
we've seen like ransomware

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,800
uh

254
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,560
so many of them

255
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
have kind of

256
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,760
uh

257
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,600
oriented themselves

258
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,560
into

259
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,399
uh offloading that work to mssps instead

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,279
right

261
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,160
uh

262
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
is that something you've seen how how

263
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,320
have you seen the market

264
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
develop have you seen growth and

265
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
yes

266
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,839
so that's uh you know that's

267
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,000
several facets to the question that that

268
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,279
you ask so

269
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,560
um

270
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,920
back to what uh tudy was saying a couple

271
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,320
of minutes ago i think you know what he

272
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,399
explained is that it was hard for the

273
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,760
enterprises right uh and it still is it

274
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
still is a challenge

275
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,640
if we're now

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,440
looking lower into the into the smbs

277
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,120
i think for them

278
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,640
um it was probably even harder because

279
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,000
they don't they didn't have all the

280
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,160
processes in place before before the

281
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,640
pandemic they still don't most of them

282
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,959
that's why we see so many successful

283
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,839
attacks recently

284
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,680
they don't have the budgets for sure as

285
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
you as you very well said

286
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
they are relying mostly on msps

287
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,680
uh to do the work and those msps aren't

288
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,279
all the time

289
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,800
they don't all the time have the

290
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
security in mind so that's you know the

291
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
difference between msps and mssps

292
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
is that um

293
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,079
it's it's a fine fine line i

294
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,440
i've seen msps being really interested

295
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,399
in progressing towards mssps

296
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,720
recently that's an important trend but

297
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
they don't have the resources to to do

298
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,160
that by themselves

299
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,360
having i mean

300
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,079
most of the msps in in the world are are

301
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,360
small medium sized businesses themselves

302
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,760
they don't always have their security

303
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,320
teams in place they have mixed roles

304
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,600
where

305
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
i.t people get some security

306
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
responsibilities but they're not

307
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,079
particularly trained for that and they

308
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,360
have

309
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,880
you know they have their their own

310
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,160
challenges

311
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
in

312
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
acquiring and um

313
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,000
you know

314
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
making sure they have the right

315
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,440
resources in place to to tackle with

316
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,279
those without with those challenges on

317
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,560
the other hand

318
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,040
we've got the attackers um which brought

319
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,320
apt down markets so we've got now apt as

320
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
a service it's a pretty

321
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,320
common thing to happen

322
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,959
um and uh and therefore

323
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,760
we haven't seen though that many apts um

324
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,240
very targeted like they used to be in

325
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,440
the past years

326
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,399
we've seen them spread a lot

327
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,200
um no matter where the target is so

328
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
they're not that

329
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
niched they are much more widespread

330
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
and they're looking for really low

331
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
hanging fruits that they can exploit and

332
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,279
you know these this is is it's extremely

333
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,200
easy to find those

334
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
um all over the place unfortunately the

335
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,399
the duration for patching is still

336
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,440
pretty high especially in in smbs

337
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
and especially with

338
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
those people working from home so not

339
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,000
all of the traditional controls

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,560
are working effectively anymore for for

341
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,839
a lot of people

342
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,160
um due to those vpn constraints and

343
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,519
stuff like that

344
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,360
but i would say um

345
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,600
you know

346
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
i'd say everything is an apt these days

347
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,800
right there's been a shift in threat

348
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,880
models uh in recent years with

349
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,440
the commoditization of apt-style attacks

350
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
and techniques whether this happened

351
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,680
because of hackers working with

352
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
government backed actors and taking some

353
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
of those techniques back into the cyber

354
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,880
crime world or just cyber criminals

355
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,040
learning from all the reports and all

356
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
the techniques because financial

357
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,199
at least financially motivated cyber

358
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,560
crime used to be focused more on

359
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,000
stealing money not necessarily on

360
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,480
stealthiness and long-term compromise

361
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,519
and data exfiltration

362
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,560
which

363
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,800
that has shifted we have most of the

364
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
ransomware groups for the past few years

365
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,680
are manually operated ransomware groups

366
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
they work with affiliates who compromise

367
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,440
the network they use manual hacking

368
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
lateral movement techniques wireless

369
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
execution

370
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,880
credential theft with the goal of

371
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
gaining domain credentials

372
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
domain admin credentials and then they

373
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,279
deploy the ransomware on the most

374
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,040
valuable systems or all the systems at

375
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,320
the same time

376
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,279
and it's usually a a very customized

377
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,360
payload for that particular organization

378
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
and this is very apt-like right if we

379
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,760
are to think in the past and whereas in

380
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,680
the past if you were like a hospital a

381
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,279
small clinic if you were a

382
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,240
maybe an attorney's office or any type

383
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
of small business you weren't

384
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,959
necessarily the target of government

385
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
sponsored the cyber espionage right but

386
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,959
you now have to face

387
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,800
and your your defenses

388
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
were adapted to what you were facing

389
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
which was general malware and that sort

390
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,880
of thing but now you kind of have to

391
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,600
deal with this much more sophisticated

392
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,839
attacks that require

393
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,360
additional products visibility logs uh

394
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,399
uh what what tudor was saying basically

395
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,760
you need a lot of visibility to deal

396
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,839
with this threat right

397
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,600
and going back to something that he was

398
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
saying

399
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,560
is uh

400
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,639
the insider threats and the insider

401
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,759
threats can

402
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,920
are not only your employees being

403
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
compromised and then lateral movement

404
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
being performed from their devices or

405
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,160
their accounts but we've seen recently

406
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,399
and in the past few years msps being

407
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,959
targeting themselves so the supply in

408
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,800
the supply chain or the services digital

409
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
supply digital services supply chain

410
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,959
where the msps have been targeted in

411
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
order to reach their customers right

412
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
because it's an easy easier way than to

413
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,880
compromise individual companies you

414
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,120
target an msps and then infect all of

415
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,199
their customers right

416
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,839
and that seems to be a trend uh and

417
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,720
there's

418
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,040
it kind of seems that companies are have

419
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,959
a very hard time winning right on one

420
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,480
hand in order to deal with the

421
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,199
sophisticated attacks they went and and

422
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,880
contracted out

423
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,839
mssps or msps to handle their cloud

424
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,440
infrastructure because they've switched

425
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,759
to cloud services and that sort of thing

426
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,639
and now those mssps and msps have become

427
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,560
an insider threats to them inside their

428
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
trust to them

429
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
how

430
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,639
what do you think the solution is there

431
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,440
is there is there no way for them to win

432
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,320
there is for sure a way to win um

433
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
they're always there they're it's been

434
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,279
here for for a long time it's just that

435
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,320
it's it's hard to to do it so people

436
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
kind of avoid doing the hard things that

437
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,240
need to be done in my opinion that's

438
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
cyber hygiene

439
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,160
those you know mfas stuff like that a

440
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,120
lot of the msps that were compromised

441
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,199
uh you know they they were doing poor

442
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,120
hygiene on their own

443
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,959
on their own networks and their own

444
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,319
infrastructure actually in terms of

445
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,000
the the msp

446
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,319
kill chain i would say this is actually

447
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,000
started before the pandemic we've had

448
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,439
the first

449
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,319
major breach in 2019 september so that

450
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,520
was actually before um before we went

451
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,160
into the pandemic so hackers

452
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,720
found that these are you know

453
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,799
uh heck the keeper of the keys and you

454
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,799
have the keys to the kingdom right so

455
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,480
that that was you

456
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,280
then what i'm saying is it's not

457
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
obviously most of these threats are not

458
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,799
new and they you know supply chain

459
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,160
attacks have been going on for a number

460
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,799
of years it's nothing new uh the issue

461
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,520
is now the pandemic kind of uh

462
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
accelerated companies

463
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,320
adopting or contracting msps and now the

464
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
you could say the threat is higher

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,360
because there's a larger number of

466
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
potential victims out there or the risk

467
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,799
is higher right

468
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,480
that is a hundred percent 100 correct

469
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,200
however i think that the migration to to

470
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
the cloud and the migration to msps

471
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
although it may be a little risky on the

472
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,679
short term as as you put it right

473
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,240
it's probably the the you know

474
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
the way the market is consolidating

475
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,360
right now so i don't think smbs have

476
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,240
have had or would have had chances by

477
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,760
themselves to deal with this

478
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
and i think there is a higher chance of

479
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
them being properly protected

480
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
if they work with the right msp and if

481
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,280
they um if they understand that they're

482
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,039
they need to increase the budget that

483
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,200
they're allocating i mean just paying

484
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,600
for the basic

485
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,840
m365 or g suite or whatever that is is

486
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,240
it's not it's not enough so they they

487
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
need to adapt that moving from the

488
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
office to the to the home to the new

489
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,919
model

490
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,160
actually requires them to to make some

491
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,760
significant changes to the way they they

492
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,640
treat id and in general and of course

493
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,880
making sure that cyber is

494
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,080
dealt with in in depth and having

495
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
not just tools because it's easy to buy

496
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
tools but having the right people

497
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,320
monitoring those tools and actually

498
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,440
taking uh taking action in case an

499
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,520
attack happens

500
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,679
there i mean the reaction time the

501
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,320
incident response is extremely critical

502
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,480
and in how you deal with that and the

503
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
length and the you know the impact of

504
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,240
that of that attack can be you know

505
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,280
higher

506
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,720
highly controlled

507
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,200
so what you're saying is careful careful

508
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,520
selection of your msp and

509
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,840
mssp basically

510
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,880
asking those questions right uh

511
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,960
how does your security program look like

512
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
perform regular penetration tests uh do

513
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,720
you use

514
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,760
multi-factor authentication how can we

515
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,919
log your access that we're giving you

516
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,400
into our network and and uh

517
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,360
do we have those those ex those logs for

518
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
traceability and forensics

519
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
investigations later on if something

520
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,640
happens

521
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,240
um

522
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
how can we limit uh

523
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,159
your your access right uh i've seen uh

524
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,159
organizations who

525
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,880
give out company managed uh

526
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
enterprise or companies manage machines

527
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
laptops to their outside contractors

528
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,280
right and you are only allowed to access

529
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,039
the network from those machines not your

530
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,360
machine not your company's machine

531
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,120
we are giving you out this laptop and

532
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
this is the laptop you have to use to

533
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,159
access our network if you need to

534
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
perform certain certain things

535
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,159
um

536
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:32,960
so

537
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
i would say uh i would like to

538
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,679
move back a little bit into into the

539
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,679
threads and and tudor was saying that

540
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,120
all of those device when we were talking

541
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,360
about devices and

542
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,720
most people

543
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,960
tend to immediately think of laptops

544
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,559
that sort of thing that companies have

545
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,559
to work from home but we also have

546
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,640
mobile devices right

547
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,440
and probably with mobile devices this is

548
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,559
uh

549
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,039
a bit more widespread because

550
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,360
many companies allowed employees to use

551
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,200
their personal mobile devices in the

552
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,440
before the pandemic as well as part of

553
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
your bring your own device uh policies

554
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,320
uh but this has also accelerated so um

555
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,400
i'm i'm

556
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,039
i want to ask lukas uh what are some of

557
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,559
the trends there that you've seen during

558
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,360
the epidemic have the attacks against

559
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,159
mobile users increased have you seen

560
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,159
anything that's

561
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,200
been

562
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,520
trying to piggyback on the pandemic have

563
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,080
you seen some

564
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,320
apt groups or other groups that have

565
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,400
adopted uh

566
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,559
android malware who maybe were not using

567
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,678
android malware in the past

568
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,280
um coit 19 threats on mobile or android

569
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,120
platform um

570
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,080
were spotted instantly when pandemic

571
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,559
started seeing that the bad guys or

572
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,400
threat actors

573
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,880
saw a huge opportunity since you could

574
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,760
be recall what happened back then

575
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,679
no one knows what is happening everyone

576
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
is looking down there was a lack of

577
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,440
information what is happening in your

578
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,799
country

579
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,120
all around the world and the bad guys

580
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,720
exploited that

581
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,520
we've seen a distribution of android

582
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,080
malware through fake websites text

583
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,919
messages emails

584
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,120
where for example these websites try to

585
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,559
impersonate chronovirus trackers

586
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,559
government applications that would point

587
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,960
you what you should do in case you have

588
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,799
any symptoms

589
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,039
chronovirus symptoms identifiers to the

590
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,240
application

591
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,360
afterwards

592
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,600
compensations applications were created

593
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
by your government

594
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,400
for some states register for vaccine

595
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
websites and applications that would

596
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,840
lead you to download malware and since

597
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,320
we need to stay connected

598
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
either with our colleagues or with our

599
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,960
friends family they were also identified

600
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,600
and found fake malicious zoom

601
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
applications

602
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,679
which their goal was to spy on others

603
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,400
and

604
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,640
talking about the threats

605
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,919
actually i have seen all of them in a

606
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,880
short span short span period

607
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,120
there were spywares

608
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,480
either

609
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,919
open source fires or

610
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,679
off the shell that were already on the

611
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,080
market and also new ones that were

612
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,880
developed and spread during the pandemic

613
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,120
ransomware file encrypting

614
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,640
requesting cryptocurrency sms worms

615
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,520
um ad where the most popular based on

616
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,559
our data was the spread distribution of

617
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,080
android banking trojans which call was

618
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,799
to lower to steal credentials for

619
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,039
banking cryptocurrency applications

620
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,799
credit card details etc

621
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,400
okay

622
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,760
um

623
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,480
there's

624
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
another trend that i want to uh bring up

625
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,240
and that is uh the rise of cyber

626
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
mercenary groups

627
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,320
uh and by that i mean

628
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,640
cyber criminal groups that have ventured

629
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,000
off into cyber espionage uh hacker for

630
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,480
hire pretty much if you think of the

631
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,360
affiliates uh in the case of ransomware

632
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,120
groups they work with affiliates that

633
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,200
provide or do the hacking

634
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,559
for them

635
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,480
and provide the access and that sort of

636
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,720
thing some of these groups

637
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,279
uh are also selling their services on

638
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,520
the open market and

639
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
not only to gov potential government

640
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,400
agencies but any

641
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,360
competitors anyone who wants that

642
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,679
intellectual property anyone with a

643
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,200
garage extortionist and so on and so on

644
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,600
which again

645
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
like with ransomware it expands the

646
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,320
scope of the threat or the scope of

647
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,080
companies and organizations that would

648
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,919
have to deal with it

649
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,480
this issue and individuals

650
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
and we've seen we've seen cases with

651
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,120
such groups that targeted small 3d

652
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,679
modeling companies that work with

653
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,200
international architects on projects

654
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
that targeted

655
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,960
law offices to get access to some legal

656
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,360
documents so these are not big

657
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,120
enterprises that work in the defense

658
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,679
space or the traditional targets for

659
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,919
apt-style attacks right

660
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,400
and it's some of these groups uh are

661
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,480
also known to use uh

662
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,679
mobile spyware right have you seen uh

663
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,919
an increase there and also when i'm

664
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,440
talking about individuals i'm talking

665
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
about maybe high-profile individuals

666
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
we've seen

667
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
the c-level executives of certain

668
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,720
companies being targeted but not only

669
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,440
them also their immediate families

670
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,880
as well

671
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,720
for various reasons by these groups

672
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
correct

673
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,039
since using your smartphone to spy on

674
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,360
others is in my opinion the best way

675
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,919
since we are carrying it in our pockets

676
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,080
it's connected to internet in many cases

677
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,240
for many users 24 7. it's always on

678
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,440
you have

679
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
in my opinion

680
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,760
all the personal information there

681
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,159
all stored credentials credit card

682
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,880
connection to your

683
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,159
work vpns etc so this is the best way

684
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,240
how to snoop in

685
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,559
and steal some data to start a cyber

686
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,000
espionage

687
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,360
and there are two

688
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,960
point of views i would say that i've

689
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,400
seen it during last last year or so

690
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,919
and the first one

691
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,039
are

692
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,679
trojans spires and remotely

693
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,600
administrated trojans

694
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,880
that were distributed through

695
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,279
underground forums

696
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,360
there is a lot of them

697
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,919
since they actually don't sell their

698
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,279
source code

699
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,400
but

700
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,279
provide their services or for others

701
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,640
which means

702
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,919
they are the ones that have all the

703
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,400
information to think about that

704
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,880
not the ones who rent it

705
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,120
many of them scenes also there were a

706
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,080
couple of

707
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,440
these spywares that went public with

708
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,279
their source code and based on the open

709
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,799
source code that was highly

710
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,200
sophisticated were created the new

711
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,760
branches of new subscribers that were

712
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,279
being used

713
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,760
in the in the wild as the first case the

714
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,799
second one i would say companies that

715
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,120
were

716
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,080
using exploits as you suggested to

717
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
target

718
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,200
high profile individuals c

719
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,120
managers

720
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,080
ceos journalists etc

721
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,399
we have heard a lot about that in the

722
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,120
last couple of days i don't think it's

723
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,240
connected directly to the pandemic

724
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
situation however they use fibers the

725
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
same as the ones before well not the

726
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,440
same not the same but the same

727
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,600
functionality since their goal is to spy

728
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
on the victim snoop on their

729
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,679
communication on their social media take

730
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,559
pictures recode phone calls

731
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,960
maybe even extract credentials to get

732
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,320
access to

733
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,159
um other systems

734
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,559
that they have access photos and and so

735
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,440
on the difference is that this power is

736
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,080
not using any exports to try to

737
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,720
gain access nearly by

738
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,159
um

739
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,000
being distributed

740
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
through let's say phishing to fake

741
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
websites etc

742
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,960
others that use high profile exploits

743
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,760
zero days in many cases zero click

744
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,960
exploits or chain of exploits that would

745
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,760
escalate privileges to root and

746
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,080
um stay persistent with today with their

747
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,720
model and afterwards communicate with

748
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,600
them with a server with a owner um now

749
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,840
and then

750
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
what would be your advice there both for

751
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,919
this high profile individuals

752
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,440
who might be a target for various

753
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360
reasons and i'm not only talking about

754
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,440
business executives but as you mentioned

755
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,880
journalists activists

756
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,440
human rights activists political

757
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,520
dissidents uh

758
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,080
people who are are usually the target of

759
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,039
such attacks but anyone who can you know

760
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,919
analyze what they're doing for work or

761
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,720
uh

762
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,240
in their

763
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,279
and realize that there are some groups

764
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,480
who might be

765
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,240
threatened by their actions right so

766
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,360
they might become a target themselves

767
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,279
what do you think they should do because

768
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,520
it's very hard for individuals in

769
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,480
general

770
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,679
to protect themselves from

771
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,279
well-resourced attackers with a lot of

772
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,279
time on their hands and

773
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,000
so

774
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,120
sophisticated tools and techniques right

775
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,880
yeah yes

776
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,480
it's nearly impossible to protect

777
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,960
against the attackers that have

778
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,440
infinite number of resources to to

779
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,840
target these high-profile individuals

780
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,640
and when we talk about zero click zero

781
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,880
they exploit there is no way to protect

782
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,360
against that

783
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,279
otherwise if we talk about

784
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,679
standard spyware that are sent through

785
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,279
social media

786
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,679
to phishing through emails i would say

787
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,120
stay up to date

788
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,360
and also in case there are new um

789
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
systems new updates in your system

790
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,399
either using either you are using ios or

791
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,000
android

792
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,760
always stay up to date with your apps as

793
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,640
well since we've seen this is zero

794
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,760
click exploits in a popular social media

795
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,080
and instant messaging applications in

796
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,679
the in the past

797
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,200
stay up to date

798
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,080
um

799
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,200
don't

800
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,279
click on every link you receive make

801
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,960
sure to verify who sent that to you

802
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
that's not super simple

803
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,200
uh download apps only from verified

804
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,480
sources which means official app stores

805
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,919
and in case

806
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,320
to to be extra safe if you believe you

807
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,960
might be target or targeted in the

808
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,240
future i would suggest to use um

809
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,640
security solution trustworthy security

810
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,279
software that is up to date to protect

811
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,679
you against the phishing links links and

812
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,880
the malicious binaries

813
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,600
okay i would say overall

814
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,159
based on my coverage uh over the years

815
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,559
i've seen the android ecosystem is still

816
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,720
very fragmented but

817
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,080
things have improved in quite a bit from

818
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,760
from back in the day

819
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,320
uh would you say it's still important to

820
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,679
choose a phone manufacturer that has

821
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,200
uh commits to regular security updates

822
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,480
uh either monthly updates or quarterly

823
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,200
updates or uh something like that so at

824
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,480
least you know

825
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,039
uh and to certain support periods for

826
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,200
for for devices for certain uh

827
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,720
because sometimes with this these phones

828
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,600
uh you are unsure as a user when your

829
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
phone will go out of support whether

830
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,200
you'll get the updates immediately

831
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,880
google is very good at issuing monthly

832
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,279
security updates but until they trickle

833
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,799
down through all the vendors and all the

834
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,880
former updates and and all that and then

835
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
the high-end models seems to be seem to

836
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,240
be more

837
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,159
prioritized by the vendors than their

838
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,640
mid-range and low-end uh

839
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,679
models

840
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,200
so

841
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,080
would you advise users investigating a

842
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,760
little bit uh

843
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,720
what their

844
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,279
what different phone manufacturers

845
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,200
offer in terms of security updates and

846
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,399
the commitments they've made

847
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,880
this is also important

848
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,080
for for end users for employees and also

849
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,320
for the high profile people

850
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,200
that

851
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,679
even the different oems there's a lot of

852
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,120
them these days

853
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,840
many of them provide super cheap

854
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,600
smartphones and their layer it's the

855
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
bulk the android that we call it like

856
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,320
that

857
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,120
creates another opportunity for the bad

858
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,080
guys for the this is every exploit being

859
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,720
delivered in a place so i would suggest

860
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
to stay with updated smartphone as you

861
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,799
guys just said

862
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,480
that have

863
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,640
um

864
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,399
as

865
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,039
least as possible additional binaries

866
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,240
from oems from uh from vendors to

867
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,360
have

868
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,480
stock

869
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,679
android

870
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,760
which is fully supported with updates

871
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,919
with monthly security bulletins

872
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,840
and the system updates as well not to

873
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,000
actually give your

874
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,120
employees

875
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,840
the cheapest smartphones and think that

876
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,080
they will use it for 10 years and not

877
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,000
expect that something might happen in

878
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,559
the future so some breaches for example

879
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,080
okay thank you

880
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,600
uh i'd like to

881
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,120
shift back to

882
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,760
remote access uh because i think that's

883
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,279
the

884
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,399
the primary generator generator of this

885
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,399
uh increased threats that we've seen

886
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,600
during the department of increased

887
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,880
problems right

888
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,399
and it's very many companies have

889
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,480
shifted towards

890
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,480
the zero trust network access

891
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,480
concepts where

892
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,320
since we no longer seem to have a

893
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,239
network perimeter or no one's inside the

894
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,079
network perimeter anymore since vpns

895
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,159
don't seem to scale very well

896
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,199
uh then it's important that we treat

897
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,800
everyone whether they're outside the

898
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,560
network or inside the network the same

899
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,480
and the focus is not put on the location

900
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,520
of the

901
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,320
device or the employee but rather on the

902
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,599
user identity the device identity base

903
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,918
the device security posture

904
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,239
and we have all of these vendors that

905
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,639
have come out with zero trust network

906
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,960
network access solutions now

907
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
uh where

908
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,199
the majority of them i would say are for

909
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,760
web-based applications uh like basically

910
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
linking your internal web-based

911
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,918
application to the outside world in a

912
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,320
secure manner where you have this access

913
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,280
portal

914
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,159
uh that users have to go through uh but

915
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,800
also there's uh zero traffic network

916
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
access that supports other protocols and

917
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,079
other

918
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,599
different type of applications and not

919
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,720
just web-based right

920
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,040
tudor what have you seen in this uh in

921
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,599
this space have you seen more companies

922
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,079
adopting those i know cloudflare has a

923
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,480
solution google came out with a solution

924
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,560
after being one of the early adopters of

925
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,079
uh zero trust

926
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,240
uh they've they've finally launched the

927
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,640
products there's others akamai has one

928
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,800
generally i think like all the content

929
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
network delivery

930
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,280
companies that have you know a lot of

931
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
servers around the world and can support

932
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,560
this type of activity have provided uh i

933
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
know there's dual security they got

934
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,880
acquired by cisco and so on and so on so

935
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
there's many options out there for for

936
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,640
this sort of thing uh

937
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,960
now for companies uh

938
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,359
are you have you seen companies shifting

939
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,000
towards that instead of trying to scale

940
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,320
their vpns for example

941
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,440
oh yeah definitely and i think um i

942
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,560
think it's

943
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,079
the the only real solution to

944
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,320
to the problem just scaling your

945
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,720
existing solutions which don't cover the

946
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,119
the exact problems that you mentioned

947
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,839
um will not be enough to to protect

948
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,280
users to protect companies from that and

949
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,800
actually in my session later today i go

950
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,760
into a bit more detail on how the whole

951
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,000
xero trust approaches is handled so um

952
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,280
i do believe that it is the

953
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,160
the only um

954
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,079
efficient solution right now that we're

955
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,400
seeing out there the the shift towards

956
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,160
zero trust and the zero trust

957
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,920
methodologies and philosophies and

958
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,000
solutions and there's indeed a lot of

959
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,200
them out there

960
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,000
and it is also a matter of finding the

961
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,359
right one for you and figuring what's

962
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,320
enough and what you actually need to

963
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,960
implement it's not just hey you use this

964
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,880
technology and this will fix all your

965
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,599
problems that's never been the case

966
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,560
um but it is all about verifying

967
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,240
everything explicitly

968
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,880
not just making sure that a specific

969
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,359
user has access to your network

970
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,320
it's about making sure that that user

971
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,760
has access to a particular application

972
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,160
on a particular server at a particular

973
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,800
time of day from a particular device and

974
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,200
checking for all those things making

975
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
sure that those things are something

976
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,240
that you validate constantly and that

977
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,680
any any sort of

978
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,560
behavior that doesn't match the regular

979
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,680
patterns

980
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,400
is flagged and you get

981
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,960
some form of alert or response automated

982
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,640
response to it

983
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,040
looking at implementing a full-scale

984
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,359
least privileged access

985
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,000
as well don't give everyone access to

986
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
everything if you're connected to the

987
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
vpn you basically have access to

988
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,640
everything if nobody checks whether you

989
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,119
actually need access to that particular

990
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,800
server or that particular application

991
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
once you're on the vpn

992
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,000
that's where the problems start

993
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,119
appearing

994
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,720
um i've i've not seen a lot of companies

995
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
implementing for instance the assume

996
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,440
breach approach

997
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,560
thinking

998
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,640
in the in the lines of

999
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,079
um not how how you can prevent from

1000
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,400
getting hacked but what if you've

1001
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,960
already got hacked and

1002
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,680
uh now you've been hacked for two months

1003
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,839
how how would you be able to detect

1004
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,800
today that you've been hacked last week

1005
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,160
what is it that you need to do

1006
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,280
differently

1007
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,240
to to find that hey there's something

1008
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,880
weird going on on a server or in my

1009
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,480
network

1010
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,520
and that's something that as an approach

1011
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,599
uh we've seen it's harder to to

1012
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,560
implement

1013
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,240
and another

1014
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,640
huge thing basically basically internal

1015
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,880
threat hunting is what yes some some

1016
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,119
form of internal threat hunting looking

1017
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,160
for uh indicators of attack indicators

1018
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,880
of compromise looking at those things

1019
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
that would show you that there's

1020
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,480
something going on that shouldn't be

1021
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,520
going on

1022
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,680
uh in your network so there's there's a

1023
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,480
lot of solutions there as well just look

1024
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
at things like i know dark trace and

1025
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,920
similar stuff the the

1026
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,640
other point that i think a lot of people

1027
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,760
and companies big and small are missing

1028
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,720
is the human component no matter how

1029
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,760
much technology you throw at the problem

1030
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
um there's always going to be that part

1031
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,040
where you need to educate your users

1032
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,720
and i think that's also where a lot of

1033
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,000
companies are are still failing and

1034
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,320
having that insight giving people that

1035
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,280
sort of

1036
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,560
basic knowledge about how their home

1037
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,800
wi-fi works and why

1038
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,079
this solution this vpn is different from

1039
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,000
the other solution we've been using last

1040
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,640
week and how that impacts you maybe

1041
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,079
personally

1042
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,079
giving them just the basics of how your

1043
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,880
phone should be secured and why those

1044
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,240
monthly patches from your vendor matter

1045
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,640
uh giving people the info about that i

1046
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,160
think that's also

1047
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,240
or should also be part of the discussion

1048
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,920
and it's it's kind of missed um where

1049
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
everyone just focuses on what sort of

1050
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
technology and what sort of

1051
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,400
uh i don't know best practice should we

1052
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,240
should we implement now

1053
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,480
right but do you think that companies

1054
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,280
have actually

1055
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,599
chosen zero trust network taxes but are

1056
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,599
still kind of treating it

1057
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,280
as external versus internal in that uh

1058
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,520
they they needed the solution and vpns

1059
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,599
didn't scale so let's do this let's

1060
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,160
allow let's use these solutions

1061
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,079
dissolution for remote employees to now

1062
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,000
access the internal network but they

1063
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,839
haven't really applied the same concept

1064
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,800
of zero trust on their internal networks

1065
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,560
uh and there should be no drift

1066
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,880
difference there right uh the same

1067
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,640
principles you apply for the external

1068
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,920
connection should be applied for the

1069
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,200
internal connection something on the

1070
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,800
network should not be able to just

1071
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,079
access anything or connect to

1072
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,359
access everything or connect to

1073
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,440
everything on the network and it goes

1074
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,119
beyond just traditional network

1075
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,960
segmentation where you put certain

1076
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,800
number of servers in a more critical

1077
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,319
segment than others in other

1078
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,480
workstations in another segment right

1079
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,119
it's about access to applications it's

1080
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,040
machine to machine communication it's

1081
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,760
everything that you just mentioned those

1082
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,920
granular policies of

1083
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,319
who access what from what device at what

1084
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,319
time and for what purpose and that sort

1085
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,720
of thing right so

1086
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,640
uh

1087
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,280
would you say that that's a component

1088
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,680
that's and that also basically helps

1089
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,560
with the mentality shift that you

1090
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,960
mentioned in that

1091
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,720
okay i'm trying to defend against the

1092
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,640
text but let's assume i've been

1093
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,400
compromised so what am i doing

1094
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
internally on the network so that if i

1095
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,079
am compromised

1096
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,400
the impact is kept

1097
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,960
as low as possible they don't manage to

1098
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,359
access everything just because they

1099
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,880
they manage to

1100
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,440
to hack into george george's computer or

1101
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,520
they managed to

1102
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,000
access the vpn gateway either using uh

1103
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,560
stolen uh stolen credentials or by

1104
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,880
exploiting a zero day which we've seen

1105
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,800
there have been alerts from sisa from

1106
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,440
the fbi about attacker

1107
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,680
attack groups exploiting zero days in a

1108
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,160
number of vpn appliances and products

1109
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,079
over the past year so it seems a very

1110
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,200
common uh common

1111
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,560
attack vector

1112
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,839
um

1113
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,920
is that your would that be your advice

1114
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,520
for companies

1115
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,359
applying those same concepts internally

1116
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,200
so you when you think of zero trust

1117
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,680
don't just you know okay you've dealt

1118
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
with the remote side but now apply to

1119
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,160
your internal network as well

1120
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,800
well uh as i said before i do believe

1121
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
that the traditional castle and moat

1122
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,240
security is dead and doesn't apply to

1123
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,599
the modern environments anymore so any

1124
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,599
company that still thinks

1125
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,160
like that will have issues regardless of

1126
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,599
what technologies they start

1127
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,000
implementing and it does go back to that

1128
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,319
mindset shift that you also mentioned it

1129
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,640
does go back to the way you look at

1130
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,720
things and the way you actually make use

1131
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,800
of the technology it's no it's it's not

1132
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,359
just about going to the cloud because

1133
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,760
it's cool and everybody's doing it it's

1134
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,160
because you know it's going to help you

1135
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,400
and you know how it will help you and

1136
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
you know how it will affect your

1137
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,839
internal processes and um and the way

1138
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,440
you do business

1139
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,520
every day and as long as uh people

1140
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,319
fail to to make that jump to change that

1141
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,839
mindset

1142
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,079
no matter what technology you throw at

1143
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,560
the problem it will never be enough and

1144
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,040
it will never solve your actual issues

1145
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,160
so yes i do believe that that the

1146
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
the mindset is important and not just

1147
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,280
the technology and yes we are still

1148
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,920
seeing and i'm still seeing myself and

1149
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,319
there's all the all the reports and all

1150
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,079
the data breaches that are still out

1151
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,000
there with companies saying but hey

1152
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,160
we've done zero trust and we've still

1153
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,200
gotten hacked well yes but if you

1154
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,960
read between the lines and you look at

1155
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,240
how you got hacked at how how the how

1156
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,480
the data breach occurred you'll figure

1157
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,480
out that you are still doing things the

1158
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,680
old way

1159
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,040
and you were

1160
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,240
just

1161
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,640
making it appear that you've changed

1162
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,280
something when you didn't really in fact

1163
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,240
so it's it's also about the behavior

1164
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,560
that needs to change and it's also about

1165
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,920
the users

1166
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,000
understanding these concepts and it's

1167
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,280
not about

1168
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,440
inside or outside anymore

1169
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,560
everything could be on either side and

1170
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,400
you need to account for that and you

1171
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,000
need to check for that and you need to

1172
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,119
protect against that all the time

1173
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,839
everywhere on all devices all the users

1174
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,640
and so on so yeah it's it's certainly

1175
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,040
the way you you you personally uh

1176
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,640
positioned it

1177
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,359
i want to mention here another trend uh

1178
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,920
that has been accelerated by by the

1179
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,400
pandemic or companies

1180
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,280
companies trying to think long term

1181
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,240
about uh the new

1182
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,920
the new status quo basically uh because

1183
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,839
it's safe to say

1184
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,000
many employees will maybe not

1185
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,960
never return to work from to work from

1186
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,520
the office in the same numbers as before

1187
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,040
right

1188
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,480
and there's this new uh cessy uh and

1189
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,520
s-a-s-e for those who do not know what

1190
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,960
it is it's a

1191
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,200
an acronym for secure access service

1192
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,680
edge it's a term coined by uh gartner

1193
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,839
and what it is is the combination of sd1

1194
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,800
with

1195
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,599
cloud-based security where

1196
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,640
the idea is taking all of these hardware

1197
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,960
appliances whether their networking

1198
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,440
appliances or their security appliances

1199
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,640
out of local branches office branches

1200
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,960
and the corporate network and putting

1201
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,319
those same features into the cloud and

1202
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,000
the only thing you need

1203
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,880
is

1204
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,200
basically for all of your traffic to go

1205
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,640
through the code all of your office

1206
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,000
traffic to go through

1207
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,760
to the cloud you do not longer need this

1208
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,280
complicated

1209
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,800
uh network setup right and we've seen

1210
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,880
various companies

1211
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,800
various vendors uh

1212
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
starting to go in that direction there's

1213
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,720
companies like cloudflare

1214
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,960
uh and others that come more from the

1215
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,040
networking side of things or the cdn

1216
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,960
side of things and they want to

1217
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,119
basically become your corporate bank

1218
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,359
corporate network backbone you say link

1219
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,720
all of your

1220
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,040
branch of which is offices to us and

1221
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,280
then you can apply the traffic policies

1222
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,760
the firewall in the future data leak

1223
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,920
prevention everything else from the crop

1224
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,200
from the cloud

1225
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,680
uh instead of you know managing all of

1226
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,599
these local appliances there's other

1227
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,839
vendors that come more from the security

1228
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:08,839
side

1229
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,599
uh and there may be

1230
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,119
lacking a little bit of the network

1231
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,920
inside the sd-wan parts and

1232
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,480
they're signing partnerships together

1233
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,520
uh

1234
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,920
so it's not the idea in the in the end

1235
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,880
would be

1236
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,599
simplification right having just one

1237
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,079
vendor for everything but it's also a

1238
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,960
shift for security teams because it

1239
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,520
means no longer and i t networking teams

1240
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,079
united teams in general you no longer

1241
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,160
need to focus on managing devices

1242
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,920
managing the appliances

1243
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,319
you are more focused on defining

1244
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,440
policies and applying those

1245
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,280
have you seen

1246
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,200
you know interest in that gartner

1247
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,359
estimates that uh

1248
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,520
you know a large number of companies

1249
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,960
will uh

1250
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,119
adopt that or already have plans to move

1251
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,200
in that direction over the the next few

1252
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,520
years by 2025

1253
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,920
they say over 60 percent of enterprises

1254
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,839
will have an explicit strategy and

1255
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,000
timeline for sassy adoption

1256
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,880
by encompassing user branches and

1257
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,640
edge access

1258
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,640
and that will impact obviously the msp

1259
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,520
market as well and the mssp market since

1260
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,559
it's kind of a direct competitor if the

1261
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,240
cloud vendor replaces your need to have

1262
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,359
a security team sort of

1263
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,680
it's more focused on defining policies

1264
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,880
rather than

1265
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,359
than other things

1266
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,599
how do you see that

1267
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,440
christian

1268
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,920
well i actually think sassy

1269
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,119
is here to stay i think it's a you know

1270
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,240
it's a logical solution to what we've

1271
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,880
seen so far i think msps

1272
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,839
are

1273
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,480
especially the ones that are you know

1274
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,960
thinking more into the future and having

1275
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,760
you know

1276
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,640
a more robust cloud adoption uh cloud

1277
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,240
integration strategy they're they're

1278
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,200
extremely welcoming uh welcoming that uh

1279
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,720
there's an education that needs to

1280
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,559
happen around zero trust and around

1281
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,240
sassy

1282
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,400
and you know for them in order in order

1283
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,559
for them to be able to position that

1284
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,319
but i think you know

1285
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,839
at the end of the day

1286
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,200
especially when we're talking about the

1287
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,760
msp market and the smb market it's

1288
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,440
really about

1289
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,280
um

1290
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,640
not

1291
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,160
helping the customers make the right

1292
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,000
decisions so

1293
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,960
being able to impose

1294
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,920
a minimum security stack i think that's

1295
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,800
that's critical for for the success

1296
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,359
of of the collaboration on the long term

1297
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,920
so if you're an msp and you allow

1298
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,400
clients to go around and buy packages

1299
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
that for example don't include the

1300
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,319
minimum building blocks that you

1301
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,400
consider to be necessary to to ensure

1302
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,480
that customer security

1303
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,520
what you do is is you you put yourself

1304
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,319
and the customer in a position

1305
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,880
that is you know going to

1306
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,720
probably lead to some heavier

1307
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,240
discussions down the line when they get

1308
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,880
breached so i think that's an important

1309
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,280
you know establishing this backbone and

1310
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,599
saying there is no way

1311
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,119
around around security so coming back to

1312
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,680
coming back to sassy i think you know

1313
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,000
whenever you do something from scratch

1314
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,400
it it's easy so whenever you promote a

1315
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,680
new solution uh it's easy dealing with

1316
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,160
investments in hardware for example

1317
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,720
and migrating from the

1318
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,720
old landscape to the new landscape

1319
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,720
that's where challenges are are

1320
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,839
appearing

1321
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,240
and most of them are you know related to

1322
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,240
the mindset to the investments already

1323
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,480
done in those you know um in those

1324
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,200
devices people training all of that so

1325
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,359
okay

1326
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,520
i'd say uh there's obviously some

1327
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,640
limitations right now uh no no single

1328
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,119
vendor right now ceci vendor offers

1329
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,119
everything right so you cannot easily

1330
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,079
replace your fire or your dlp your

1331
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,480
uh zero trust maybe zero most of them

1332
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,240
offer zero trust network access that one

1333
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,680
of the pillars but

1334
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,599
then it goes much deeper into that so

1335
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,200
you are not going to be able right now

1336
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,119
to replace all of your

1337
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,839
local appliances or security appliances

1338
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,160
uh but i would say it's maybe more

1339
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,480
attractive for smbs right i'm trying to

1340
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,640
go back to smbs because they seem to

1341
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,599
face

1342
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,359
the bigger challenges because they don't

1343
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,040
have the budget they don't have the

1344
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,359
talent they don't have the big security

1345
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,119
teams they maybe have a few people who

1346
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,280
are doing also i.t administration and

1347
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,960
security on top of it right so

1348
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,160
for them

1349
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,400
this seems like very appealing right

1350
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,000
because i offload i offload that to

1351
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
whatever the cloud vendor or the cloud

1352
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,920
partnership whatever you want to call it

1353
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,000
right so then i just have to connect my

1354
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,760
branch office and

1355
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,240
the vendor is responsible for

1356
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,240
for the security of the infrastructure

1357
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,480
right if all of my traffic goes through

1358
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,839
them obviously

1359
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,920
there's the issues of latency and all

1360
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,880
that that

1361
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,680
some companies like cloudflare or akamai

1362
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,680
or any of the big ones that have servers

1363
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,599
all around the world and all the major

1364
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,599
cities and that sort of thing are able

1365
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,760
to handle better than others or google

1366
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,319
or aws or

1367
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,680
and

1368
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,960
but i'll say

1369
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,240
so that's appealing for smbs

1370
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,800
for sure due to the flexible packaging

1371
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,599
and

1372
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,760
due to the lack of the upfront costs i

1373
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,680
mean most of the enterprise solutions

1374
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,440
that we would

1375
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,800
need

1376
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
to stop the attacks happening in the smb

1377
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,880
market are simply prohibited so you know

1378
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,520
there is no way an smb could afford the

1379
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,599
investments um

1380
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,400
without uh you know there is no way they

1381
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,160
they could do that that's why they

1382
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,480
that's why they're going to to to the

1383
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,640
msps that's why the cloud is a very good

1384
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,839
solution for them

1385
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:00,800
um i think the security market in

1386
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,200
general should be

1387
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,920
should improve their offerings for smbs

1388
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,160
uh

1389
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,760
because they seem they seem to be

1390
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,079
focused on on the big enterprises

1391
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,680
because that's where the money the big

1392
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,280
money is that's where that gets you

1393
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,960
thousands and thousands of foresight

1394
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,040
licenses big contracts that sort of

1395
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,400
thing right but if you are a small shop

1396
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
or a small business that has i don't

1397
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,680
know 30 employees 20 employees and

1398
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,880
you need to do

1399
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,720
you know the job that you are dependent

1400
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,200
on it obviously but you are now also

1401
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,559
facing the

1402
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,520
the apt style ransomware attacks the ap

1403
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,839
style cyber mercenary the apt style

1404
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:44,400
um motivation of financially motivated

1405
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,319
cyber crime groups we know groups like

1406
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,079
carbonart cobalt

1407
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,520
uh fins six fin7 all those groups use

1408
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,040
apt styles

1409
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,800
style techniques they they come into

1410
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,319
your network they sit on your network

1411
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,359
for months you they learn your workflows

1412
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,480
before they actually hit right so

1413
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,319
would you say

1414
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,319
i know in general

1415
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,520
uh

1416
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,359
there should maybe be

1417
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,920
cheaper offerings for smbs should should

1418
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,720
the indus security industry do more

1419
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,400
i'm talking about the security solutions

1420
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,359
industry i think definitely

1421
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,160
we will see more interest coming from

1422
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,720
from the smbs and them

1423
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,599
i mean just being an smb having 10

1424
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,400
people doesn't mean especially looking

1425
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,880
at the worldwide doesn't mean you can't

1426
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,680
you can't do business uh for you know

1427
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,119
100 to a billion dollars you know in in

1428
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,880
in revenue just because you're you're

1429
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,720
small doesn't mean you don't have a

1430
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,280
significant impact so i think definitely

1431
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,160
there is a need for um

1432
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,119
different

1433
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,680
modern tools for for those smbs to solve

1434
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,599
their security challenges

1435
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,480
it's not uh you you can't just copy

1436
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,720
paste the enterprise model into the

1437
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,040
enterprise tools to to this to this

1438
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,640
space

1439
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,799
what about governments and this might be

1440
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,880
you know i've heard opinions and this

1441
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,799
might be slightly controversial right

1442
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:11,599
but

1443
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,119
obviously governments have offered

1444
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,200
companies financial assistance for

1445
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,520
dealing with we've covered or revenue

1446
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,079
loss from kovid

1447
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,280
mostly on the employee side

1448
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,040
and we often hear

1449
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,040
you know the small businesses are the

1450
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,839
pillar of the economy right

1451
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:30,880
but

1452
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,680
they

1453
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,480
when it comes to security they lack the

1454
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,319
budgets they like everything so some

1455
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,680
people are asking

1456
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,359
if if governments care about the economy

1457
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,440
and the small businesses

1458
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,319
they also may security is not a revenue

1459
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,480
it doesn't bring revenue right but it

1460
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,319
protects revenue because if you do get

1461
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,680
breached you might be put out of

1462
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,240
business if you get a ransomware attack

1463
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,000
and you don't have cyber insurance or

1464
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,040
the insurer refuses to pay or anything

1465
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,400
like that it's basically a a business

1466
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,200
uh

1467
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,799
ending event right

1468
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,119
uh or other big data breach that you the

1469
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,280
loss of intellectual property and so on

1470
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,640
and so on so

1471
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,880
do you think uh and this goes to

1472
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,520
everyone on the panel not not just you

1473
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,280
do you think governments should should

1474
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,400
have

1475
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,440
financial assistance programs for smbs

1476
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,960
focused on

1477
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,040
improving their cyber security that

1478
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,720
would allow them to

1479
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,839
maybe buy better services acquire better

1480
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,200
solutions

1481
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,599
uh et cetera like i don't know in

1482
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,319
agriculture agriculture they have this

1483
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,480
financial assistance where they they

1484
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,000
give money to farmers to buy new

1485
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,160
equipment right in order to increase

1486
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,640
their their yields and their production

1487
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,480
right why not for

1488
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,559
you know cyber security what's your your

1489
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:49,839
take on that

1490
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,160
uh i can start on that pretty quickly

1491
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,799
i'm a big fan of free markets so i don't

1492
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,040
think government intervention from this

1493
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,680
perspective is actually beneficial

1494
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,359
i think if there is some government

1495
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:02,799
intervention it should be more on the

1496
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,400
awareness and compliance that's where

1497
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,880
they where they can do the most

1498
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,520
and if i'm looking at

1499
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,599
smbs in general

1500
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,000
i think there there is a lot of a huge

1501
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,440
lack of awareness

1502
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,200
their attention span their management

1503
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,839
attention span on the cyber and i.t

1504
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,000
issues is extremely limited

1505
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,319
and it's unfortunately very reactive so

1506
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,280
they are

1507
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,640
extremely

1508
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,520
interested in solving things um

1509
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,839
very specific when when they

1510
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,079
seem to have an issue or when they

1511
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,319
perceive a threat other than that i

1512
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,960
think that we as a you know on the other

1513
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,040
hand on the you know vendor side and

1514
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,160
security a promoter side we should work

1515
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,040
a lot on helping build those

1516
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,520
rois for security which is very

1517
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,359
difficult to prove

1518
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:54,960
but i think in my opinion this is the

1519
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,520
way forward

1520
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,799
okay

1521
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,720
do you have something

1522
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,599
i i totally agree i think the awareness

1523
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,400
side is what's important here

1524
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,440
and i've rarely seen a case where any

1525
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,440
sort of free money

1526
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,480
um did anything good to

1527
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,280
uh help raise the importance of a

1528
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,599
certain thing it's probably something

1529
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,280
that the companies would just take those

1530
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,720
the the money take those resources

1531
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,799
implement those things not because they

1532
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,200
know they need them but because

1533
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,280
it's there and

1534
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,760
ending up not actually using those

1535
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,799
things as they should use those things

1536
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,680
as opposed to if they were aware of that

1537
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,319
need if they were aware why that's

1538
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,480
needed and why that needs to be part of

1539
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,319
their business plan and their approach

1540
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,000
to how they do

1541
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,079
things daily

1542
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,760
i think it would be much more relevant

1543
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,400
so anything along the lines of

1544
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,520
raising that awareness and educating

1545
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,480
users and companies about

1546
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,599
the the benefits of security in today's

1547
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:04,400
world

1548
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,599
would uh would be of um a much bigger

1549
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,559
impact that any than any sort of uh but

1550
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:11,839
they don't have to be

1551
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,599
they don't have to be mutually exclusive

1552
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,920
right it doesn't mean that

1553
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,200
i'm yeah it's if if you're

1554
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,640
i'm i don't want to go into the whole

1555
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,359
political discussion here uh but if

1556
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,559
you're getting something for free you

1557
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,359
don't perceive the value of that

1558
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,440
and if you just get money to do

1559
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,559
something

1560
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,920
uh

1561
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,640
as opposed to you realizing you need to

1562
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,040
do that something and you putting the

1563
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,400
effort and

1564
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,599
uh setting a site budget for that

1565
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,200
the results are going to be very

1566
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,079
different um and that's

1567
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,520
across the board for any sort of

1568
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,799
giveaway versus uh something that i did

1569
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,000
myself um kind of a thing

1570
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,680
it's the the end results are visible and

1571
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,000
that's why i i also agree with christian

1572
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,960
i don't

1573
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,359
uh i don't think that any sort of

1574
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,760
funding program for this would benefit

1575
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,640
the market at large it would not educate

1576
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,440
the users in actually making use of that

1577
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,640
properly

1578
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,760
um it would be a waste of resources that

1579
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,240
could be put to better use

1580
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,160
in in a different way

1581
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,920
that's that's my opinion and again

1582
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,480
without going into the whole right and

1583
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,960
and i have you know i'm i'm closer

1584
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,640
probably to the u.s market because of

1585
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,799
the publications publication i work for

1586
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:37,200
and i speak with many you know people in

1587
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,599
the us experts in the u.s and

1588
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,599
these issues came up more in the context

1589
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,680
of ransomware right where small

1590
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,920
businesses don't have many options there

1591
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,960
right so

1592
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,480
they were called for the government

1593
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,400
should be doing more including maybe

1594
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,480
financial assistance so that's why i

1595
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,000
wanted to you know throw the question

1596
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,599
out there uh no see where yeah i think i

1597
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,920
think it's a different mindset

1598
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,000
altogether the the way things are

1599
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,400
happening in the us as compared to

1600
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,799
europe and central and eastern europe in

1601
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,880
particular so it's

1602
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,240
again it's a it's a whole different

1603
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,920
discussion

1604
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,480
but i still do believe that awareness is

1605
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,480
more important if those companies had

1606
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,720
known how to better protect themselves

1607
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,400
from ransomware they wouldn't be in a

1608
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,640
position to have to pay up uh

1609
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,040
so not as many i'm not saying that they

1610
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,400
wouldn't have gotten hacked um at all

1611
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,799
but it wouldn't be uh as many or it

1612
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,440
would be as as widespread of a of a

1613
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,520
phenomenon

1614
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,760
okay lukas do you have any thoughts on

1615
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,319
that or

1616
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:45,040
agreeing as well as we switched to

1617
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,559
since as he just mentioned that

1618
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,119
mentality of the us

1619
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,200
and comparing that to mentality in

1620
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,760
europe in central or eastern it's

1621
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,280
totally different

1622
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,440
and it might be misused and the key

1623
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,480
should be education awareness

1624
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,480
um starting maybe not with employees

1625
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,640
starting with schools to create

1626
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,920
employees that have that in mind and

1627
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,240
that should be the first help for these

1628
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,959
ssmbs

1629
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,839
we're getting close to the

1630
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,240
end of the panel here so i want to open

1631
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,559
it up for for you guys to

1632
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,559
you know make some closing remarks uh

1633
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,319
maybe about something that you wanted to

1634
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,319
say when we haven't covered

1635
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,880
uh with these questions that i had

1636
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,079
uh

1637
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,280
is anyone does anyone want to to start i

1638
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,599
actually have one thing that i really

1639
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,839
wanted to to talk with you guys today

1640
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,000
and it is about

1641
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,680
um the

1642
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,400
number one thing that we're seeing

1643
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,400
being used in all the attacks that are

1644
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,480
happening have happened

1645
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,160
throughout the last two years

1646
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,559
and that is spearfishing and you know

1647
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,960
the initial coming in entry point which

1648
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,680
is through the email so i think that's

1649
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,160
i mean if that's that's about you know

1650
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,480
probably 90 of the attacks have that

1651
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,280
component so i think it's a really

1652
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,079
critical component that's not properly

1653
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:09,920
addressed by most by by the entire

1654
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,839
market right now if we take a look at

1655
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,079
the impacts we've got companies from

1656
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:14,960
like

1657
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,480
top tech companies

1658
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,200
down to the smb governments everybody's

1659
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,720
you know everybody's being being

1660
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,599
attacked

1661
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,839
and the initial attack vector is is

1662
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:26,240
emails

1663
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,039
yeah very true

1664
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,920
most of the weather whether you know apt

1665
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,720
whether ransomware whether anything

1666
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,160
spearfishing and fishing in general

1667
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,559
you know is an ongoing problem and has

1668
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,720
been for many many years

1669
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,319
obviously that hasn't changed during the

1670
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,960
pandemic at all if anything has probably

1671
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,160
increased

1672
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,400
a lot like

1673
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,280
hundreds of people

1674
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,520
yeah totally agree with christian and i

1675
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:56,400
think

1676
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,039
going back to his point in the beginning

1677
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,599
about security hygiene it all boils down

1678
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,319
to that it does go back to the user

1679
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,960
education into helping users understand

1680
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,559
why they shouldn't use the same password

1681
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,319
everywhere because

1682
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,319
along with spear phishing you've got

1683
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,880
password spraying and you've got these

1684
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,640
huge password dumps all over the

1685
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,200
internet where if you've got your

1686
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,599
account hacked on one site but you're

1687
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,520
using the same password on 20 other

1688
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,920
sites it doesn't matter how secure those

1689
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,160
sites are if you're not doing things

1690
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,839
right so it all goes back to that and uh

1691
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,400
that's the that's the key here to to

1692
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,319
becoming more aware of

1693
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:39,200
how technology impacts our lives how

1694
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,400
privacy

1695
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,280
uh

1696
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,200
is is uh

1697
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,760
everywhere in what we do every day

1698
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,319
whether we're on social media and doing

1699
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,240
taking a photo and posting it on

1700
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,440
instagram or reading a company email

1701
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,839
it's it's everywhere and until you

1702
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,240
understand that whatever affects you as

1703
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,520
a person

1704
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,000
also affects the the company you work

1705
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,480
for in very much the same way

1706
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,640
this is a problem that will not go away

1707
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,400
and um

1708
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,280
just a quick shameless plug since it's

1709
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,319
related to the to the talk i did mention

1710
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,240
i do have a

1711
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,480
zero trust session later on where i go

1712
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,280
into

1713
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,839
a bit more detail than what we

1714
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,160
managed to do during the panel

1715
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,240
for whoever is interested

1716
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,240
right and on the credential staffing

1717
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,000
that you just mentioned i want to

1718
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,200
quickly mention

1719
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,359
a big increase in attacks against apis

1720
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:37,680
so don't don't just think of it in terms

1721
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,640
of you know web application login forms

1722
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,799
but now many applications

1723
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,359
have apis that communicate to each other

1724
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,000
via apis and there's many attacks

1725
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,240
against apis because they have less

1726
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,319
protections than the traditional login

1727
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,799
forms they don't have necessarily

1728
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,480
two-factor authentication they use

1729
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,400
access tokens so

1730
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,079
it's very important for companies to

1731
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:01,839
look at that and protect those tokens as

1732
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,559
well make sure they protect those tokens

1733
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,240
lukas do you have any

1734
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,760
anything you want to add any closing

1735
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,280
remarks

1736
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,039
um i would focus on a mobile world since

1737
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,359
we are having this social distance and

1738
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,520
because of that we spend more times

1739
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,359
cruising the internet and it's super

1740
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,359
convenient to spend that time on our

1741
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,680
smartphone with big screens on our

1742
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,799
tablets

1743
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,240
and because of that we might end up

1744
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,280
with bad apps phishing etc being

1745
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,280
delivered through social media watching

1746
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,160
videos clicking on the links in comments

1747
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,000
etc

1748
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,680
because of that

1749
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,760
i believe we should think twice what we

1750
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,200
are doing what we are tapping and

1751
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,640
i believe

1752
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,200
our smartphones is having for the last

1753
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,240
year and a half more apps than before

1754
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,480
so we should think twice when we

1755
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,400
download these applications and i would

1756
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,760
suggest

1757
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,079
for users before downloading any app no

1758
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,280
matter which system you are using um

1759
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,280
check the permissions and read the

1760
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,039
review read the comments from other

1761
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:11,440
users that downloaded the applications

1762
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,680
before since there were bad apps found

1763
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,799
on these stores as well

1764
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,000
okay

1765
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,440
well i think we're

1766
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,440
out of time uh i'd like to thank

1767
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,039
everyone on the panel for taking the

1768
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,039
time to

1769
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:26,720
come and share their insights with us

1770
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,520
and the community and i'd like to thank

1771
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,680

1772
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,000
watchers the viewers for uh you know

1773
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,319
attending this panel and i hope it was

1774
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,160
an engaging and interesting conversation

1775
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,400
we obviously it's a very

1776
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,119
uh big topic we could talk about it for

1777
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,079
hours and we wouldn't run out of issues

1778
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,000
and problems and challenges

1779
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,839
but uh that's all of the time we have

1780
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,160
for today i don't want to take uh more

1781
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,160
time from your lunch break and thanks

1782
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,359
everyone andrada andres or sorry andre

1783
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:58,640
sorry it's uh

1784
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,240
no worries no worries there are two of

1785
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,720
us and we're so similar so don't worry

1786
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,400
that's a that's a compliment i take it

1787
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,400
as a compliment thank you so much lucian

1788
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,160
thank you to everyone who participated

1789
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,400
on the panel for all of the lessons that

1790
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,960
you've shared i think that you know

1791
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,760
i think that people need um

1792
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,319
examples to feel kind of less alone and

1793
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,920
there are challenges uh so many

1794
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,759
specialists and both i.t and security

1795
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:26,238
have tried to you know in the past year

1796
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:28,560
do their very best and sometimes that

1797
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,479
feels like it's not enough simply

1798
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,439
because there's so much to do so fast so

1799
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,920
i think that it's important to kind of

1800
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,839
practice a little self-compassion and

1801
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:39,439
self-empathy and figure out that

1802
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,600
everyone's doing their best which i

1803
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,759
truly believe so thank you so much to

1804
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,479
everyone
