1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,280
so as you have probably heard so much

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,960
effort is being put into building

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,759
quantum computers by the likes of google

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,240
nasa and others and it's just a matter

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,759
of time before the currently used

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,599
digital signatures are going to become

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,719
obsolete

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,440
fortunately we have maxim javic here a

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,600
professor and head of cyber security

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,080
direction at the caucus university he

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,680
also serves as president of the

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,560
scientific cyber security association

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,080
he will help us skip ahead into the

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
future and learn about a post-quantum

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,760
scheme maxim the mike's all yours

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
today today

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,360
we're gonna talk

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,079
about the post quantum scheme

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,680
where we integrate it where we

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,000
integrated the novel random number

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,920
generation and we created that new

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,199
certification method and we have and we

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,800
have also

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,600
integrated it into our schema here we

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,399
have the implementations the technical

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
review and all this stuff

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,760
so let us make let us make very very

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,880
very quick very very quick introduction

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
into cryptography just everybody to

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,200
follow me

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,720
here is ellis our cryptographic hero

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
here is mr bob and they need to

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
communicate to communicate securely

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,080
so alice has the key somehow she can

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
generate it how she generates we will

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,600
work today a lot about it and afterwards

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,479
afterwards she sends this kid with a pop

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,600
somehow

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,439
somehow

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,840
they exchange the game

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,759
so

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,200
ellis has some message she gonna encrypt

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,000
it

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
and

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,360
after encrypting after recruiting she

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,560
gets the cipher so she encrypts it by

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,280
means of the key

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
here is a cider going to bob

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,000
here is our book he takes the cipher

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
decrypts it

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,240
she has he has a decryption algorithm he

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,399
uses kiki and the cipher and the grips

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,319
and decrypts the cipher the main

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,640
is the interesting part is that here is

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
mr hacker mr attacker which is

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,560
eavesdropping is dropping the cipher and

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,319
is trying to understand what is going on

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,599
so

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
the main part that decryption process

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,239
must invert the encryption process so

61
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,920
after we encrypted the key by the same

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
message

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,840
after we encrypted the message by the

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,000
same key

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,239
decrypting it with the same key must

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,280
give us must give us our message back

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,239
okay oh there is a issue there is a

68
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,120
notion of perfect secrecy it is when the

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
hacker looks

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,959
looks at the message

71
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
as a cipher he mustn't understand any

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,879
additional information about the message

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,680
so the cipher mustn't leak mustn't leak

74
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,360
any information to the hacker so how it

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,879
works it uses xor where it's bitwise

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,720
operation one xor one gives us one zero

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,120
x or zero gives us zero one extra zero

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
gives us

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,239
one one extra one gives us one and so on

80
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,040
so

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,080
uh here we have the message space which

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,560
consists of bits zero and once we have

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,760
the key and

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,720
both are poster of the length n we

85
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,519
encrypt the message by means of the key

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,200
using

87
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,680
using the xor the actual of the key in

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,760
the message and

89
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,239
decrypt to invoke inverted process we

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,920
use a decryption

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,959
so we use wax or as the same key with a

92
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,760
cipher of course it is true we can look

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,560
at it like this so first of all first of

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
all we

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
can encrypt we can encrypt the message

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
by xoring k and the message and decrypt

97
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
it by means of xoring

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,439
it with a key back key extor key

99
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,680
gives us zero and we are left with a

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,959
message so

101
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,680
it really it really inverts it really

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,079
involves the process as you can see it

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,560
in one time parts a message the key and

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
the cipher must be of the same length

105
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,199
cipher of course will be of the same

106
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
length because message and the key are

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
of the same lengths

108
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,240
one time pad is perfectly secure why

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
it's not used in practice why it's not

110
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,680
used in practice it was used it was used

111
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
but oh it has very big two limitations

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,080
so because of which it is not used it

113
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,199
isn't used in practice and it has two

114
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,000
great problems the first one is that the

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
key size as we said might be as a

116
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
message of the same length

117
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,280
and

118
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,479
in the real life we have very very long

119
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,039
messages so the key might be also very

120
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,320
long and of course it's not efficient to

121
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,120
start such a begin such a big key is a

122
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,240
memory

123
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,639
another problem is another problem is

124
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,560
that it's one time but one time so for

125
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,960
encrypting every message we need the

126
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
unique unique

127
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,960
okay

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,120
we talked about perfect secrecy let us

129
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,080
define perfect indistinguishability

130
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,960
here

131
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,400
we have

132
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,880
two algorithms the key generation

133
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
algorithm encryption and decryption

134
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,280
algorithm peace our schema so

135
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,600
we take two messages

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,880
we take two messages we randomly encrypt

137
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
one of them by means of the key and of

138
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,880
course of course we give we get some

139
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,080
cipher

140
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,520
and

141
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,039
say adversary the attacker does not know

142
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,840
does not know which one is encrypted

143
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,160
so he must guess you must guess which

144
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,759
message was encrypted the first one or

145
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,560
the second one and and

146
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,000
if the hacker can guess randomly can

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,400
guess with the probability then

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
one and a half

149
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,000
this means that means that he cannot he

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,319
cannot understand he cannot understand

151
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,720
which message was encrypted so he just

152
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
guessed he just gets with the

153
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
probability one half

154
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,120
and it means that the scheme is

155
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,759
perfectly indistinguishable

156
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,960
so

157
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,680
so to make it more concretely here is uh

158
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,600
how it works uh

159
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,440
so attacker outputs to messages

160
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,039
that he generated

161
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,759
and one of the messages is encrypted and

162
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,240
the hacker must understand which message

163
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,000
is encrypted if he succeeds

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,479
with the probability more than one half

165
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,479
the scheme is not perfectly

166
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,639
indistinguishable so

167
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,800
we can write set probability of winning

168
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
of winning this experiment what does it

169
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,840
mean winning so meaning means that

170
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,319
the experiment evaluates to one so the

171
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
hacker the hacker could could

172
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,319
distinguish which message was encrypted

173
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,840
with the probability with the

174
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,199
probability one-half so if it if it's

175
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,759
okay it means that the schematic

176
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,960
perfectly distributable

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
and the scheme is perfectly

178
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,919
distinguishable if it is perfectly

179
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,960
secret

180
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,039
what does it mean guys it means that

181
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,800
it's the same notions

182
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,039
perfect perfect secrecy is the same that

183
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,360
perfectly distinguishability just from

184
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,120
the different different side

185
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
so

186
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,319
what is computational security

187
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,960
competition secrecy is what is really

188
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
used today in the real life because

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,240
perfect secrecy

190
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,520
is

191
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,560
too

192
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,319
too difficult to achieve

193
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
and it's not realistic in today's uh

194
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
in today's life for example when we get

195
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,919
quantum computer and get quantum key

196
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,400
distribution of course of course we will

197
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,120
be able to use it but

198
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,560
but

199
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
for now computer

200
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
computational secrecy is much

201
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,479
closer to us there are two approaches of

202
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,880
computational secrecy the first one is

203
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,679
concrete concrete and another one is

204
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,399
asymptotic

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
so

206
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,958
so

207
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,640
let us talk quickly

208
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,600
about the concrete version so

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
so

210
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,680
here we assume

211
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,640
that

212
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
the hacking can guess

213
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
which message was encrypted from the

214
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
store

215
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
and with a beat with a bit higher

216
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,959
probability than one half

217
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,839
so

218
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,200
with some negligible epsilon which is a

219
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,720
really realism tiny and the tiny

220
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,160
pendulum

221
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
and

222
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,040
so the probability that he will win the

223
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,200
experiment the probability that he will

224
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
win the experiment will be less or local

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
than 100 plus

226
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,320
some epsilon

227
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,040
so it is a concrete version if we are

228
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
talking about asymptotic version we said

229
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,720
that there are two versions you are

230
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
talking about asymptotic version here

231
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
epsilon is not value but it is

232
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,959
functional nothing more

233
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,160
um

234
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
let us talk about observed random number

235
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,519
generators which are very wary and very

236
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
important notions in our life

237
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,880
so

238
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,080
so

239
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,080
it's some algorithm g which takes input

240
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,640
so-called seed and outputs the input

241
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,839
which is longer

242
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,079
longer longer than so output is longer

243
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,600
than the input the input is the input is

244
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,320
uh

245
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,079
usually random the cnc is really random

246
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,920
and the output gonna be sevdo random

247
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,839
here how it works is illustrated very

248
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,399
well here we get the seed

249
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,440
we

250
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,480
apply it to the generator prng except

251
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,880
the random number generator and we get

252
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,680
the output which is as you can see here

253
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,959
it can be seen here bigger than the seat

254
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,760
okay

255
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,399
that means this we can improve improve

256
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,560
our observed one-time pad

257
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,600
we can

258
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,920
take the key which is smaller than the

259
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,000
message the key is smaller in the

260
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,160
message we can supply

261
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
save the random number generator to it

262
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,519
and can get the saved or save the random

263
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,000
key which will be already of the size of

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
the message

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
and here card we can improve the random

266
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,519
number generator so the first the first

267
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,680
limitation

268
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,720
now is already not limitation but

269
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,079
of course here the scheme is already not

270
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
perfectly secured it's already

271
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,279
computationally secret because

272
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,640
we

273
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,120
support it we imported the

274
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,839
notion of computational in computational

275
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,440
security

276
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
so

277
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,640
after what we got the revolution it was

278
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,560
symmetric encryption everything is good

279
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,800
we have only one key by means of this we

280
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
encrypt decrypt everything is symmetric

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,519
and and

282
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,320
we have got we have got the public

283
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,560
encryption where we have our hero alice

284
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
she generates already tookies publicly

285
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,839
and secret him to kiss

286
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
and

287
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,160
we have bobbum so what does this she

288
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,399
puts publicly to some

289
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,000
public public repositories and bob can

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,480
get it can get it from this repository

291
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
and encrypt his message and encrypt his

292
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,680
message by means of this public game

293
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,079
now as you can see he encrypts realism

294
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,120
message with a public kid and sends this

295
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,959
message to mrs ellis

296
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,920
decipher this encrypted message to mrs

297
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,040
ellis

298
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,000
alice receives receives a message and

299
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,560
now only she

300
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,440
can decrypt it why because because she

301
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,560
has the decryption gear so she decrypts

302
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,800
so she decrypts a message and decrypts

303
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,120
the cipher and gets her message back

304
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
for now

305
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,600
we use rsa rsa encryption which is

306
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,399
widely used today in practice here

307
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,399
we generate an ent

308
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,090
and is a

309
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,639
[Music]

310
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,279
multiplication of two prime numbers

311
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,800
and public key is n and e

312
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
and secret key is t

313
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,880
so

314
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
the public of course is passed to mrs

315
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,480
ellis

316
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
and me alice can encrypt encrypt the

317
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,560
message by means of public gear

318
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,240
by it by raising it to the power of e

319
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,200
and taking modena she gets a cipher

320
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,079
how

321
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,639
bob can decrypt the cipher very easily

322
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,040
he can race it to the power of secret

323
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,839
okay

324
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,200
everything is good the classical

325
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,839
cryptography is wonderful but

326
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,519
oh here what computer scammer

327
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,320
we began to work on it when we saw that

328
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,040
google has signed the contract with the

329
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,160
wave

330
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,800
anyway it is the manufacturer of quantum

331
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,040
co processors

332
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,639
who have cubits who have qubits and

333
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,040
quantum computer can break

334
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,959
all almost all public key crypt systems

335
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,720
which are used which are used today in

336
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,760
the real life for example for example

337
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,279
they can break their say and there is a

338
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,800
part of

339
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,519
microsoft operating systems apple

340
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,360
sa noel it is used in all of them the

341
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
systems it is

342
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,720
used in hardware performance

343
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,600
of phones internet network cards smart

344
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,120
cards it is a part of the protocols

345
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,519
like ssl s1 https of course which we use

346
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,320
every day in every online our life will

347
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,600
be hacked by quantum computers

348
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,399
oh

349
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,880
and as we can see google is very

350
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
seriously working working on this issue

351
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
to create new and new quantum computers

352
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,880
in 2019 google has announced that they

353
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,839
have reached something called quantum

354
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,199
supremacy

355
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,440
they have published a paper in nature

356
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,800
journal

357
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,480
and

358
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
they call their computer sycamore and

359
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,760
they say

360
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,959
that it can solve really really

361
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,040
difficult problem in 200 seconds

362
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,800
they compare it to the competitor ibm

363
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,959
and say that ibm's computer is really

364
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,160
huge it is of the size of two of two

365
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,040
basketball courts and

366
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,639
it needs 10 000 years to solve this same

367
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,519
problem what is quantum supremacy for

368
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,399
today our computers work using classical

369
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,600
physics yes newton's physics and

370
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,399
quantum computer will use

371
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,199
the power of quantum physics

372
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,240
so

373
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,639
google said that they have achieved

374
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,519
something like quantum supremacy ibm

375
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,480
didn't like didn't like this news ibm

376
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,440
didn't like this news so

377
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
they have

378
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,639
published that

379
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,839
google eyes and the summit computer

380
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,560
doesn't need 10 000 years to solve the

381
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,440
concrete task but

382
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
it needs only

383
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,639
two hours a day

384
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,519
but

385
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,920
two hours

386
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,800
no two days and a half two days and a

387
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,920
half and of course if google's computer

388
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
can make it really quickly and they need

389
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
to they say they have there is quantum

390
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,759
superposition at the time i read a lot

391
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
of reviews of different experts and

392
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
there was quantum supremacy but

393
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
if you get quantum computer you are one

394
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,720
of the most you are one of the most

395
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
powerful person in the world you can

396
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,759
break everything so all the countries

397
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,920
america china russia everybody is trying

398
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,560
to create their quantum computers so

399
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,360
chinese are not far away

400
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,959
so they have published that have that

401
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:47,839
have

402
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,079
reached they have reached quantum

403
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,600
advantage

404
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,160
in two mainstream roles

405
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,279
they said

406
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,800
that they have reached the advantage in

407
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,040
superconducting

408
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,880
quantum computing

409
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
and photonics quantum computing

410
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,240
technology

411
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,760
which made the china the only country

412
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,240
who achieved the quantum computational

413
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,959
advantage in two in two mainstream

414
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,880
technical roles

415
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,679
one u.s has reached only

416
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,839
in one in one

417
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,959
so

418
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,760
jihadian if i pronounce it correctly

419
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,640
is 10 million times faster than the

420
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,000
current fastest supercomputer and its

421
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,480
calculation complexity

422
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,280
is more than one billion times higher

423
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,240
than google's computer sycomorphora it

424
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
is much it might be fsi that is the

425
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,120
first time

426
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,799
when china has reached something

427
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,840
who

428
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,120
like

429
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
super conducting

430
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
like super conducting

431
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
so

432
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,880
advanced team also built a new light

433
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,679
based quantum computers prototype

434
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,799
which is called the choose hunt to zero

435
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,280
which

436
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,120
detected 114 photons which a good result

437
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,960
which is a very good result

438
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,080
and it can implement a large-scale

439
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,679
gaussian ball

440
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,760
boson sampling

441
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,039
one septillion times faster than the

442
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,480
first and the most most fastest and fast

443
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,360
computer super computer in the world

444
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
and the unsaid

445
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,240
that the detect detection of photons has

446
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,880
really increased from 76 to 113 it's a

447
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,600
very big it's a very big difference it's

448
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,080
a very big advantage

449
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,120
so

450
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,559
so

451
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,240
this computer was built into 2020

452
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
by pen and loon and demonstrated a

453
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,840
quantum advantage

454
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,280
of course the scientists work about

455
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,240
creating nsa alternatives so they have

456
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
created hpg based digital signature

457
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,559
schemes we talked a lot about this today

458
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,400
they used the

459
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
collision resistance of the hash

460
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
function

461
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,440
also they are a code based public

462
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,760
encryption encryption systems for

463
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,880
example macales offers a system which

464
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
uses which uses a matrixes generator max

465
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,320
metrics is

466
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,039
uh

467
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
error correction and all this stuff to

468
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,080
encrypt and decrypt the messages in

469
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,960
quantum secure way

470
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,360
also they are latest based latest based

471
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,160
cryptosystems usually i'll work a lot on

472
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,080
them but i will not talk about this

473
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,120
today

474
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,679
and they are based on the worst worst

475
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,039
case hardness

476
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,640
and multivariate public key

477
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,799
cryptosystems are very difficult it's

478
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,600
very difficult stuff

479
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,480
they have a set of quadratic polynomials

480
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,720
over a finite field

481
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,600
and the security assumption is backed by

482
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,840
empty hardness of the problem to solve

483
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,559
these nonlinear equations and it's very

484
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,720
difficult to find the mathematicians who

485
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,120
are good in this oh it's a difficult

486
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,280
field

487
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,000
okay the alternatives we have why do we

488
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
continue to work why we are doing our

489
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,880
best to create something new because

490
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,840
still we have the successful attacks

491
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,320
the successful attacks on the systems

492
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
for example basic candidate of dublin

493
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,360
city university nel costigan

494
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,520
together with the support of his

495
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,559
professor of his professor michael scott

496
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,120
she has successfully

497
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,640
carried out an attack on the algorithm

498
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,520
on the algorithm and they needed 8 000

499
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,039
hours of cpu to successfully to

500
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,200
successfully implement this attack

501
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,880
with the scientists afterwards answered

502
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,720
that the key is too small it must be

503
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,480
enlarged and so on

504
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
and it might be emphasized that this

505
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,159
system cannot be used to to encrypt the

506
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,720
same message twice and to encrypt the

507
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,400
messages when it's

508
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,559
uh known the correlation between them

509
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,480
also efficiencies were important for

510
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,720
today google already with difficulty

511
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
works with today's cryptography

512
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,320
can you imagine what will be here if

513
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,880
this cryptography is slower

514
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,120
and

515
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,159
inefficient cryptography can be okay for

516
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,960
users but for the servers which process

517
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,280
a lot of tasks in a second

518
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,520
it will be it will be unacceptable

519
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,039
so

520
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,760
end of also the scheme is created after

521
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,080
what it might be implemented so a lot of

522
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,600
years

523
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,919
for this we have to build we have to be

524
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,120
prepared

525
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,560
so

526
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,799
[Music]

527
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,000
also also

528
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,919
must be must be analyzed yes taking into

529
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,400
account because they are aware

530
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,520
of

531
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,640
rsa after only after attack on a years

532
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,559
they have implemented intel has

533
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,120
implemented is instructions to cpu

534
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,080
so

535
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,960
uh and uh on patterson algorithm they

536
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
exist they exist so

537
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,440
like genetics

538
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,080
so let us talk quickly about hedge-based

539
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,720
hash-based digital signature schema

540
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,440
because they are needed because digital

541
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,200
signatures which are used in practice

542
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,159
are vulnerable vulnerable to the attacks

543
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,159
of quantum computers

544
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,000
and the scientists are working very

545
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
seriously on development

546
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,640
of

547
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,960
alternatives of these signatures that

548
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,200
they based around the example of that

549
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,840
one so lampard lenferd has offered one

550
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,679
time signature how it works it gets

551
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,840
the signature key which consists of two

552
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,640
n

553
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,919
lines of uh

554
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,760
or to a number of lines of the length n

555
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,159
which are

556
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,080
random and

557
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,159
they use verification key verification

558
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,919
keys

559
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,000
by applying one way function to the

560
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,280
signature key

561
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,840
and it looks like this to sign the

562
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,440
message

563
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,240
we

564
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,919
will look at the signature so

565
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,880
and

566
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,960
look at the first bit is the first part

567
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,240
is zero we take the first signature key

568
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,159
from the first pair

569
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,919
if it is one we take the second

570
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,200
afterwards so

571
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,679
we do it like this

572
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,159
to verify the document we first of all

573
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,480
apply one way function to the signature

574
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,919
back and afterwards verify this equation

575
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,200
if it's okay

576
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,440
it means that everything is okay

577
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,360
well okay here the signature is very big

578
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,640
and the keys are also very big 50 times

579
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,559
50 times larger than in the case of rsa

580
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,600
so

581
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,480
so winter needs support offered one time

582
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,200
signature scheme to reduce to reduce the

583
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,640
size

584
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,720
but one time signatures cannot be used

585
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,799
in practice because every for every

586
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,240
signature new key and all this stuff so

587
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,679
has offered

588
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,720
has offered the new schema for the new

589
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,600
schema where where

590
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,559
which one public key way he has look the

591
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,120
three that's real this is a public key

592
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,080
and

593
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,000
with one public in two to the age if the

594
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,400
height of the tree say two to the age to

595
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,520
to the age uh messages can be encrypted

596
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,840
so when

597
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,000
apply we get the verification keys

598
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
afterwards we hatch them and get these

599
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
nodes

600
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
to get the next node we concatenate

601
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,320
concatenate two nodes

602
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,840
and hash smoke

603
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,039
if we begin with this note and go up

604
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,200
this is already brother node for this

605
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,559
afterwards this is brother note of

606
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,440
season so one so to sign the message

607
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
first of all we sign it using one time

608
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,640
signature or lampard or internet and

609
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
after and after all

610
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
we sign it we get our public key

611
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,960
so signature contains public key the

612
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,679
index of the node where we begin all the

613
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,080
browser nodes if by means of this we

614
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,679
first verify verify one time signature

615
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,679
and afterwards we verify the public key

616
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,320
okay to generate a publicly we need to

617
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,440
calculate two to the age players of one

618
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
time keys and it's very inefficient in

619
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,960
practice to store so many keys so many

620
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,679
keys so the scientists offered to use

621
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,880
seven random number generators

622
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,000
to

623
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,640
to to store on this asset

624
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
to store only the seat

625
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
it works like following it gets a seat

626
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
outputs to random numbers and they are

627
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,799
after what's used as a signature

628
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
but but

629
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,799
integration of sheltered generator is a

630
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,120
difficult task because a lot of cellular

631
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,520
number generators which were secured in

632
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,279
classical cryptography

633
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,760
they can be broken by quantum computers

634
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,520
so it's a very

635
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,520
it might be very cleverly cleverly

636
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,600
selected the

637
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,400
efficient and secure field random number

638
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
generator so

639
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,000
so

640
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,960
here

641
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,400
we offer to use hd prg it's very

642
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,360
efficient it uses hashes like in our

643
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,159
mercury one by function

644
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,120
and

645
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,760
it's a it's a standard of list so we use

646
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,039
we offer to use it but we need the seed

647
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,679
for the random number generator and here

648
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,960
we used to use a quantum sheet

649
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,159
in 1961 the researchers offered to use

650
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,840
quantum phenomena as a source of

651
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,080
randomness

652
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,400
and they will begin

653
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,600
acting on it

654
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
and make miller tubes we are already

655
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,720
sensitive to capture and amplify alpha

656
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,360
beta and gamma radiation and well

657
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,279
characterized radioactive

658
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,159
detector a single particle makes an

659
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,159
ionization event

660
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,640
that is amplified in a townsend

661
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
avalanche

662
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,480
so

663
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,679
all when quantum random number

664
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,559
generators based on radio active decay

665
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,640
have many common features they use

666
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
digital counters to convert the voltage

667
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,880
from detector into random values

668
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,720
so we can use or quick lock or

669
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,520
fast

670
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,200
lock to generate random numbers

671
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,559
both employee

672
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,039
approaches are used in practice

673
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,520
so opti let us talk about optical which

674
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,120
are really modern today optical quantum

675
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
random number generators and

676
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,320
almost all existing quantum random

677
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
number generators are based on quantum

678
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,679
optics

679
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,600
so

680
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
they use this slide properties and by

681
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,480
means of this your random number are

682
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,120
generated

683
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,240
so time of arrival generators use the

684
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,240
fixers fixers or photons they

685
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,520
calculate a number that period between

686
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,919
the detection of photons

687
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,240
and they can calculate two periods if

688
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,760
one is bigger than the second one they

689
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,240
generate one if not no if not zero they

690
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,080
will exist

691
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,440
uh so

692
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,080
the scientists offered the improvements

693
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,240
the improvements of it

694
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,799
of them and first of all

695
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,799
photon count in quantum random number

696
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,159
generators assigned more than one p b

697
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,640
during each measurement and it makes it

698
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
it makes it much more much more secure

699
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,120
much more efficient

700
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,080
and

701
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
a donated pulse quantum random number

702
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
generators are based on the simplified

703
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,799
version of the previous methods because

704
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,799
they have very few requirements for the

705
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,480
detectors so we used we used all these

706
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,039
all these improvements

707
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,080
of random number generators and

708
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,880
integrated it into our schema so our

709
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,360
schema generates

710
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,039
many bits for one measurement and it

711
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,919
doesn't it has a very few requirements

712
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,520
for detectors and we offer to use this

713
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,960
our

714
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,000
seed created by by our noble quantum

715
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,880
random generator

716
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,919
of as a seed of

717
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,279
hash

718
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,120
of our segmented number generator http

719
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,080
okay theoretical acceptors can generate

720
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,240
can generate an

721
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,480
ed ideal yes a random beat because a

722
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,600
photon has a 50 percent probability that

723
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,919
the beam will split and 50 percent

724
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,240
probability that the beam will reflect

725
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,320
but it's only terror in practice it's

726
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,640
not like this because there are a lot of

727
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,440
biases so afterwards the certification

728
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,480
methods

729
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,399
is needed to

730
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,360
to check the randomness

731
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,760
uh there are two approaches main one

732
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,919
self-testing in quantum random number

733
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,240
generation and the structure of a

734
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,799
self-testing is based on device

735
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,720
independently witnesses quantum

736
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,880
entanglement of non-locality by

737
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,200
absorbing a violation of the balance

738
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,880
inequality

739
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,000
but depends on the hardware so if the

740
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,039
hardware can noise has noise

741
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,520
we can still get a lower bound of the

742
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
amount on the amount of genuine

743
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,360
randomness based on the amount of

744
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,760
non-locality absorbed

745
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,440
approach is to use the wise independent

746
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,919
quantum random generators

747
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,880
because here we can not to care about

748
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,120
the hardware we absolutely ignore the

749
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,080
hardware we look only at output also

750
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,799
this we combined made the hybrid

751
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,240
approach

752
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
and

753
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,440
our

754
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,840
our

755
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,080
new certification method offers a self

756
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,320
semi self-testing quantum random number

757
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,159
generator that combines acceptable

758
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,640
features of self-testing and device

759
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,320
independent

760
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,360
we

761
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,159
integrated integrated all this into our

762
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,360
schema

763
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,480
we integrated our parent gm our random

764
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,120
number generator and everything in this

765
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,519
game else is the same and also

766
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,840
integrated our certification method

767
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,760
oh and the certification signature

768
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,799
verification works as before

769
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,600
and the scheme is secure why because prg

770
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,480
is any standard it's

771
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,279
all

772
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,480
based on hash and hash is used in all of

773
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,159
us

774
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,440
and

775
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,519
our

776
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,840
seed is random number is a quantum

777
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,279
random number

778
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,519
and it has that except a good

779
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,559
certification method

780
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,279
being this year at spain in spain at

781
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,440
walliadoid university

782
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,919
they have the quantum library and i had

783
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,360
the opportunity to check to check our

784
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,000
results and

785
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,760
they really worked

786
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,960
so

787
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,640
i also know here is the end of my report

788
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
we have a scientific cyber security

789
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,039
journal all of you welcome welcome to

790
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,480
publisher papers it's free and it is

791
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
it will be very good for us for our

792
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,880
community if you share your experience

793
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,840
also

794
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,799
we have

795
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,399
we have implementation of the approach

796
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,279
uh

797
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,000
you can see we have it in python you can

798
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,120
see that it really works

799
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,840
and

800
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,000
of course it's created with the models

801
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,880
it has a random number seed which

802
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,440
generates more than one bit at a time

803
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,840
and everything what i was talking about

804
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,559
is used in our implementation

805
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,240
okay

806
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,799
i think

807
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,840
this is

808
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,240
what i had to tell you thank you so much

809
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,760
maxim we really enjoyed your

810
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,360
presentation

811
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,320
um i uh i have a couple of questions if

812
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,159
you wouldn't mind expanding more on what

813
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,000
you have just presented

814
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,480
do you feel like right now we are in a

815
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,559
place where we are confident in the post

816
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,559
quantum schemes that we have devised

817
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,480
theoretically would you say they're

818
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,480
ready to be implemented on a large scale

819
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,600
no

820
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
not yet not yet

821
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,559
because of it we have new standards

822
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,799
and we have a lot of competitions for

823
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,120
example neutral is a very good was a

824
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,360
very good candidate it passed

825
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,880
a third round it's the latest base

826
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,559
crypto system they are still

827
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,600
some

828
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,240
approaches of rent generating random

829
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,239
numbers and those stuff which are

830
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,479
considered quantum secure but

831
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,239
even even on the startup systems like

832
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,159
ies and rsa are still zx so the time is

833
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,800
needed the time is needed to check all

834
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,159
of this but before the scheme is not any

835
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,719
standard i claim that you mustn't

836
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,480
mustn't use it

837
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,560
yeah it makes a lot of sense

838
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,599
um

839
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,199
and uh i think i would like to follow

840
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,918
this up with the second question you

841
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,239
mentioned uh something about the

842
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,639
unreliability of detectors when it comes

843
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,760
to optical quantum phenomena do you have

844
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,239
any personal anxieties relating to using

845
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,480
these phenomena to generate

846
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,639
random numbers

847
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,520
uh

848
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,280
so

849
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,879
you said that they are the biases and

850
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,400
what after

851
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,079
i was wondering whether you have

852
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,320
personal anxieties or fears when it

853
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,760
comes to using contracts

854
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,599
i had i had very big fear about it but

855
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,680
after i visited as i showed on the

856
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,839
photos at walido at university and

857
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,960
tested and tested all of these they have

858
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,480
a lot of quantum random number

859
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,480
generators i tried a lot of time to make

860
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,160
it in georgia but

861
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,560
still lack of the finances for now i

862
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,079
didn't succeed

863
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,119
i couldn't check all this in georgia but

864
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,040
in spain i had the opportunity to check

865
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,359
out all of this and

866
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,160
and i see that it really works and also

867
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,839
the certification method is very

868
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,560
important because always we're missed so

869
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,200
because always when usually quantic

870
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,880
sense the quantum random number

871
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,040
generation they have also the software

872
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,359
with certification method so it's also

873
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,800
very important to

874
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,960
get the real random numbers

875
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,800
yeah and i guess it's also very

876
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
important for the people who devised the

877
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,040
theoretical algorithms algorithms to

878
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,280
also inform the board that will later

879
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,640
certify them of

880
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,680
yeah

881
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,880
thank you very much for your

882
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,280
presentation it really feels like we

883
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,599
looked ahead into the future

884
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,440
both into what we have to look forward

885
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,520
to with great enthusiasm and into some

886
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,280
of the hurdles that we will encounter

887
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,359
along the way so thank you very much

888
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,599
thank you thank you it's my pleasure

889
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,200
it's my pleasure always my pleasure to

890
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,480
talk at this camp it's the best

891
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,440
okay thank you
