00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,160
now that uh radu has shared with us his

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,560
personal experience and his research as

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,440
well

so today we're going to have a joint

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,360
presentation from christian who you

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,359
heard earlier in the opening of death

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,640
camp 2021 and andre bozano another long

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,600
time community member as well

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,840
they are going to talk about one of the

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,119
things that dekenes has developed they

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,880
can add this part of the orange fab

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,320
accelerator

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,559
they've presented in the past at dev

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,559
camp and they're always kind of eager to

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,800
share what they're building so that

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,160
others can learn from them so that

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,399
others can use their tech and advance

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,640
their own journeys as well

so today we are going to speak about

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,040
deceptive operations and honey nets

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,400
design

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
uh and here uh i will be supported by uh

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,759
by andre bozano which is the ceo and

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,079
founder of the kenneth as you mentioned

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,040
chandra

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,079
a part of our orange fab accelerator

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,360
that

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,720
we

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,720
we introduced on romania market in 2007

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
and through which we are collaborating

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,119
with several other security startups

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,560
that you will probably see in the

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
tomorrow panels

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,399
so deceptive operations and honey net

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,520
design

53
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,479
why is this topic so important not to

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,399
forget that

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,119
i will also mention that

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,880
jointly with the kns orange business

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,960
services is supporting

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
the

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,119
deceptive ops challenge part of the

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,038
hacking village

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:09,919
so

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,360
in the introduction today early on i

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,599
mentioned about the business internet

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
security report

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
supported by coming from orange business

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,440
services

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,000
this is the fourth edition

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,879
each year in dev camp event we are

69
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,080
coming and we are disclosing information

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
from the previous year but also we are

71
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,239
also making some predictions for the

72
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,440
next year

73
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
this year we are doing the same

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
uh here you just have a snapshot from

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,400
the report which i'm inviting you to to

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,680
download from from our website

77
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,879
threadmap.eu or threadmap.row or you can

78
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,879
directly uh receiving if you are

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,519
entering in the orange booth

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,879
in the dev camp virtual street scene

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,360
some snapshots from the 2021 highlights

82
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
as you can see around somewhere again

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,360
had its big comeback and unfortunately

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,159
it's affecting a lot of businesses small

85
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,280
but also large businesses

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
we saw before in the presentation before

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,400
the fishing which is still

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
one of the principal vectors for uh

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,000
compromising uh and uh one of the let's

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,879
say

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,480
the compromise for most of the type of

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
the threats

93
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,560
uh but also those and especially uh

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,080
targeting uh uh iot uh iot devices so

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,640
these are just snapshots please go

96
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,040
download the reports and go through it

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,879
and also you'll see the predictions for

98
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,879
2022.

99
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,200
in the same report uh

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,040
you will see this kind of information uh

101
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
coming from our

102
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,080
local market

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,720
informations uh which are referring to

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,400
the period starting from q4 2020

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
until the end of q3 2021

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,720
this is the business internet security

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,959
uh platform and services the managed

108
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,040
services that orange business services

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,840
is uh

110
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,639
offering since a while to our customers

111
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,399
in romania

112
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,199
and

113
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,440
this is available for medium and but

114
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,880
also for large companies and it analyzes

115
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,080
more than 8 million security threats

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,360
each month

117
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
uh and

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,040
this is coming all these threads are

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
coming from our customers infrastructure

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,160
we practically gather and we are we are

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
gathering uh we are anonymizing uh this

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,199
relevant data from different industries

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,680
and different verticals uh

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,520
maybe some of the most representative

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,840
are coming from the transportation from

126
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,840
energy but also public services retail

127
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
and here you see the

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
the split on threads by business

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,479
vertical

130
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,479
uh in this period particularly in this

131
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,440
period

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
with the retail

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,919
being the most affected

134
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,600
comparing with the last year with the

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,080
previous report where we had the

136
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,720
transportation as the most affected

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,639
business vertical

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,440
if you are speaking about regions so the

139
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
split per regions

140
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,759
moldova is the most affected and here we

141
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,720
have uh also the the split between the

142
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
cities and uh

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,960
normally bucharest as size is the most

144
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,080
affected but then it's uh uh

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,039
it's becoming ash and also timisoara

146
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
also in terms of the treats by the

147
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,600
distribution by by type

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,840
so ransomware fishing

149
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,600
botsnet ddos and others so these are the

150
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,160
information that we are generating from

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,479
our customer infrastructure in an

152
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,840
anonymized way it's uh very helpful

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
for understanding the impact on the

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
different verticals

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,560
and how can we protect why we should

156
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,840
protect uh and

157
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,360
um of course that part of our

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,039
infrastructure so the generate the

159
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,639
infrastructure which is generating this

160
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,280
information here we are speaking about

161
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,919
next generation firewalls web and email

162
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,080
security gateways ddos mitigation

163
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,840
systems intrusion detection intrusion

164
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
prevention systems but also we are

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,639
correlating several uh security audits

166
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,160
which we are conduct conducting for

167
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
different customers

168
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,120
and uh this then or the information also

169
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,479
uh i also used uh coming from uh from

170
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,479
our uh infra ai

171
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,800
uh big data analytics tool developed

172
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,880
in-house and also uh where we are

173
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,479
collaborating with another cyber

174
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,120
security startup uh that will join uh

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
tomorrow panels

176
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,479
and we do hope that this kind of

177
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,720
information to uh

178
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,639
at least to uh

179
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,880
you know uh determine uh

180
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,360
our partners our customers in romania

181
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,599
maybe to think about protecting

182
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,080
themselves and at least to go and to

183
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,639
discuss with the cyber security experts

184
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,120
so we have a big community here so i

185
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,599
know also we're trying here to raise the

186
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,560
flag

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,160
and also it's the the need to have a

188
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,960
valuable threat intel information in

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,039
order to protect

190
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,960
specifically this kind of business

191
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,120
verticals and sectors

192
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
and

193
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,039
not

194
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,360
especially that in terms of the

195
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
landscape the

196
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,680
new technologies and here i will refer

197
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
particularly to the technologies we are

198
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,080
we are very familiar such as utilization

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
such as the 5g which we know that we are

200
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
commercially operating in romania since

201
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,840
2019 so the continuously changing threat

202
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,000
landscape of new technologies which are

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,919
bringing new vulnerabilities

204
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,639
uh new threat actors and new threats uh

205
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,000
this is practical these are the

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,639
ingredients for for us to

207
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,520
to come with uh additional value to come

208
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,080
with additional partners with solutions

209
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,599
that uh that can can be relevant for for

210
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,520
our our customers from the different

211
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,639
verticals

212
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,759
and

213
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,800
here

214
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
the kenneth solution which is

215
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,039
represented today by andre it's a

216
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,680
perfect match for uh for us

217
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,560
and you will see the the the

218
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,039
presentation of andre how

219
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,919
can this solution help in uh

220
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,440
in maybe identifying and protecting some

221
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,279
of the most valuable assets in the

222
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,120
relevant business sectors

223
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
now i'm coming to the

224
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,719
to the hacking village deceptive ops

225
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,039
challenge that is running since a couple

226
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,599
of days and still have you have time to

227
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,519
to go and to uh compete and maybe to win

228
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,760
the prize the prices which are

229
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,000
in the in the game just couple of

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,240
information that you can also check on

231
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
the hacking village

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,720
section in the deceptive ops part the

233
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
goal of the competition to identify the

234
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,279
real services get the flags identify the

235
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,800
honeypots and

236
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,959
the station deceptions

237
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,680
and for sure that uh you also have a

238
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,839
rule of engagement that uh

239
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,040
it's a normal approach in all the um

240
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
and all the challenges uh we know that

241
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,279
there are 12 challenges now in hiking

242
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,839
village so do not uh

243
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,480
go with those uh attacks no sabotage or

244
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,720
other players so on

245
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,279
and uh at the end maybe you have the

246
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,000
chance to be the winner of uh some of

247
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
the prizes which we will gently with

248
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
with our colleague from the they've come

249
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
and the kenneth will allocate and the

250
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,320
price will be awarded to the first

251
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
player uh

252
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,360
to steal all the flags on the best uh or

253
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,680
the the best ranked player at the end of

254
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,440
the the competition

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
but also we have uh we have another

256
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
price for the best um write-up

257
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,560
to be presented to at the end

258
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,160
uh that's describe each service and uh

259
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,680
if it's a honeypot

260
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,120
uh or not and the meter the methods used

261
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,519
to to classify the honeypot why because

262
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,399
this will help us actually to better uh

263
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,399
understand and will help also uh our

264
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,839
partner the kns

265
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
to fine-tune the the solutions uh and

266
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,000
to increase the the outcome i will

267
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
kindly invite andre andre bozano to

268
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
uh take the floor and to continue in the

269
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
presentation thank you

270
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
okay so basically

271
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,399
um all the information about

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,600
about threats and uh threat actors that

273
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,240
might help mitigate harmful events in

274
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,160
cyberspace

275
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,120
is what is called the cyber threat

276
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,399
intelligence

277
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,440
uh basically it gives a lot of insight

278
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,640
into how threat actors operate what uh

279
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
tool set they are using

280
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,000
what method the they are using and uh

281
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,120
all this information is uh very relevant

282
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,320
for a cyber security team in order to

283
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,600
better understand how

284
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
their network footprint is is exposed to

285
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,320
some

286
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,279
some

287
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,839
cyber attacks

288
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,640
um there are a lot of sources that could

289
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,920
provide the

290
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,120
valuable cyber threat intelligence

291
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,680
informations such as open source

292
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,839
intelligence social media intelligence

293
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,760
human intelligence technical

294
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,519
intelligence and the intelligence

295
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,120
gathered from the deep and dark web

296
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,880
all these sources as you can imagine

297
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,240
give a plethora of information

298
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,279
that needs to be categorized needs to be

299
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,519
analyzed and

300
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,560
therefore um needs a lot of

301
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,680
a lot of work from from the analyst side

302
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,920
um but in the end um the the result of

303
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,880
this work is a better

304
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,560
understanding of the

305
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,959
cybersecurity climate

306
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,519
relevant to the

307
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,360
cyber

308
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,399
internet space occupied by the

309
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,440
by the

310
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,560
network

311
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,519
that

312
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,040
you are trying to to protect

313
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
there are two types of

314
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,600
cyber threat intelligence it is uh

315
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
operational threat intelligence and the

316
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,639
strategic threat intelligence

317
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,760
we will

318
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,360
now

319
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,959
get to

320
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,519
the details and the difference between

321
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,639
each uh

322
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,720
and the other

323
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
operational threat intelligence is

324
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,399
actual uh technical technical data

325
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,760
um it

326
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,720
contains uh information about ongoing

327
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,200
cyberattacks

328
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
or events and campaigns for instance if

329
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,240
you hear that uh

330
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,800
some somewhere there is an ammo ted

331
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,959
campaign that is cyber threat

332
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,000
intelligence uh you can gather iocs

333
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
indicators of compromise and

334
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,399
measure in your own network if that

335
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,680
that type of

336
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,839
activity is uh also affecting you um

337
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,000
operational cyber threat intelligence

338
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,839
gives specialized insights helping

339
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,399
understand the nature the intent and the

340
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,720
timing of specific attacks

341
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,519
as you know there are attackers who

342
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,279
are

343
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,399
very

344
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,639
um so to say

345
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,959
picky about their their target

346
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,680
they are in it for the for the volume uh

347
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
but uh on the other hand there are

348
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
hackers and attackers that are

349
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,040
very specific when selecting their

350
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,000
target

351
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,519
and

352
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,880
they need to

353
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
um

354
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
they need to

355
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
understand their targets so good that

356
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,480
they they spend even months

357
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,519
in order to to get the the best view

358
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,160
regarding their their target

359
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,360
both of these types of transactors can

360
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,959
be addressed

361
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
by different levels of

362
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
cyber threat cyber threat intelligence

363
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,680
basically

364
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
operational threat intelligence can be

365
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
summed up as

366
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,160
a sum of indicators of compromise which

367
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,279
are ip addresses malicious domains

368
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,199
hashes

369
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,480
yara rules

370
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
etc you name it

371
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
and um it's based mostly on threat

372
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,440
intelligence fees

373
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
threat intelligence fees which uh could

374
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,800
be

375
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,000
public uh could be private or

376
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,199
could be

377
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,000
gathered internally

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,120
uh

379
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
on the other hand we have strategic

380
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
threat intelligence which gives an uh

381
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,360
wide overview of organizations or state

382
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,839
um level of security and

383
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,079
how um

384
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,199
how exposed it is um to

385
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,160
to different uh attackers and uh

386
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,639
how appealing it is to different uh

387
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,279
different threat actors uh strategic

388
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,959
threat intelligence

389
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,800
um is not that technical is more

390
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
analytical

391
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,519
it uh evaluates and tests adversary

392
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,760
tactics techniques and procedures

393
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,800
against existing security controls

394
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,199
basically you

395
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,680
understand the tech tactics techniques

396
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,680
and procedures used by your threat

397
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,199
actors and try to

398
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,959
apply that

399
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,440
the tool set on your own on your own

400
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,560
network um even through

401
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,639
red team pen tests most of the times

402
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,920
but also there are

403
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,040
different frameworks that can can

404
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,199
provide this in a

405
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,920
in an automated manner to someone to

406
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,199
some extent

407
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,320
and the

408
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,000
strategic threat intelligence can only

409
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,360
be performed by human analysts

410
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,440
so basically the the biggest difference

411
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,680
is that the the operational threat

412
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
intelligence is mostly consumed by uh by

413
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,120
a machine um by a firewall by a next

414
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,720
generation firewall by an ids etc

415
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,880
and the strategic threat intelligence is

416
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,199
consumed by the upper management

417
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,720
therefore

418
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,440
their content is totally different

419
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,759
operational threat intelligence

420
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,600
is formed

421
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,079
mostly by iocs

422
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,959
which can be easily incorporated uh into

423
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,440
into different uh different

424
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
equipment uh and the strategic threat

425
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,800
intelligence uh is um

426
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,160
in the form of of reports which uh given

427
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,839
an insight of the risks um associated

428
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,480
with certain actions uh

429
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
broad patterns in threat tactical

430
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,959
tactics and targets geopolitical events

431
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,880
and trends etc

432
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,000
for instance

433
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,279
uh

434
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,720
if there is um

435
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,400
a social or social event um such as

436
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,520
elections

437
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,839
uh you can see that

438
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,079
there is an increased

439
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,919
activity on certain certain

440
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,039
targets

441
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,079
um people try to

442
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,199
get more informations and try to

443
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
understand how they could attack the

444
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,600
voting system for instance or

445
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
you can you can name it so basically

446
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,840
strategic set intelligence

447
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,360
um had to map out events in the in the

448
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,080
real life to events in

449
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,880
in

450
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,280
cyberspace giving you a better

451
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,400
understanding of what the motives of of

452
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
the attackers

453
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,919
might be

454
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,480
so to to have a

455
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,440
very good understanding of of the cyber

456
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,559
security climate of your organization or

457
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,960
your country or et cetera or your

458
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,760
economic sector you need to firstly have

459
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,799
a very good um operational threat

460
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,600
intelligence feed then that is of course

461
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,720
analyzed and processed by a very good

462
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,400
cyber security operations team

463
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
the quality of

464
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,440
threat intelligence feed

465
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,120
is given by you by a few indicators

466
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,880
there are a lot of

467
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
that intelligence providers

468
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,360
in the world today but uh most of them

469
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,280
do nothing else but aggregate

470
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,520
open open source

471
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,080
certain intelligence feeds

472
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,960
or

473
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,720
private

474
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,280
third-party threat intelligence feeds

475
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,120
and give it out to to their customers

476
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,919
therefore it is very important to to

477
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,520
understand the the indicators that

478
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,120
mark the the quality of a threatened of

479
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,600
a certain threat intelligence

480
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,840
feed

481
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,640
so

482
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,320
one of the the most important indicators

483
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,120
is

484
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,360
given by the data sources

485
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,880
where the data is collected from

486
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,640
it is important to to have the data

487
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,120
collected in your geopolitical

488
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,480
or um

489
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,640
your industry sector in your

490
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
geopolitical

491
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,039
zone so to say um

492
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,960
because there might be attackers who

493
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,000
are focused on on a certain

494
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,400
area of the world or a certain industry

495
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,160
sector and

496
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,080
they do not care about

497
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,559
about other other sectors or

498
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,080
other

499
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,480
geographical zones

500
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,590
for instance

501
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,760
[Music]

502
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,720
let's say that

503
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,919
[Music]

504
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,120
chinese chinese threat actors

505
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,000
are mostly focused on south southeast

506
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,559
asia and less focused on on europe um

507
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,320
some other trade actors are mostly

508
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,799
focused on the on the

509
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,840
um

510
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,760
um arabic peninsula

511
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,720
uh some others are focused on europe

512
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,840
some others on australia etc

513
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,450
so basically if you gather

514
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,159
[Music]

515
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,640
this type of data from

516
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
areas that are remotely far from from

517
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,640
your location it might not be relevant

518
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,919
to you

519
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,120
and basically you will have a lot of a

520
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,039
lot of

521
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,799
indicators of compromise that um are not

522
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,600
actually applying to your to your

523
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,960
cyberspace

524
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,120
uh thus it is very important to to

525
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,559
understand uh where the the data is is

526
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
collected from in order to to apply to

527
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,480
your to your specific needs

528
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,840
one

529
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,600
one other

530
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,640
important indicator is the percentage of

531
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
unique data

532
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
as i was i was mentioning earlier some

533
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,520
paid feeds are just a collection of uh

534
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,400
data that is uh gathered from from other

535
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,440
feeds

536
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,679
they basic basically

537
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,640
um

538
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,919
aggregate a few open source field feeds

539
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,159
and

540
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,200
generate their own

541
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,520
uh threat intelligence feed but

542
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,760
this strategy intelligence feed

543
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,840
is

544
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,480
not the best quality because um the data

545
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,240
is not is not unique it's a data

546
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,760
that is imported from from other sources

547
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,559
and this data might not be

548
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,760
totally relevant relevant to you

549
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,600
therefore it is very important to to

550
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,400
have a high percentage of unique data

551
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
another important aspect is the

552
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
periodicity of data

553
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,559
how long is the

554
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,640
collected data relevant and uh if if

555
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,600
provides strategy strategic intelligence

556
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,720
on long-term trends for instance

557
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,000
um if a threat actor was using an ip

558
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,799
address or a malicious malicious domain

559
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,760
or

560
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,080
malicious software

561
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,840
years ago

562
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,720
those

563
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,159
iocs those indicators of compromise

564
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,840
may or may not

565
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,919
apply today

566
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,280
so

567
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,159
it

568
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,799
just occupies

569
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,320
space and it occupies

570
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,600
cpu processing power in in your

571
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,280
in your

572
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,080
security security equipment

573
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,200
um

574
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,280
also it is very important to to to

575
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,640
understand how the the collected data

576
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,760
gives an insight into the the trends um

577
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,880
that the the attackers are are using or

578
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,159
they are following

579
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,679
um

580
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,480
uh it's uh it's uh relevant to to

581
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,240
understand how the the data is uh is uh

582
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,880
aggregated and the remaining in the in

583
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,440
the in the threat intelligence feed um

584
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,840
because you do not want to have a very

585
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,679
huge intelligence first intelligence

586
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,200
feed um because this

587
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,320
gives a

588
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,480
a smaller

589
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,520
accuracy in uh detecting

590
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,360
current threats

591
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,520
and

592
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,279
the the last

593
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,159
but

594
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,880
not the least important

595
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,559
indicator

596
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,120
is the measurable outcome um

597
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,600
the measurable outcome means tracking

598
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,080
the correlation date the correlation

599
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,159
rate which is actually the the

600
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,480
percentage of alerts that correspond to

601
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,960
the telemetry in a given time interval

602
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,600
uh in other words basically

603
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,600
uh it uh it means that um

604
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,360
how much of

605
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,080
the threat intelligence

606
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,640
feed the iocs are applying to your

607
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,559
specific

608
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,480
sector to your specific

609
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,679
cyber

610
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,200
cyber

611
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
zone so to say

612
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,679
and

613
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,760
you can imagine that you if you have um

614
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,960
that intelligence feed of 1 million ip

615
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,840
addresses for instance and

616
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,559
every time you only hit like

617
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,360
a few tens of uh of addresses um that

618
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,080
that threat intelligence feed is not uh

619
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,799
is not a very good one because uh most

620
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,799
of it the the huge uh the huge

621
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,200
majority of that the threat intelligence

622
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,720
feed never actually uh triggers any any

623
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,760
alerts

624
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
um

625
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,520
so our approach is uh that we we created

626
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,039
um

627
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,520
a network of low medium and high

628
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,480
interaction honeypot uh in order to

629
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,000
gather threat threat intelligence

630
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,760
informations uh also we created the

631
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,360
network telescope

632
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
the network telescope also called the

633
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,480
the dark net allows us to discover

634
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,320
attack trends and

635
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,159
and it allows us to

636
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,480
set up specific honeypot

637
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,760
basically

638
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,880
a network telescope is uh is a space of

639
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,320
ip addresses which is

640
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,360
not allocated to any devices

641
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,159
thus

642
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,120
it never generates any any traffic uh it

643
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,039
only receives traffic from the from the

644
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,440
internet uh 99 of the internet unwanted

645
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
traffic comes from

646
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,000
from attackers uh be it from uh

647
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,400
automated automated

648
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,200
exploit scanners or um

649
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
simply

650
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,919
different uh different malware that mass

651
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,000
scans the the internet for specific

652
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,240
vulnerabilities

653
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,840
and uh

654
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
usually this

655
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,760
this network telescope um gives us very

656
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,400
good information about what

657
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,679
are the current current attacks what

658
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,559
services are attackers currently

659
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,799
targeting

660
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,080
allowing us to understand

661
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,760
what kind of

662
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,320
honey pot we need to we need to set up

663
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,240
in order to

664
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,600
tailor

665
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,520
our detection mechanisms better for

666
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,880
current

667
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,480
current attacking attacking trend

668
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,760
uh the the the important sorry the

669
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
network telescope is very important to

670
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,840
to create the

671
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,440
the whole honeypot honeypot

672
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,960
network and

673
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,440
also it's very important to

674
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,840
um fine-tune

675
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,080
the the honeypot network in order to to

676
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,320
give better

677
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,919
iocs and

678
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,760
of course better threat intelligence

679
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,080
feeds

680
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,440
the

681
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,679
honeypot networks

682
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,000
emulate with different levels of

683
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,399
interactions from low to to high

684
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,760
interaction

685
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,960
general services such as http or telnet

686
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,679
but

687
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,880
also services specific to energy sector

688
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,399
healthcare finance etc but also popular

689
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,720
iot devices and services

690
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,159
and

691
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,360
of course

692
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,399
indus industrial

693
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,760
control control systems uh which are um

694
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,720
a very

695
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,919
very

696
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,960
interesting uh target for for attackers

697
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,559
nowadays

698
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,840
basically a low interaction

699
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,200
honeypot only emulates a very small part

700
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
of the of the

701
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,799
protocol

702
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,760
the medium interaction honeypot

703
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,919
actually implements the

704
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,960
specific the specific protocol

705
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,240
but not not totally

706
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,520
it just emulates some functionalities uh

707
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,279
therefore low and medium interaction

708
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,000
honeypots are pretty easy to discover by

709
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,279
uh

710
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,520
by by a versed

711
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,000
attacker while high interaction honey

712
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,120
honeypot are actually um

713
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,880
mimicking in the

714
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,120
very small detail um real real computers

715
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,279
real real systems

716
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,399
and real devices for instance

717
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,279
even

718
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,720
mimicking

719
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,960
the the user

720
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,919
on

721
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,640
on a certain on a certain computer most

722
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
movement keyboard movement uh um

723
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,600
documents in the document folder etc so

724
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,320
making it making it look

725
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,799
very very real to to

726
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,600
uh determined and the skilled attacker

727
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
in order to

728
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,640
understand better

729
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,440
how they operate inside inside the a

730
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,600
certain machine of course it is very

731
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,480
risky as sometimes

732
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
there are cases when attackers might

733
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,520
escape from such a honeypot

734
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,320
but

735
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,279
in most of the of the cases there are

736
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,480
different uh tactics that uh mitigate

737
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,200
the the risk of escaping from

738
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,720
from this uh this this type of honeypot

739
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
um

740
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,520
basically

741
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,360
this uh this this approach um

742
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,159
gives us a very

743
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,440
important information as

744
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,559
in knowing what attackers are targeting

745
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,880
what kind of services what kind of

746
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,559
devices uh what are the

747
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,919
newest exploits uh even if they are not

748
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,840
public yet

749
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,960
sometimes

750
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,679
attackers are using zero day exploits

751
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,640
for mass scanning there are these are

752
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,000
rare cases but um

753
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,120
when you see

754
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,039
uh unusual activity

755
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,240
know going to to an um to a port that uh

756
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,760
to a service that

757
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,039
you you know

758
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,159
there are no

759
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:28,799
no

760
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,520
vulnerabilities for that um

761
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,880
you

762
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,000
you become alerted and you create uh

763
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,080
high interaction honeypot uh emulating

764
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,640
that that service in order to understand

765
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,440
better

766
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,760
what is actually what is actually going

767
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,080
on also

768
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,200
you need to

769
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,760
to to understand how attackers are

770
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,720
operating how they are picking up their

771
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,919
targets

772
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,000
how they communicate with the command

773
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,640
and control servers um

774
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
also what tools they are they are using

775
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,480
uh what malware they are using for

776
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,360
second stage attacks what servers what

777
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,279
command and control servers they use for

778
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,480
exfiltration of data and all this all

779
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,880
this information basically gets

780
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,360
aggregated into a threat intelligence

781
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,360
feed which is uh useful to preemptively

782
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,770
uh deter the the attackers from

783
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,039
[Music]

784
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,519
actually harming the

785
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,120
the network and the the

786
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,799
operations uh

787
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,320
of um of the certain um certain economic

788
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,679
operator or target

789
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,840
uh all this type of information is uh

790
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,720
very important in order to protect the

791
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,880
the assets uh and the

792
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,080
limit the

793
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,120
damage

794
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
uh basically

795
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,480
um every operator which

796
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,440
has a footprint in cyberspace needs to

797
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
to

798
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,240
have access to

799
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,120
this type of data in order to

800
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,159
have a better protection and

801
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,640
limit the the impact of a possible

802
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,120
ransomware attack or

803
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,279
database breach or etc

804
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,200
our approach

805
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,960
basically

806
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,320
allows us to

807
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,080
to have a custom tailored threat

808
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,000
intelligence feed for a specific

809
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
economic economic sector

810
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
as i was saying earlier

811
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,480
we have

812
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,559
honeypot that are specific from the for

813
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,200
the healthcare industry we have

814
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,039
honeypots that are specific for the

815
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,720
finance industry

816
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,200
honeypots for there are specific for

817
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,480
automotive industry

818
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,440
energy sector etc

819
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,960
also the the data we we gather is

820
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,919
is located uh in romania for now and uh

821
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,200
this gives a great uh accuracy accuracy

822
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,399
to

823
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,880
and information about uh attackers that

824
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,440
are targeting romania and the

825
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,880
eu geographical space and

826
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
also the

827
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,760
indicators of compromise are not kept

828
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,399
forever they have a lifetime

829
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,880
for instance we we keep the indicators

830
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,440
of compromise for a period of

831
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,840
of two weeks

832
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,760
so if we do not see any any activity in

833
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,120
our honeypot from a certain ioc

834
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,039
um longer than for for two weeks we

835
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,559
we take that ioc from from our feed that

836
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,519
so that only relevant indicators of

837
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,679
compromise are aggregated in the threat

838
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,840
intelligence fee and

839
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,240
there is not very much useless

840
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,519
information

841
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,480
given to to the third party beneficiary

842
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,159
uh also

843
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,000
we have custom tailored high interaction

844
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,559
honeypot that are deployed on on demand

845
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,919
as i was saying earlier

846
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,960
as we see different types of attacks and

847
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,320
the trends

848
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,119
and these these types of honeypots give

849
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,520
a great insight into latest attackers

850
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,440
techniques text tactics and procedures

851
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,199
and

852
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,000
last but not least we have um we have a

853
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,159
system of honey tokens

854
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,520
honey tokens are very useful um

855
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,560
little bytes of information

856
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,520
that

857
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,239
whenever they are accessed they call

858
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,599
home

859
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,079
basically letting you letting you know

860
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,918
letting us know that

861
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,800
a certain resource was

862
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,280
was compromised basically a honey token

863
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,639
can be a microsoft office document that

864
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,760
when it is opened

865
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,800
looks very unsuspicious looks very

866
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,280
banning to to to the attacker

867
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,320
but in reality in the background it

868
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,440
contacts

869
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,200
a server

870
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,480
telling uh

871
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,359
telling the server um

872
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,280
what what ip

873
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,880
was the document open from and

874
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,560
what

875
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,000
what um application was used for for

876
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,240
opening it if it was libreoffice

877
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,320
microsoft office if it was mobile et

878
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,000
cetera

879
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,880
also

880
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,720
honey tokens can't

881
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,160
only be

882
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,839
microsoft offices files they can be

883
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,839
active directory accounts

884
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,960
um

885
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,359
that are very useful to

886
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,000
give information if someone is trying to

887
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,599
use a tool such as mimikats in order to

888
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,119
compromise the

889
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,280
user accounts on a certain on a certain

890
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,480
computer

891
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,079
so if you have

892
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,400
if you see a certain user account being

893
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,000
triggered you know

894
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,640
for sure that

895
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,640
someone compromised that computer and

896
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,280
they are trying to

897
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,440
leverage their access through lateral

898
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,560
movement

899
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,599
um

900
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,800
of course there are a few a few other uh

901
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,640
types of honey tokens such as

902
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
application credentials or database

903
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,800
entries but all of them uh have uh the

904
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,240
the the

905
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,720
most fundamental feature that

906
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,640
they are only accessed by uh by

907
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,400
attackers and um they they call home

908
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,680
every time they are accessed by you by

909
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,119
an unknowing third party

910
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,520
um

911
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,839
basically this was uh

912
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,640
this was uh

913
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,000
[Music]

914
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,760
our presentation

915
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,079
uh thank you thank you very very much

916
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,880
for your attention and uh

917
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,720
please do engage

918
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,560
in the in the challenge

919
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
uh deceptive ops

920
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,079
thank you so much andre christian um

921
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,480
i don't go anywhere just yet i have just

922
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,040
a couple of quick questions for you so

923
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,599
that was uh extremely interesting and i

924
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,440
think there are a lot of

925
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,520
important key takeaways

926
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,839
that people can get from the word that

927
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,560
you're doing but also from your approach

928
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,119
so i was wondering you know what are

929
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:19,920
some

930
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,560
of the skills that someone who has to

931
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,640
manage threat intelligence must have

932
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,480
[Music]

933
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,920
yeah first of all

934
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,520
um

935
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,640
i think

936
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,920
it's uh it's very important to to have a

937
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,880
very keen attention on on details

938
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,680
as

939
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,920
small details can give

940
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,040
a lot of insight into

941
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,000
protectors motifs and how how they

942
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,599
operate

943
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,440
secondly it is very important to

944
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,000
be able to to work

945
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,560
without

946
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,160
the necessity of having a reward because

947
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,359
sometimes you you analyze a lot of a lot

948
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,960
of data from from sensors and

949
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,160
most of that data is is not relevant but

950
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,640
if you keep keep

951
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,920
digging and digging and digging you

952
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,599
you you will find eventually uh an event

953
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,760
that is um

954
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,079
so to say uh

955
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,839
very suspicious

956
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,839
uh and that

957
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,280
basically masks uh other other actions

958
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,599
that are um

959
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,640
um

960
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,520
signaling that uh attackers are uh are

961
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,440
inside inside the network um basically

962
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,320
it's uh it's very important to to be

963
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,680
determined

964
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,400
it's very important to to be able

965
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,440
without

966
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,839
the need to to have immediate rewards

967
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,760
it is very important to understand the

968
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,480
mindset of the attackers

969
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,280
and

970
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,480
also it is very important to have a very

971
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,000
um

972
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,800
high

973
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,079
technical

974
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,359
skill set in order to to be able to to

975
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,480
create and

976
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,880
generate the

977
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,160
honey traps so to say that might lure

978
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
attackers in order to

979
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,280
better understand how how they operate

980
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,800
and also it's very important to have

981
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,280
that technical skill set in order to not

982
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,880
let them know that they are being

983
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,640
observed

984
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,000
i can add here some some points if you

985
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,680
allow me

986
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,560
regarding the skills the skill sets

987
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,119
i can tell you that in romania

988
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,359
there are

989
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,920
universities technical universities in

990
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,240
at least bucharest yash

991
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,520
napoca

992
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,839
constanza

993
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,560
we do hope to to see soon this brush off

994
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,320
also in which

995
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,200
there are masters programs and also part

996
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,920
of the normal years with specific cyber

997
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,839
security uh

998
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,560
information coming not only from the

999
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,640
you know from the university itself but

1000
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,960
from the partners they have uh and the

1001
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,520
partners are normally coming from the

1002
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,560
private sector but also from uh

1003
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,760
from the public sector as uh cyberlinks

1004
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,160
and the third row the directorate the

1005
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,240
new directorates they are involving

1006
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,800
programs in this kind of problems and

1007
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,480
there is another component

1008
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,760
on one with return

1009
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,720
which we are also supporting it's called

1010
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,960
unbreakable unbreakable romania it's a

1011
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,880
contest in which we are inviting you and

1012
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,520
this kind of skills that

1013
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,119
you you may uh obtain uh in order to

1014
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,680
understand the honeypots the honey nets

1015
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,640
and the way they can be built and the uh

1016
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,880
this kind of information can be obtained

1017
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,040
by participating to the

1018
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,280
the uh trainings and to follow the

1019
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,200
challenges in the in the platform the

1020
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,119
cyber edu platform which is the baseline

1021
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,119
platform for running unbreakable

1022
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,560
contests so go in the universities go in

1023
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,240
the masters for cyber securities

1024
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,760
be part of the unbreakable community and

1025
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
maybe you can

1026
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,920
you can be in the position to launch

1027
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
such a nice and interesting solution

1028
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,960
that can be uh used by uh by the actors

1029
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,960
in uh in several verticals

1030
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,359
i think that's very helpful thank you

1031
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,240
both for uh for your detailed answer i

1032
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,560
think that this is very helpful and that

1033
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,359
people should know that perhaps you know

1034
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,599
certain generations how to

1035
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,119
learn everything by themselves uh the

1036
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,640
just the landscape in the community has

1037
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,839
changed so much in recent years there

1038
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,440
actually people had to learn the hard

1039
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
way by building things themselves or by

1040
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,960
figuring out how these things work

1041
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,760
together by by trying to kind of dig up

1042
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,560
information from lots of sources while

1043
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,720
today's let's say younger generations

1044
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,880
have the opportunity to

1045
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,359
just make progress that much faster

1046
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,599
because there's a support system there's

1047
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,520
already so much knowledge out there but

1048
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,680
they do need help and guidance to make

1049
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,599
sure that they use their their time and

1050
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,760
their energy and their resources in a

1051
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,000
way that helps them make that progress

1052
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,680
as fast as they can so they can then

1053
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,839
contribute um to

1054
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,680
the community as well so i think that

1055
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,560
that's a very important point speaking

1056
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,800
of skills and kind of developing

1057
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,200
adjacent skills and know-how to the

1058
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,440
technical know-how i was wondering

1059
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,240
andrei um what are some of these

1060
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,480
abilities and know-how that you

1061
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,839
cultivated by you know being part of the

1062
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,760
dev chem community and by going through

1063
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,319
orange fab because we're trying to look

1064
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,480
at let's say the full spectrum of

1065
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,640
abilities that one needs just like radha

1066
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,160
mentioned you also need the ability to

1067
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,839
communicate the ability to build a

1068
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,800
business so those things kind of work

1069
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,280
together to amplify the technical

1070
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,200
expertise and and to

1071
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,319
figure out how to best apply all of this

1072
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,520
technical know-how to real life business

1073
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,319
use cases that companies can use so what

1074
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,400
are some of those competencies that you

1075
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,319
develop through these um you know

1076
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,839
through the community and through this

1077
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,760
accelerator

1078
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,560
well communication is a key factor every

1079
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,760
time because the communication

1080
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,839
is uh

1081
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,599
important to

1082
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,200
let others know what your ideas are and

1083
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,720
how you see how you see life but also it

1084
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,000
gives you the understanding of

1085
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,160
how others perceive

1086
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,040
you and the and your actions therefore

1087
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,319
having uh real and honest communication

1088
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,200
is is a key factor in um in growing

1089
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,839
yourself in this community there are

1090
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,800
people who are very very skilled uh

1091
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,520
in the in the technical in the technical

1092
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,880
aspect

1093
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,800
but uh they have

1094
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,720
difficulties in communicating

1095
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,160
communicating with others and

1096
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,200
they they have a rather limited growth

1097
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,000
because they are unable to

1098
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,119
work as

1099
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,040
inside the community

1100
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,560
and um

1101
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,720
basically

1102
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,760
when you are alone on the road the road

1103
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,640
finishes much much faster than when you

1104
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,520
travel

1105
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,319
with with a group

1106
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,119
we're

1107
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,040
we're basically moving away from like

1108
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,160
being loners to like working in packs

1109
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,640
like packables i think getting together

1110
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,760
yeah well

1111
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,640
but you can also be a loner while

1112
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,960
working inside the pack

1113
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,119
by by having

1114
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,640
different competition competencies

1115
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,720
different skills different abilities and

1116
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,680
mixing all that together creating a

1117
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,560
melange that

1118
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,680
takes you closer to the to the goal but

1119
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,599
basically to from my opinion

1120
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,240
communication is is the key factor in

1121
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,560
order to to be able to

1122
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,400
to advance

1123
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,319
thanks for that uh well as a

1124
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,800
communication specialist i couldn't

1125
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
agree more obviously

1126
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,200
and it is my pleasure that i'm able to

1127
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,640
contribute to the community and that the

1128
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,880
community has welcomed me even though i

1129
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,480
don't have a technical background so i

1130
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,800
think that you know the fact that def

1131
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,680
camp truly prioritizes getting

1132
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,760
diverse people with diverse backgrounds

1133
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,119
involved is a true testament that they

1134
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,920
walk the talk and we walk the talk as

1135
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,800
members of this community and i i really

1136
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,440
love how i've seen progress you know

1137
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,760
since 2017 since i first attended deaf

1138
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,560
camp and i've been able to uh follow

1139
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,800
your trajectory and many other speakers

1140
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,200
who have like it's their third or fourth

1141
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,359
time present presenting in deaf camp

1142
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,520
it's really really wonderful to see i

1143
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,240
have one last question for you before we

1144
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,880
uh get ready for the panel and introduce

1145
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,839
um

1146
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,040
our other guests so you talked about you

1147
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,240
know being

1148
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,000
a threat intelligence being very

1149
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,920
specific to regions not just industries

1150
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,079
which is obviously true there are

1151
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,319
barrier uh barriers that involve

1152
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,800
language that involve culture and many

1153
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,839
other details so i was wondering

1154
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:31,920
what patterns you've seen changed over

1155
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,599
the last year and a half

1156
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,000
in threat intelligence and the type of

1157
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,280
threats

1158
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,760
that target european companies and

1159
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,800
european individuals uh we all know you

1160
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,160
know there have been

1161
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,480
tons of media articles and blog posts

1162
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,000
and things like that but i was wondering

1163
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
from your particular experience as

1164
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,880
you're building uh the technology to

1165
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,920
help

1166
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,280
focus and help um make these streams of

1167
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,760
threat intelligence actionable in a very

1168
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,440
impactful way

1169
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,400
well

1170
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,560
uh to be very honest

1171
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,280
um i don't think the the trends

1172
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,599
have changed so much for the for the

1173
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,240
past uh 10 or 15 years

1174
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,560
what actually changed is is the

1175
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,000
capability

1176
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,119
to

1177
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,240
detect

1178
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,359
those

1179
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,599
those types of attacks

1180
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,880
and

1181
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,800
have a better

1182
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,440
uh toolset and better understanding of

1183
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,000
the attacks for instance uh in the in

1184
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,480
the past uh two or three years uh there

1185
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,680
has been a plethora of browser exploits

1186
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,079
browser zero days coming from

1187
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,200
mostly from google threat analysts

1188
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,400
group

1189
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,760
you have

1190
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,559
zero days in browsers such as chrome

1191
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,240
safari

1192
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,800
firefox etc

1193
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,760
but this does not mean that attackers

1194
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,640
have recently focused on browsers it

1195
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,240
just means that

1196
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,720
nowadays

1197
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,559
people have

1198
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,800
tools to better understand the these

1199
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,000
these types of

1200
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,359
of attacks um for instance google uh

1201
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,599
google tag google threat analysis group

1202
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,480
has a tool similar to the kenya's

1203
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,839
with the use

1204
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,599
internally to detect zero day zero day

1205
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,720
exploits

1206
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,000
and um basically this is the

1207
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,440
the reason why

1208
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,720
these types of attacks have had been uh

1209
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,440
predominant in the in the past years

1210
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,839
um what i'm trying to say is that

1211
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,280
attacks have had been constantly the

1212
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,520
same more or less in the in the past 10

1213
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,680
or 15 years but the the tool set that

1214
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,280
is available in order to detect them has

1215
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,800
changed and improved over the years

1216
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,200
for example as is the case for for the

1217
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,800
kenya's by using

1218
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,119
machine learning in order to to

1219
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,960
understand that

1220
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,200
the threat that is

1221
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,800
targeting uh

1222
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,800
the the users

1223
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,720
i can i can also add here what i

1224
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,480
mentioned before coming from our

1225
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,040
experience uh monitoring the

1226
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,760
romanian market and also thanks to our

1227
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,760
business internet security manage

1228
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,720
service

1229
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,040
uh the difference so comparing with the

1230
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,079
last uh

1231
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,680
with the last year

1232
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,000
the previous reporting period

1233
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,240
uh there were some changes in the

1234
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,720
overall volumes of the threads detected

1235
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,680
and

1236
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,440
also the changes in the exposed

1237
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,359
verticals the most exposed because for

1238
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,960
us it's very relevant the business

1239
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,599
verticals also for our customers so uh

1240
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:40,400
for

1241
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,680
2020 transportation was the worst

1242
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,559
hit industry in uh in romania uh mostly

1243
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,240
through fishing attacks and crypto

1244
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,720
malware while

1245
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,440
2021

1246
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,240
uh the retail industry uh was the most

1247
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,119
exposed to such such attacks so this

1248
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,920
kind of insights you can have it also by

1249
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,720
browsing through the to the report

1250
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,319

1251
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,319
