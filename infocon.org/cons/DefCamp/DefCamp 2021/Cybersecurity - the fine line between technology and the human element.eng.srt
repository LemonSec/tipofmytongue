1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,760
i hope you enjoyed chloe's talk it's a

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,640
nice segue to what's about to come

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,960
um we'll talk about the human aspects of

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,960
cyber security we have a panel and i'm

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,559
sure it's going to be an interesting

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
panel to watch because we already had

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,119
some heated conversation

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,840
on this topic there are three main

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,400
things that uh we'd like to

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,240
share with you today are humans the

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
weakest link are there strategies we

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,320
could use to raise awareness on cyber

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,880
security related issues and what are

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
some of the things we could do to help

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,800
build a brighter future

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,760
but first i want to ask our panelists to

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,320

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,399
little bit about the things they are

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,559

i'm mainly involved in three major

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,399
projects

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,600
one of them

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
since the previous speaker mentioned it

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,920
is the bug bounty program

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
um i started it in uh

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
december 2015

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,280
and i'm happy to say it was one of the

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
best decisions that the company has ever

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,000
made

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
so yes bug bounty programs rule

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,520
um i'm also managing uh

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,640
vulnerability research um on iot so we

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,120
publish a lot of papers and

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
the talk that i did yesterday was out of

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
that team so just if you check out the

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
beef under labs website you're gonna see

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,560
some of the papers that we've published

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,959
and um

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,400
what else oh yeah and um a pen testing

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,599
team

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,239
um directing that kind of goes berserk

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,360
in the infrastructure hacking stuff

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,760
and it's quite successful at it so yeah

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,518

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,920

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,800
other side of them

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,040
kind of like a blue blue teaming

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,319
background

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,400
i can confirm i work for kaspersky for

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,720
like six years now i've been working for

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
like

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
more than six years and um i'm part of

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,360
the threat intelligence team so uh what

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,280
we're doing is we're doing research on

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
attacks and highly advanced um

84
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
apts

85
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
and

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,959
attacks against like big bang big banks

87
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,599
like financial sector etc

88
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,799
so um

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,440
i'm in the blue team part

90
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,799
hopefully i can provide some insight and

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
i also um

92

unfortunately i wish i could drink with

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,920
all of you

97
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,120
live on the death camp uh

98
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
offline event but hopefully next year

99
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599
we'll meet

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,920
thank you for coming radu would you also

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
like to introduce yourself and tell us

102
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,519
about a little bit about what you do

103
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,680
anymore i'm just a security guy working

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
in this field probably for the last i

105
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,480
don't know

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
16 17 years lost count

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,799
and

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,200
um yeah a little bit of

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,399
red team with a bit of purple team and

110
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,199
focusing a little bit more on the human

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,400
element part of cyber security and

112
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,440
in the end

113
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,680
in my opinion that's where it all starts

114
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,199
so looking for this discussion today

115
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
that's great um around here some people

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
might say that um

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,280
humans are the weakest link

118
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
and i was wondering if we could talk a

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
little bit about this um when are people

120
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,919
the weakest link and and how i know that

121
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,639
there has been some some some arguing

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,160
over this topic

123
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,840
is there anyone who would like to start

124
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,960
can start if you want um

125
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,120
basically i think

126
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
that

127
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,600
throughout our um entire history of

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,780
thousands of and

129
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,400
[Music]

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,280
thousands of years uh humans

131
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,600
i i believe humans are genuinely nice

132
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
but

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,320
unfortunately

134
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,520
uh and actually fortunately for us

135
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,280
that from time to time there are some

136
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,800
people who are trying to

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,520
test the boundaries who are not

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,080
following the like um you know rules

139
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,479
he says like you shouldn't go there like

140
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,000
somebody tries to go there somebody will

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,039
try to go there so because of that

142
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,199
inherently

143
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,680
security um we we could live in a world

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,360
without security but because of

145
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,240
those

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,720
challengers and people who are driving

147
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
us towards like um

148
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,039
a better future

149
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,639
we have people who are testing the

150
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
boundaries so they will always try to

151
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
push the limits so because of that we

152
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,400
need to set up set like some security

153
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,400
practices

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,319
yeah thank you

155
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,600
um

156
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,319
yeah jay what do you think

157
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,280
so uh first of all i think that dan's

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
opinion is very enlightening

159
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,160
if not a little bit philosophical

160
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,919
we don't mind yeah that's why that's

161
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,520
something to start you know

162
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
yeah yeah but it's really cool it's

163
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,639
really cool

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,400
so uh i'm gonna go

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
into philosophy a little bit as well i

166
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,280
think that

167
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440
we sometimes have the arrogance of

168
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,199
forgetting how little we actually know

169
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,520
and with that in mind my argument is

170
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
this

171
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,440
we should not trust even ourselves right

172
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,599
and we are people in security we all

173
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,120
know that right right guys right

174
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
we should not trust ourselves

175
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,319
so

176
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,720
that means that

177
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,520
we need the technology to prevent stuff

178
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,680
that can happen to us you know you

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,199
cannot blame the user

180
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,160
it's

181
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,759
at any level

182
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,919
no matter how skilled or unskilled we

183
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,440
are

184
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,319
uh

185
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
there's a chance that we're gonna have a

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,240
weak moment no matter how trained we are

187
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,280
there's a chance that we're going to

188
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,599
have a moment of weakness even us the

189
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,080
almighty security experts let alone the

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
hr director or the finance director you

191
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,520
know

192
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,800
so

193
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,240
i think that we should proper tool and

194
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,880
the infrastructure to make sure that

195
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,400
we catch the moment when they are

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,160
attacked and we catch the moment when

197
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,479
they are compromised so i definitely

198
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,599
believe that

199
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,360
blaming the user and feeling that the

200
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,759
user is the weakest link

201
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,680
is going to fundamentally create blind

202
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,000
spots in in in in your infrastructure i

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,919
think it's actually damaging to your

204
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,800
security parser to believe

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,840
that

206
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,199
i think that the weakest link for

207
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,280
example in you know in an infrastructure

208
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
one of the weakest links is outdated

209
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
assets

210
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,039
that cannot be phased out

211
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,560
because

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,919
because of business reasons because the

213
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,840
business cannot phase out the updated

214
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,599
assets and you have like five-year-old

215
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,280
code on them

216
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
statistically speaking with

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
organizations that i've worked with that

218
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,360
was definitely their weakest link and

219
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
the lowest hanging fruit when trying to

220
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,879
hack them

221
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,919
so yeah that's my point of view so just

222
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,240
like the customer is always right we

223
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,879
might have something like the user is

224
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,879
always right and we shouldn't

225
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,440
necessarily uh blame them

226
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
well you know that's what you're saying

227
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,719
dr house dr house said everybody lies

228
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,320
you know and you should never trust you

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,719
should never trust the patient when they

230
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,800
describe their symptoms or whatever and

231
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,560
with the same mindset you should never

232
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,320
trust the user

233
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
no matter how much you're gonna train

234
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,760
the hr director no matter how much

235
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,000
you're gonna train those people in

236
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
marketing they're still going to suck at

237
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,399
security

238
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,640
it's it's a given so you have to

239
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,080
constantly run phishing campaigns

240
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
against them for training purposes yes

241
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,839
that's right

242
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,519
but they will click on stupid stuff and

243
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,560
this is why you're going to have a

244
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,440
solution to prevent the moment when they

245
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,760
click on stupid stuff because otherwise

246
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,160
if you rely on them why heavy security

247
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,000
solutions at all in the infrastructure

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,680
let alone the fact that when you have

249
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,399
over 500 or 1000 people the chance of

250
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,080
having 10 percent

251
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
of let's call them uneducated and

252
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
uninspired people it's really really

253
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,200
really high

254
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,959
so you should start and work you should

255
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,480
work under the assumption that at least

256
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,360
10 and i'm being very generous here

257
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,600
of your employees are completely

258
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
security uneducated

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,480
okay i'm going to pass this to tourado

260
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,800
you have a super long and diverse

261
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,399
experience when it comes to cyber

262
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,120
security what are your two cents on on

263
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,680
the stock yeah yeah yeah i really wanted

264
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,279
to say because i had initiated the

265
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,600
feeling that jay was going on saying

266
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
that people are not the weakest link but

267
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,519
then he came back to the idea that they

268
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,040
are somehow that which is linked and

269
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,399
that's what's also my point of view

270
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,920
because yeah definitely we need that we

271
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,079
need technology we need all sorts of

272
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,079
solutions to help us protect what

273
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,079
happens at that moment

274
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,519
but

275
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
in the end it all comes to the person

276
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,839
because if we're looking at all the

277
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,680
security solutions that they are now on

278
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,240
the market and there are plenty of them

279
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
uh they

280
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
protect basically the access to some

281
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
data but if you can get that data

282
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,920
without having even having to access you

283
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
personally

284
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,160
any computer any network any bit of

285
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,920
information directly but you have

286
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,399
someone which you convince him to tell

287
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
you that information you

288
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
in most cases don't need access to the

289
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,640
the system if you need basically that

290
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
person that specific information

291
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,040
and here not to be misunderstood i'm

292
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,600
asking about uh making him reveal the

293
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,959
the password because in that case you

294
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,560
haven't plenty solution to the fan

295
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,360
whatsoever that could still uh protect

296
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,640
this but if you

297
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
really need a particular information

298
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,519
you're gonna

299
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,160
still get it from the person itself

300
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,880
and this reminds me of uh okay it's a

301
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,040
hollywood movie but still some good

302
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,760
insights in there which is called i

303
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,399
think the

304
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,560
or something like that

305
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,399
and um

306
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,040
in in in that movie uh

307
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,560
basically the

308
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,480
wife of a caesar of a bank or something

309
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,320
like that is getting or the whole family

310
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
is getting kidnapped in order to

311
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,160
ask him to give

312
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,920
all the the access and what

313
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,399
um definitely that we should start from

314
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,279
from the human and now to

315
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,720
to bring us some um

316
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,120
can you still hear me

317
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
yeah yeah okay

318
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,639
we can bring out even better than

319
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
previously

320
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,480
all right cool to bring some some uh

321
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
light from my point of view on this

322
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
topic is

323
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,639
we should look a little bit in history

324
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,040
jay and and then we're going on

325
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
philosophical issues i'm going a little

326
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,680
bit back to history and speaking about

327
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,120
history

328
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,920
well uh

329
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,880
the first guy which uh

330
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480
described

331
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,440
what is a cyber system

332
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,920
was uh i don't know not many people know

333
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,519
but there was a romanian guy it was

334
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,839
stefano de blesia which defined it in

335
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,800
the law of feedback which was in 1938 it

336
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
was long before

337
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,079
other guys even started putting

338
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,480
something on paper related to that and

339
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,399
starting from that

340
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,399
initial cyber system that he was

341
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,040
defining the law of feedback it was

342
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
describing that the first cyber system

343
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
that uh exists is the human being with

344
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,399
her his inputs and his outputs his

345
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,480
sensors and his reactions

346
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,279
so look and at this point of view that's

347
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,160
why

348
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
from my point of view i'm looking at

349
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
uh everything that we developed

350
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
now we're doing what we're doing a video

351
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
conference using some

352
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,720
technologies

353
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,600
which

354
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,120
are helping our cyber our own cyber

355
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,360
system to be extended you can hear me

356
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,399
you can see me so your ears and eyes are

357
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,200
are

358
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
extended by this but in the end if i'm

359
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
gonna start talking here you're

360
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,839
gonna hear this okay if someone doesn't

361
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,040
intervene on the way and change the

362
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,279
package and all that but that's why i

363
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
really think that there is a big focus

364
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,959
that needs to be put on on on the human

365
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279
and uh we're looking on

366
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,760
jay was saying also earlier about

367
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
iot and we're speaking about isolated

368
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,240
networks and we have the the famous case

369
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,800
of stuxnet where it was an isolated

370
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,680
network how that usb drive arrived in

371
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,000
there it was definitely a human

372
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,760
so

373
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,720
i'm resource cyber security i'm really

374
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,560
an advocate of the cyber security

375
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
starting from the from the person and

376
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
definitely going afterwards uh using all

377
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,800
the technologies to help him on

378
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,880
achieving that

379
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,199
thank you so much uh let me quickly go

380
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,639
to andre

381
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
what's your take on this

382
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,279
are people the weakest link

383
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,040
when how

384
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,959
where

385
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,279
so um

386
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,660
i think that

387
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,639
[Music]

388
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,720
either approach is

389
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,040
dangerous in itself

390
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
if people aren't the weakest link then

391
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,920
they're devoid of personal

392
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
responsibility which is super dangerous

393
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:34,959
i mean

394
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,279
um

395
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
in the same way um i'm not responsible

396
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,480
for crossing the street and getting hit

397
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
by a car like there there needs to be we

398
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
operate in a world that

399
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,600
has a lot of cyber in it

400
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,279
and in order for us to do that

401
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,560
um

402
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,920
we need to

403
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,959
be aware of at least a bare minimum set

404
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,000
of rules and i have basically

405
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
i'm going to get killed now but i have

406
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,600
two examples i have my mom and my

407
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,959
mother-in-law

408
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,600
and my mom who's like

409
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,959
71 she's super tech savvy

410
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,760
uh

411
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,399
and she's like um

412
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,160
she has her games she has her computer

413
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
she has ray v and whatnot she phones

414
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,760
like hey i received this stupid email

415
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,399
like should i click on it like no don't

416
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
my mother-in-law not so much so i do

417
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,000
most of her stuff

418
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,120
so

419
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,160
i

420
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,000
there needs to be a level of personal

421
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,160
responsibility even in the hr department

422
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,680
even in the financial department uh

423
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
that's that's one point on the other

424
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,480
hand there also needs to be

425
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,680
a comprehensive approach

426
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,970
to risk and um

427
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,399
[Music]

428
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,880
because irrespective of how

429
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,040
well how good of a defense you put in

430
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,320
place

431
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,759
um

432
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,000
and radha's example is stuxnet was great

433
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
some say

434
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,279
that the person that put the thumb drive

435
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,800
into the network and basically

436
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
compromised the internal network was an

437
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,600
asset

438
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
it's not confirmed nobody's going to

439
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
permit for at least the next 40 years

440
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,480
but

441
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
how many of these organizations run on

442
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,480
inside their threat program

443
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,399
um

444
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,920
how many of these organizations

445
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,279
at very high level run a

446
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,079
a

447
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,560
validation program of sorts it's like

448
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,800
how do i know that uh

449
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,320
and i don't know if you know but there

450
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
are some forums on the dark this is

451
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,079
there's like a super weird podcast like

452
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,160
i see radu and uh uh i see dan's icon

453
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,240
where radu's face should be so it's like

454
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,440
super funny

455
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,959
so the powers that we are working

456
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,199
uh but uh jokes aside um

457
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,040
there are uh

458
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,759
instances and there are documented cases

459
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,279
where adversaries on various forums

460
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,199
they offer money to employees to give

461
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,199
them access into the

462
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,400
network

463
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,679
so

464
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,240
how do you defend against that

465
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
those would be like this would be like

466
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,199
let's ponder a little bit

467
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,520
respond personal responsibility

468
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,760
how do we implement an end-to-end

469
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,799
program

470
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,599
and how do we make sure that we cover

471
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,039
all our bases

472
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,839
because the most damaging attacks in the

473
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,720
most damaging intelligence failures

474
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,120
overall not cyber have been inside their

475
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,720
threats

476
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,280
well can i ask you something

477
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,559
i mean

478
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,240
i think that

479
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,640
the way to approach this is exactly by

480
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,400
asking the questions that you just asked

481
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
you know

482
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,919
but the reason you're asking the

483
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
questions that you just asked is because

484
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,160
you don't trust the user because the

485
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,440
user can get compromised

486
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,400
so yes the user can get compromised but

487
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,240
the solution is not always intact

488
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
but the fact that you're asking the

489
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
questions will enhance your security and

490
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,039
reduce the chances of getting

491
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,200
compromised by the users so i think that

492
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,760
you're taking the great steps towards

493
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,440
enhancing the security and reducing the

494
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,600
chances of getting compromised so gigi

495
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
um i would also like to to jump to andra

496
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,440
because she has somewhat high i'm glad

497
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
you could make it she has a somewhat

498
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,840
different background than you guys the

499
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,679
four of you are

500
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,400
mainly security researchers but i would

501
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,360
argue that andra is closer to the user

502
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,039
because she's doing a lot of marketing

503
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,720
and content writing when it comes to

504
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,440
cyber security um what's your take on

505
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,559
this

506
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,480
so hey everyone thank you for having me

507
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,720
and sorry about being late

508
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
um

509
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,480
throughout all of my work so besides i

510
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,200
know that cyber security on the tax side

511
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,440
hates marketing and sales uh and for

512
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,120
good reason too because most of it is

513
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,240
not that good um but there are

514
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,600
you know there are exceptions to the

515
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,160
rule and i hope to bring some of that um

516
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,440
today so there's a lot of um psychology

517
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
and neuropsychology and everything

518
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,240
that's

519
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,400
you know related to marketing because

520
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
what we're all trying to do together is

521
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,679
to kind of

522
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,320
stimulate behavioral change which only

523
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,240
happens when we truly understand what

524
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,520
the context of the user is like whether

525
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,600
they're employees or you know

526
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
people on the internet

527
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
facing all of the things that we're

528
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,880
talking about here not just at dev camp

529
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
but also beyond it

530
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
so to me

531
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,280
the human is the weakest links i think

532
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,039
is one of those stereotypes that we

533
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,799
should stop kind of you know

534
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,039
proliferating we should stop using this

535
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,799
phrase for a simple reason because it

536
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,720
makes people defensive it makes people

537
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,120
feel inadequate it makes them feel

538
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,039
incompetent it makes them feel stupid

539
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,720
and they will never ever be receptive to

540
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,240
a message

541
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
included in any sort of cyber security

542
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,080
training no matter how good fun or

543
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
entertaining it is if you tell them and

544
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
people keep hearing from cyber security

545
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,559
experts that they are the weakest link

546
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,240
they're the most incompetent part of the

547
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,200
system

548
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
they will feel and they will instantly

549
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,400
reject all other messages that follow up

550
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
after this experience so that's why i

551
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,039
believe

552
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,520
a lot in kind of leading with empathy

553
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
and getting people to trust us but

554
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,679
getting people to trust us is a matter

555
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,360
of understanding what they care about

556
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,440
they're not cyber security experts most

557
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,360
likely they will never become not just

558
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,600
experts but maybe even not savvy to the

559
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,640
point where

560
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,880
we would want them to become for their

561
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
own sake and for the sake of the

562
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,360
industry in general so i i don't believe

563
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
that this phrase helps us in any way i

564
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,280
think that there are so many cliches in

565
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,120
cyber security that people just use

566
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,559
because they're

567
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,559
well handy and

568
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,600
you know just uh very kind of close by

569
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,280
but they don't mean anything to the rest

570
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,039
of the people and what i constantly try

571
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,400
to do is is bridge the gap between all

572
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,240
of the great work that people do in

573
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,320
cyber security whether they're technical

574
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
experts or whether they work in design

575
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,400
or their product managers or they're

576
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,799
building companies or teams or whatever

577
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,400
it is that they're doing

578
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
and kind of show people

579
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,440
that

580
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,600
uh you know the ones that are behind the

581
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,280
screens and behind all of these software

582
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,960
solutions really care about them

583
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,720
otherwise it wouldn't do all of this

584
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,120
complex and difficult work but language

585
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,520
matters a lot and how we say these

586
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,039
things to people

587
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,120
matters a lot and it has a bigger

588
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,200
emotional impact than we realize and i

589
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,520
think that the whole conversation around

590
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,320
emotion which is so deeply rooted in our

591
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,320
biology is sometimes too often left out

592
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,480
of cyber security conversations

593
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
especially in terms of training

594
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
because people need to kind of know

595
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,039
you know besides

596
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,799
you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do

597
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,799
that we should get them personally

598
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,039
invested in

599
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,520
training and you know

600
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,120
and like like you mentioned that they

601
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,919
they need to feel a responsibility but

602
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,000
they don't know what that responsibility

603
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,840
looks like if they don't understand like

604
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,159
a bigger larger scale implications of

605
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,320
their work and they if they don't

606
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,840
understand

607
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,720
how

608
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,080
learning a new skill or a new concept

609
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,280
really makes them better for themselves

610
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,440
how it plays into their personal

611
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,480
strengths we need to use cyber security

612
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,960
to elevate their own abilities and make

613
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,120
them feel good about themselves when you

614
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,640
feel good about yourself you're most

615
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,720
likely to learn yourself

616
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,120
uh make an extra effort talk to other

617
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,400
people about it

618
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
pay attention in the long run and not

619
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
just be like one thing that comes across

620
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,799
your radar and then it's gone so there's

621
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,200
a lot in psychology neuropsychology that

622
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,520
can help us bridge this gap but we can

623
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,000
start by changing the our language and

624
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,919
changing the way that we talk about

625
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,840
things because we're all

626
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,400
prone to failure and to mistakes

627
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,559
no matter how good we think we are we

628
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,440
all have blind spots we all have biases

629
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,360
uh and i think that it's important to be

630
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
aware of those and to remember that this

631
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,559
happens to everyone and that we're not

632
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,360
good plumbers we're not good at all of

633
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,880
the jobs ever

634
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,840
while we may be you know faster to learn

635
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,120
so just

636
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,799
cultivating that ability to be

637
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,360
empathetic and to really think you know

638
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
why don't these people care we can we

639
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,120
can start from the simple question why

640
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
don't they care why can't we get through

641
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,159
to them why doesn't you know all of this

642
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,960
effort stick um there's there's a lot to

643
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
get there i know that we can possibly

644
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,360
cover not even like a tiny percentage

645
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,200
but i hope that this comes useful and

646
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,080
that it helps you know kind of um maybe

647
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,480
trigger a line of thinking around these

648
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,360
things

649
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,520
yeah you made some great points and

650
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,919
mentioned a couple of um things that

651
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,480
we're going to try to touch on a little

652
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,000
bit later

653
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,080
one of those is is empathy but based on

654
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
what you said there's something we do at

655
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,559
the radio when we introduce new

656
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,120
information we do it in a way that would

657
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,080
make our listeners feel they are smart

658
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,960
um as you said we don't want the public

659
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,120
to feel that they are not good enough to

660
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,039
understand something or they are not

661
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,200
good enough to to do something i know

662
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,679
that dan has has a comment or or a

663
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,520
question on this

664
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,240
please i just want to um completely

665
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,400
agree with andra and completely agree

666
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,919
with everybody else said before and i

667
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,320
just want to like um share with you a

668
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,799
small um

669
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,080
like a small tactic that we do and um

670
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
some of our listeners here might know

671
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,279
that

672
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,679
with andrada and with alexandra we also

673
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,480
we were doing like a training for for

674
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,320
journalists that happened last week and

675
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,159
it's happening like this week as well

676
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,720
the idea is that whenever um i meet like

677
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,679
or

678
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,679
that's my my tactic whenever i meet uh

679
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,640
some

680
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
new persons

681
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,640
i don't want to tell them that it's you

682
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,120
because of you you are the weakest link

683
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,880
but instead you know we have to

684
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,080
acknowledge the fact that in the past

685
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,640
people were the weakest link

686
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,520
and uh what can we do of course

687
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,480
we can

688
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,799
change this idea we can say like okay

689
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,480
let's get another motor let's get

690
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
another um

691
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,640
let's improve our our our advice and

692
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,720
what can you do to change yourself

693
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,840
instead of

694
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,760
not become the weakest link because that

695
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,840
happened in the past this was this was

696
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,400
in the past let's change that so the

697
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,200
idea is what can you do in order to

698
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
improve yourself

699
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,159
not to become the weakest link and um

700
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,240
i think the first step is

701
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
like our listeners right now

702
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,159
just join deaf camp you know and see

703
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,080
what what other people are

704
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,480
are saying okay then but the question

705
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
here would be why

706
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
should i do it

707
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,440
um

708
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
yes that's a really good question i

709
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
think for for for starters um you need

710
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,760
to like um try to at least improve

711
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,120
yourself um because there are some ways

712
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,600
in somehow somebody will try to trick

713
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
you and i will just mention social

714
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,480
engineering

715
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,279
technology will never be able to like or

716
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,440
maybe we might be

717
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,200
but i'm just saying it's it's a big

718
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,400
challenge and this is going to be the

719
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,480
next topic i think because

720
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,400
we have we have difficulties convincing

721
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
even technical people like developers

722
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,480
to you know to change the way they code

723
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,640
and to fix stuff like fundamental

724
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,559
architectural issues and you have

725
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,400
technical people you know

726
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,720
i think people watching developers are a

727
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,799
special breed of people let's get

728
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,120
serious like them no come on there are a

729
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,760
special breed i think people have to

730
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,640
understand why something is important

731
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,960
and why they should do it and how this

732
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,679
is going to to make them um smarter and

733
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,080
i'm going to go back to andra right now

734
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,840
because i know that you're working on a

735
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
podcast on empathy

736
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
and you're touching on empathy and

737
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,159
compassion um can these be used to raise

738
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,400
awareness when it comes to cybersecurity

739
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,360
um issues can this help build bridges

740
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,520
between experts and the general public

741
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,159
and and maybe also what are some of the

742
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,360
lessons that you've learned so far

743
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,159
yes

744
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,840
by doing this uh this specific

745
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,159
podcast uh thanks for that so this kind

746
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,559
of came as a result of the fact that

747
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,240
i've seen in the past few years

748
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,039
conversations switch around

749
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:43,919
um

750
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,520
mental health in the cyber security

751
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,000
industry into building skills that help

752
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,760
amplify your technical skills whether

753
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,360
it's communication whether it's the

754
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,000
ability to write clearly which is also

755
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,200
byproduct thinking clearly and kind of

756
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,080
what i see you know seniors in in the

757
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,720
industry trying to do after they've seen

758
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
you know all of these repetitive issues

759
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,039
that cyber security keeps dealing with

760
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,120
is try to

761
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,159
kind of build that empathy muscle uh so

762
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,600
they can translate things into

763
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,679
you know simpler and the things that

764
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,600
resonate more with their audiences

765
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,279
whether they're developers whether

766
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,200
they're just you know

767
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,080
bank clients or whatever they are and

768
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,480
there are a couple of things there that

769
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,720
have started to come up as patterns in

770
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,279
their behavior in in what they do like

771
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,799
on a very practical level because i

772
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,039
think that we all know intuitively what

773
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,320
empathy is

774
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
but if you ask people to break it down

775
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,840
and tell you what it looks like and what

776
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,080
it feels like then they have to pause

777
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,320
for a moment and think through like okay

778
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,640
how does this actually work in real life

779
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,840
um and i think that the one thing that

780
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,200
um you know doing kind of working on our

781
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,720
empathetic our ability to be empathetic

782
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,679
uh is that it can help us bridge kind of

783
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,240
the gap between technology and our

784
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,600
biology

785
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
as humans we haven't evolved enough to

786
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,919
be able to deal with

787
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,159
a vast amount of information with

788
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,559
complex information that keeps coming at

789
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,039
us from all angles and try to figure out

790
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,120
what this looks like and what people in

791
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,120
cyber security are very good at is

792
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,840
critical thinking and systems thinking

793
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,399
and that those two abilities help you

794
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,600
cope with complexity think you know

795
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,679
about the consequences and how they

796
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,919
travel through systems and help you put

797
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,159
things together so when you match that

798
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,640
with empathy a couple of things happen

799
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,039
and i've seen that i think that

800
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,440
empathy and cyber security creates range

801
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,360
so it helps you

802
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,480
kind of broaden your view as to how you

803
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,880
can contribute to a community like deaf

804
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,000
camp to

805
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,399
helping journalists like you're doing uh

806
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,720
educate themselves to getting involved

807
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,799
in in some other ways to teaching

808
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,880
students and and getting you know

809
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,600
younger people to pay attention to this

810
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,279
and not just see the internet at their

811
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,039
playing ground but also understand it's

812
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,399
importance for society and uh kind of

813
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,640
elevate their social impact because we

814
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,360
now you know rely on the internet for

815
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,559
social stability uh also on earth and in

816
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,720
space like paul um

817
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,240
you know showed us yesterday in his

818
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,240
presentation i think that it also

819
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,480
helps technical people create real

820
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,559
change in organizations i was just

821
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,399
talking to claire pills yesterday from

822
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,480
the cyber security collective she

823
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,520
actually takes on cio roles temporarily

824
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,760
and then helps um actually you know um

825
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,159
helps uh find and uh recruit other cios

826
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,159
and tells them what the company is like

827
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,000
what the culture is like so they can

828
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,120
step in

829
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,840
and know what they're facing and know

830
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,520
exactly how to make the most of their

831
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,919
experience so there are various ways to

832
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,679
do that um

833
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,399
i've also talked to people who use

834
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,360
examples that are very close to

835
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,240
decision makers context so if you tell

836
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,000
them that you know they won't be able to

837
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,440
get paid

838
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,840
uh over the next two weeks because their

839
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
systems are down then that changes

840
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,640
perspective like a lot if uh you know

841
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,880
you show them real life examples and

842
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,960
unfortunately we have a lot of those

843
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,480
well not real life examples just

844
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,559
examples because real life on the

845
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,720
internet is real life off the internet

846
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,840
as well

847
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,559
if you show them examples of things like

848
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,600
not being able to go you know put guests

849
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,039
in your car to not being able to have uh

850
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,480
all of the stuff that you're used to in

851
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,799
the supermarket so being very real and

852
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,720
giving tangible examples of what um you

853
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,279
know it looks like when cyber security

854
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,000
isn't there or when it doesn't work when

855
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,320
the investment is not enough that gets

856
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,679
people to pay attention and to stop and

857
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,880
consider

858
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,679
what this looks like and what that feels

859
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,519
like because i think that again getting

860
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,279
people to feel the potential

861
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,159
consequences is just as important as or

862
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,640
more important than getting them to kind

863
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,919
of do that mental logical exercise of

864
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,679
going through what could happen and as

865
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,080
humans we're not good at dealing with

866
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,360
abstract information that's not visible

867
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,799
and that's in the future we're just not

868
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,279
good at that we haven't evolved enough

869
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,799
to get good at that

870
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,200
speaking about real life examples maybe

871
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,960
andrei could tell us a little bit about

872
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,000
the strategies um he uses to raise

873
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,440
awareness when he talks to both his mom

874
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,600
and his mother-in-law

875
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,480
is there anything that could convince

876
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,519
them to um increase the the level of

877
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,360
security

878
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,600
so um i think that um

879
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,919
as i've said i mean i'm i'm of the

880
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,240
opinion that um

881
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,760
you cannot

882
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,279
get to a point where you say if i throw

883
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,080
enough technology to solve my problem uh

884
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,679
i mean kevin meetings said something

885
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,279
along the lines of the safest computer

886
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,440
is turned offline disassembled and

887
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,039
stored in fort knox or something like

888
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,279
that i don't know

889
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,720
but uh two things one um and i'm gonna

890
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,399
be uh

891
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,360
let's say

892
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,399
taking the baton from andhra um simon

893
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,679
sinek who i deeply admire and i love to

894
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,799
death and i try to lead in his

895
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
principles something that my wife has

896
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,080
taught me

897
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,120
says start with why and i think that

898
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,679
when we try to get these people on board

899
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,080
when we try to convince

900
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,360
uh the

901
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,440
uh

902
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,679
the the general population that does not

903
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,159
do cyber security to report a suspicious

904
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,919
email to not click on everything just

905
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,880
because oh my god uh there's an invoice

906
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,559
what's with him were you supposed to

907
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,399
receive a parcel no but i need to click

908
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,519
it because what if anyhow um

909
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,159
we we don't do a very good job

910
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,559
with articulating the why

911
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,919
um

912
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:08,719
and

913
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,560
like jay's example is very good we

914
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,800
cannot convince developers to change

915
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
their practices and solve structural

916
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,320
problems

917
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,719
um so

918
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,480
that's that's what i what i try to do i

919
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,879
try to use a lot of the analogies like

920
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,239
okay you get out of the house you

921
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,359
uh go to the atm machine you do not have

922
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,079
a lot of cash with you you need to you

923
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,480
put in the card you take money do not

924
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,800
store your pin with your card it's bad

925
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,119
if you do that irrespective of what the

926
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,119
bank does those money this this money

927
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,800
will be gone

928
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,159
um

929
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,000
yes there will be

930
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,399
behavior analysis and all of these ai

931
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,320
and ml and all of these buzzwords and

932
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,239
whatnot but the fact of the matter is

933
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,918
money gets stolen uh

934
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:59,839
organizations that have security at

935
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,880
their core get compromised

936
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,119
and like last year's history is

937
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,480
public domain

938
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,640
so that's what that's what i try to do i

939
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,000
try to use a lot of the energy i spend

940
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,320
a considerable amount of time talking to

941
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,839
c-level people

942
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,280
and what i found out that it helps

943
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,400
is

944
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,000
start with why why do i need to do this

945
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,760
and that and the other

946
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,400
that that would be a good starting point

947
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,200
that's that's the play on their emotions

948
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,599
that's a great point um yeah as you

949
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,920
mentioned um one more thing i wanted to

950
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,720
say apologies sure i think

951
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,800
like a nuance is probably

952
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,119
i think that we're

953
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,200
sort of afraid of this human element

954
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
because it's probably it's not like it's

955
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,760
the weakest link it's probably the weak

956
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,480
the the link that is the most difficult

957
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,640
to secure because like firewall i can

958
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,280
put in rules it's done it's okay uh

959
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,119
convincing ten thousand people to not

960
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,480
click on emails

961
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,280
a much more monumental task

962
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,320
so that would be my my sidebar so yeah

963
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,720
if if we break this down i think there

964
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,160
are two

965
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,200
verticals one would be convincing the

966
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,359
general audience that cyber security is

967
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,040
important and they should do more about

968
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,520
it and the second one would be talking

969
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,079
to c level executives who don't

970
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,079
necessarily have a background in cyber

971
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,839
security and trying to talk to them and

972
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,640
come up with strategies so

973
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,440
that

974
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,960
the security

975
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
of a company

976
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,599
is increased are there strategies people

977
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,000
could use security people could use when

978
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,839
when they talk to um

979
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,520
c-level executives within their

980
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,720
companies

981
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,240
is there anyone who would like to take

982
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,040
this maybe radhu or alex yeah please go

983
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,480
ahead

984
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,480
right so let me lower my hand

985
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,599
in

986
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,760
i'm gonna say the short version and the

987
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,920
slightly longer version the short

988
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,560
version is hacking

989
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,400
hack it all

990
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,079
and then

991
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,599
and i show them

992
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,280
the the damage that could have been done

993
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,880
unfortunately one of the things that

994
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,760
i've noticed is that even if you do hack

995
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,359
them and you present them with the poc

996
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,520
and

997
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,320
you you know find an rc you find a

998
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,160
remote my execution and you get a shell

999
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,720
on a server

1000
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
there's a very good chance that not even

1001
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,599
then will they acknowledge the severity

1002
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,040
of the situation

1003
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,400
so

1004
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,560
just pull the data from the database and

1005
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,520
show them

1006
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
see this is what an attacker could have

1007
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
seen

1008
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
and that's when they realize the

1009
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
severity of the situation and that's

1010
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,079
when they actually start looking more

1011
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,040
into it and taking action so

1012
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,240
the one thing that i've seen that

1013
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,040
actually works with developers as well

1014
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,960
is they will not

1015
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,359
believe the theory they will not embrace

1016
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
the theory or very rarely that's the

1017
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,680
case you know those are happy moments

1018
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,839
when you find a dev or when you find a

1019
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,079
person that embraces that and actually

1020
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,160
you know listens to you and wants to

1021
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
know what you want to tell them

1022
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,839
um

1023
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,839
but in unfortunately in a lot of

1024
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,320
situations you have to actually go the

1025
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,240
the next step and the next and the next

1026
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
actually show them their data and then

1027
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,920
they go oh

1028
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,200
so you see this could have seen by

1029
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,480
somebody else

1030
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,440
oh

1031
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,960
yeah okay we should do something about

1032
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,920
that

1033
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,440
but alex i mean is the society

1034
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,280
ready for something like that i mean

1035
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,760
it's only like a month or two ago

1036
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,400
with that case in in the us where

1037
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,200
uh

1038
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,359
a simple guy just pulled some social

1039
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,839
security numbers

1040
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,880
from uh

1041
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,280
the web page of the human and health

1042
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,119
services from a state and the government

1043
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,079
said lock him up i have instructed the

1044
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,560
d.a to press charges and to lock him up

1045
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,680
for

1046
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,119
a billion years

1047
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,960
so this is an excellent point

1048
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,400
he used html he used view source view

1049
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,920
source i mean

1050
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,320
who here remembers the case of of weave

1051
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,880
andrey audiohammer that crazy guy

1052
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,280
who pulled the same thing from atnt so

1053
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,760
this is an excellent point the society

1054
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,680
should be ready for this and this is why

1055
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,520
we have bounty programs

1056
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
you know

1057
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,400
so the the scope of the b defender back

1058
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,079
bounty program is literally everything

1059
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,920
with the b defender log on it's right

1060
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,440
there and you can go as deep as you want

1061
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,119
you know because that's the way it

1062
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,800
should be

1063
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,560
in my opinion unfortunately as the

1064
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,960
legislature doesn't facilitate that and

1065
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,119
most companies do not have a security

1066
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,359
contact unfortunately and there's no

1067
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,000
vulnerability disclosure program on most

1068
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,480
companies websites i fundamentally

1069
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,000
believe that those companies are less

1070
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,520
secure because people are afraid to find

1071
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,280
vulnerabilities in the infrastructure

1072
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
because the law doesn't allow them to

1073
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,200
for example i would love to try some

1074
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,839
stuff at the airport but i know that i'm

1075
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,680
not allowed to so

1076
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,520
me in my mind i'm thinking there's

1077
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,200
probably a ton of vulnerabilities there

1078
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,359
that i don't know about you know

1079
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,839
or there's

1080
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,079
go ahead i want to say that um

1081
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,720
complimenting you uh the reverse is also

1082
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,119
um true uh the fda guys like or girls um

1083
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,440
working on the website are afraid of

1084
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
people like finding vulnerabilities are

1085
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,640
afraid of like a huge like scandal

1086
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,800
i wouldn't say gdpr because it's in the

1087
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,920
us but

1088
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,760
and then they say oh

1089
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,680
people shouldn't test our services like

1090
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,160
bam lock them up if you do like view

1091
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,680
source

1092
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,000
i always when somebody says that they're

1093
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,240
afraid of me and i always told them you

1094
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,200
know it's better me than somebody else

1095
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,880
you know absolutely

1096
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,839
yeah

1097
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,240
i would go back with with this idea to

1098
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,560
radu because i know that you spend a lot

1099
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,680
of time in brussels and you're closer to

1100
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,480
people who are involved in policy

1101
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,640
do you think that

1102
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
there could be some policy changes when

1103
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,119
it comes to vulnerability disclosure

1104
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,160
that could um help these issues and

1105
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,079
maybe you could also tell us what are

1106
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,839
some of the strategies that you have

1107
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,720
used to to to talk to c-level executives

1108
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,119
okay first of all about policies in my

1109
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,119
opinion the people which do not know to

1110
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,200
do anything else they are doing meetings

1111
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,520
and policies that's a personal opinion

1112
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,280
although i'm spending a lot of time over

1113
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,000
brussels or maybe because i spend a lot

1114
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
of time in brussels i don't know i let

1115
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,400
you choose which one of two

1116
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,480
now um

1117
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,520
speaking about how to approach sea level

1118
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,160
i i would like first to jump a couple of

1119
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,400
steps back to what andra was saying

1120
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,680
earlier

1121
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,640
and um all uh spiced it up a little bit

1122
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,319
the discussion although i see that we

1123
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,160
don't have much time left

1124
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,839
um

1125
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:54,880
i

1126
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,599
really think that empathy is not the way

1127
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,240
and i will say do i um i'm really an

1128
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,599
advocate that

1129
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,200
the idea of

1130
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,839
the human element being the weakest link

1131
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,319
we should still

1132
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,400
consider it very important

1133
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,800
okay communication is definitely the key

1134
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,760
on how you approach towards

1135
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,599
everybody sea level not sea level

1136
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,960
whatever

1137
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,000
but

1138
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,200
um

1139
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,400
empathy is something um

1140
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,440
connected to the prefrontal cortex so to

1141
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,119
the front part of the brain that's where

1142
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,680
we are

1143
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,200
taught from early stages of our life

1144
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
you need to do that you are not allowed

1145
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
to do that you need to do that and all

1146
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,720
that even though like that look at the

1147
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,480
children which are you're being told

1148
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,880
that look you're not allowed to do to

1149
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,800
eat sweets for example

1150
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,280
what does he do the first moment he has

1151
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,480
the the

1152
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,240
possibility to get some sweets without

1153
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,960
him

1154
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
being notified but not just by anybody

1155
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,720
he's going to take the switch what i'm

1156
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,040
meaning is that

1157
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,800
in the early stages

1158
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
there are still some

1159
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,560
uh elements connected from the

1160
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,960
primary brain part which is the oldest

1161
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,680
part of the brain which is the amygdala

1162
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,800
where

1163
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,200
things related to

1164
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,800
survival instincts are more tied to the

1165
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,599
direct actions that we are after some

1166
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,000
time when we have built the

1167
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,920
human fire or as i call it which is the

1168
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,560
prefrontal cortex so a lot of people

1169
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,480
interested in neuroscience here in in

1170
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,319
this panel maybe we should

1171
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,640
change the test yeah i don't know

1172
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,560
i mean

1173
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,280
there is this movement that we're trying

1174
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,990
to uh put in a corner the um

1175
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,240
[Music]

1176
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,960
primal limbic brain part

1177
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,680
and the the part which actually

1178
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,240
captures all the non-verbal of a person

1179
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,839
is not the prefrontal cortex which

1180
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,280
captures it is the

1181
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,440
is the back brain is that

1182
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,319
that's

1183
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,720
that's where the decisions are taking

1184
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,480
they are not taken in front the front in

1185
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,119
front is just the political part the

1186
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,680
policy part as you said earlier we have

1187
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,720
to do this we have to do that but if

1188
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,960
you're getting burned by a flame you're

1189
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,640
gonna remove your hand you're not gonna

1190
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,200
think and then say oh i need to remove

1191
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,400
my hand

1192
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,319
so that's why

1193
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,720
i think the point was rather to to try

1194
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,119
to have a connection with with someone

1195
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,800
before

1196
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,960
you deliver knowledge

1197
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,440
but i think andra could

1198
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,599
explain this a little bit better and i

1199
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,599
do feel that having

1200
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,400
both the tech knowledge and the the

1201
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,560
human aspect of it

1202
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,319
allows you to have

1203
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,119
two things from two worlds and maybe

1204
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,839
have the best of two worlds to to create

1205
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,490
a message that's um

1206
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,040
[Music]

1207
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,000
stronger maybe

1208
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,040
stronger and more persuasive because it

1209
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,200
is absolutely true rather that

1210
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,000
our most primal instincts said in that

1211
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,240
part of the brain and they're automated

1212
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,880
and that before our

1213
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,119
uh you know prefrontal cortex and and

1214
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,000
our uh rational brain kicks in there's a

1215
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,480
lot happening there but one of the

1216
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,079
things that happens in that primal grade

1217
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,640
of ours is the mirroring effect so

1218
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,240
that's one of the things that actually

1219
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,720
plays into empathy that's when we

1220
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,839
mirror the other person's reactions and

1221
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,839
non-verbal behavior like how they're

1222
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,680
sitting when you like someone you just

1223
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,440
look at yourself when you like someone

1224
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,079
and this is also obviously for whoever's

1225
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,400
watching when you like someone you will

1226
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,880
most likely sit and do the same gestures

1227
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,119
as they're doing without realizing it

1228
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,520
without doing it consciously so that's

1229
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,400
one of those automated things i do not

1230
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,680
think that

1231
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,560
the you know separating these things and

1232
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,319
and it's true that we need to appeal to

1233
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,960
that automated brain of ours and to

1234
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,480
teach it basically

1235
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,680
uh new

1236
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,400
pathways in the brain so it can react

1237
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,119
with more caution and react with more

1238
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,359
awareness and that takes time and that's

1239
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,359
not something that comes naturally to

1240
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,240
people

1241
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,839
but if we only kind of come from this

1242
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,640
very let's enforce rules i love rules

1243
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,400
that's why i'm working is every security

1244
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,880
i love rules and structure and uh

1245
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,040
predictability i love that that's part

1246
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,920
of my anxious self that's trying to you

1247
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,160
know have some control over the world we

1248
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,680
live in and i think that many people

1249
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,839
have the same challenge so helping them

1250
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,480
see that cyber security knowledge

1251
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,480
whether it's minimal or more advanced

1252
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,599
gives them

1253
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,400
control over their lives their actions

1254
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,119
and even their own behavior i think that

1255
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,200
that's a really good selling point

1256
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,200
whether they're c-level people or you

1257
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,960
know just regular people working at the

1258
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,280
supermarket or wherever they are and i

1259
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,839
think that the more power people have

1260
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,880
the higher up they are on let's say uh

1261
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,680
you know in a system in a company

1262
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,640
the most the more prone they are to

1263
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,119
thinking that they know everything and

1264
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,480
when you tell them they don't know

1265
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,960
something it will create that organic

1266
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,599
reaction that kind of feeling in their

1267
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,839
stomach that oh i hate this i'm supposed

1268
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,079
to be good at everything this is not

1269
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,640
very elegant of me but i'll have to to

1270
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,200
to end the conversation here because we

1271
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,359
only have five more minutes and i would

1272
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,079
just want to go to the more proactive

1273
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,640
part of things and talk a little bit

1274
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,359
about uh solutions and how things are

1275
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,680
going to change um in the future um

1276
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,160
sometimes when we talk about users we

1277
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,559
also talk about passwords and uh

1278
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,119
recently microsoft gave users the option

1279
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,160
to get rid of passwords um

1280
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,680
could this work is this a way to to make

1281
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,400
everything more streamlined and

1282
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,760
more secure

1283
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,520
then what do you think

1284
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,119
oh wow

1285
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,319
i'll be really fast

1286
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,400
basically i think

1287
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,280
we move from one paradigm to another

1288
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,599
before it was like passwords are secure

1289
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,000
this is how you secure your account now

1290
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,079
we found out that maybe there are better

1291
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,400
ways to protect ourselves

1292
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,680
um

1293
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,839
in the past we said human is that we can

1294
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,640
sling nowadays we are saying

1295
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,720
i don't know blank blank blank insert

1296
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,680
something new it's on something smarter

1297
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,640
so

1298
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,520
in my opinion i think it's um

1299
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
an interesting shift

1300
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,720
personally personally i like passwords

1301
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,119
because i have a password manager so

1302
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,680
it's it's not that hard for me to like

1303
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,280
have like i know 100 200 passwords

1304
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,640
for my mom

1305
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,319
wink wink andre

1306
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,800
is harder because she doesn't use the

1307
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,040
password manager or she says oh i have

1308
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,720
my phone with me where's my personal

1309
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,880
manager yeah

1310
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,440
so i think we are moving from one

1311
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,640
cornerstone to another change is good

1312
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,280
and let's see what your future brings

1313
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,520
we only have time for a few closing

1314
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,520
thoughts um why don't we start with radu

1315
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,760
like a thirty second um

1316
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,480
idea that you want um

1317
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,800
us to see as a as a takeaway from you

1318
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,440
from from this panel

1319
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,760
rainier people from the

1320
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,640
lowest operational level till the

1321
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,480
highest one in c

1322
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,480
x level

1323
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,640
as much as possible as much as off

1324
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,040
thank you so much um andrei

1325
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,640
um there's a a very smart guy his name

1326
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,119
is paul dannon and he has a paradigm

1327
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,839
about the elephant and the rider uh

1328
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,319
highly recommend to give it a look i

1329
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,880
think that uh

1330
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,079
and as as a father of between 10 year

1331
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,880
olds i don't think that forbidding them

1332
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,599
stuff is the way to go rather than

1333
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,400
explaining why it's not a good idea to

1334
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,200
for things to happen i think

1335
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,119
there isn't a silver bullet otherwise

1336
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,640
would be president of the council of

1337
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,079
cyber security of the world and

1338
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,000
everybody would look up to us and with

1339
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,640
the gods and i think that the solution

1340
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,359
lies both in well thought and

1341
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,319
well implemented technology as well as

1342
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,280
in educating people thanks

1343
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,160
okay andra

1344
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,359
i i would like to encourage people who

1345
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,200
are watching who are most likely already

1346
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,040
interested in cyber security are already

1347
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,200
kind of underway and on their path to

1348
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,960
doing several things

1349
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,079
to

1350
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,839
take an interest in

1351
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,720
not to take an interest to maybe explore

1352
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,000
uh two things

1353
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,240
read outside their fields

1354
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,680
especially psychology and

1355
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,680
neuropsychology those are very

1356
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,119
interesting things they're very

1357
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,359
connected to what you're doing already

1358
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,000
and can only amplify what you're working

1359
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,480
your passion and curiosity and the

1360
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,400
second thing is about

1361
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,559
um talking about your experience kind of

1362
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,559
sharing what you learned how you learn

1363
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,800
it how it's going what the challenges

1364
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,480
that you're going through are i think

1365
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,040
that those are very our personal example

1366
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,599
is very valuable and you never know who

1367
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,319
will take an inspiration from it

1368
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,880
for who it will be a trigger for growth

1369
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,480
or improvement or changing their

1370
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,240
perspective and hopefully their actions

1371
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,880
in the long run so um i hope that those

1372
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,880
two things help

1373
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,079
okay alex

1374
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,160
well i think that um

1375
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,200
one

1376
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,800
message that i would want to come up to

1377
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,359
get across is relax

1378
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,240
you got this it's going to be okay

1379
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,400
you're a professional guy

1380
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,480
and then accept the fact that

1381
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,640
you you know a small fraction of what's

1382
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,960
happening in your infrastructure

1383
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,000
you know

1384
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,839
a small fraction of the vulnerabilities

1385
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,839
in your refresh structure and there are

1386
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,680
a few hundred thousand

1387
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,280
hackers out there

1388
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,280
with more experience and more know-how

1389
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,119
than you and your team

1390
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,960
once you've made your peace with that

1391
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,800
and you can be relaxed while thinking

1392
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,839
about that

1393
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,000
then you can start thread hunting and

1394
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,280
identifying the rest of the

1395
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,880
probabilities that you don't know about

1396
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,400
and the rest of the blind spots that you

1397
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,599
have in your infrastructure but do it

1398
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,680
by treating it as something normal it's

1399
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,440
normal to have vulnerabilities it's

1400
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,920
perfectly fine

1401
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,359
and a few closing thoughts from then

1402
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,160
i completely agree to alex and with what

1403
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,160
everybody else said

1404
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,480
that's perfect because um at some point

1405
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,559
i kind of felt that the conversation was

1406
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,000
a little bit heated

1407
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,119
so um as long as everyone agrees at the

1408
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,400
end and uh we provided several uh ways

1409
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,040
to look at this issue um i'm i'm super

1410
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,040
happy thank you so much to all of you

1411
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,760
for for being here today and for trying

1412
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,720
to shed some light on on this issue i

1413
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,960
think we could talk until

1414
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,800
maybe 8 pm about this next year

1415
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,599
we should definitely do that

1416
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,079
thank you so much again and please um

1417
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,760
enjoy your lunch

1418
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,200
track 3 cyber security and neurobiology

1419
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,558
22. we should have that

1420
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,040
