will out of the woods uh in terms of

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,359
tech issues so i get to introduce to you

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,279
our next guest

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,840
uh don smith thank you for joining us

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,039
today don don leads the ctu cyber

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,760
intelligence cell um

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,120
at secure works and you basically lead a

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,680
global team of highly experienced threat

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,920
analysts and you do a bunch of

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,399
fascinating work that gives you the big

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,360
picture view of what's happening in the

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,079
threat space and how we can best respond

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,879
to that so we're excited to hear all

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,160
about that

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,280
don you can go right ahead all right so

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,559
thank you very

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,000
very much for inviting me thank you

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
everyone for for joining um i'm talking

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
to you from scotland we i think share a

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,280
uh a patron saint with romanians and

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,760
andrew so um anyway let's get into the

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,280
into the presentation

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
a couple of years ago i saw this tweet i

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,280
like to think that infosec is a lot of

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,680
turbulence for very little current stay

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,119
away a week and it feels like you've

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,600
completely lost touch stay away the year

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
and it's all the same and actually i

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,520
feel that way a lot to go away for a

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,960
couple of days it's like what happened

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,880
it's all different go away for a year

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
and you're like oh hang on a minute why

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,880
aren't people still using multi-factor

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,200
auth so it's always a bit of a challenge

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,479
understanding what's happening with the

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,960
threat what's important what's not

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
secure works i think hopefully many of

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,240
you be familiar with secureworks we've

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,280
got a big presence in in romania

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
in terms of numbers we do 1400 instant

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,799
response engagements a year we have 4

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
500 clients where we manage the security

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
across their networks

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,680
we

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,159
capture as an example 90

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,920
million artifacts from our botnet

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,479
emulation um and tracking platforms

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,960
every year we process three trillion

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
security events a week on behalf of our

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,759
clients and we have a way back system

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,360
where we can search which is nine

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,840
petabytes so in securities we see a lot

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,280
we've got a lot of stuff but we've got

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
to make sense of it all

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
how do we go about doing that

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,480
well there's a variety of things and one

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,560
of the first things is to just classify

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
uh what a threat actually is what are we

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,599
trying to prevent and understand um

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,520
threat is combination three things

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,599
intent the desire to do something

68
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,599
capability the means with which you can

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,720
do it and also opportunity the fact that

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,440
you have an opportunity presents itself

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,160
to

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
conduct your objectives and we see a

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,760
bunch of different threats you know

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,120
stealing money

75
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
stealing ideas stealing data

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
temporary disruption or perhaps some

77
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
somewhat more permanent disruption

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,720
in this day and age of course um

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
the main focus for

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,640
many of us possibly should be all of us

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
is sophisticated criminal enterprises

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
because these guys

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,200
have focused very hard in the last

84
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,640
decade or more

85
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,280
on maximizing the revenue that they can

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,680
make from a single network intrusion and

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
what do i mean by that well if we go

88
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,640
back

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,400
15 years ago i remember actually

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,239
being in a pub in london with of all

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,080
people using kaspersky and he was saying

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,159
yep the bad guys have discovered they

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,760
can make money out of malware and that's

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
what's going to happen so we saw the

95
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,239
rise of the banking trojans but

96
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
the impact really was to the employee

97
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,560
whose computer got got infected or to an

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,799
individual it wasn't to an enterprise

99
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,319
we then saw

100
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,560
the rise of cryptographic ransomware but

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
it was single host ransomware again with

102
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,040
a very limited impact and a relatively

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,519
limited amount of money to the bad guy

104
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
there was then various different things

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,519
krypto jackie and krypto mining these

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,760
are still pretty much on the present but

107
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
of course we are all now very familiar

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,720
with poster intrusion ransomware where

109
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
the bad guy emulates a sophisticated

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,879
adversary well is a sophisticated

111
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,640
virtually gets onto the network works

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,879
their way around and tries to encrypt

113
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
all the computers in an enterprise in

114
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,400
one go

115
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
then the bad guys realize that hey not

116
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
everyone's paying because some of them

117
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,959
have got good backups uh what what can

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,199
we do to try and persuade people to pay

119
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,440
okay let's steal data first and then we

120
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,519
can hold them to ransom for for name and

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
shame for sure for showing this stuff

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
out so

123
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,479
the way of i look at this is that you

124
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,120
have got businesses that are thinking

125
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
how can i make more dollars from a

126
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,919
compromised computer and when you think

127
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,520
about it that way you see it's perfectly

128
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,639
natural the the common view of um of a

129
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,720
criminal being you know a young kid in a

130
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
hoodie in a darkened room is not the

131
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,160
case here these are sophisticated

132
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,520
criminal actors and we need to be

133
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,520
equally sophisticated defend from them

134
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,520
so this stuff is bad

135
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,040
things go dark when you get hit by a

136
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,960
intrusion ransomware attack

137
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,600
you may not even have any voice over ip

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,199
your phone comes maybe down if you're

139
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,600
using you know some sort of cisco style

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
voiceover ip service you may not be able

141
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,240
to find your instant response plan these

142
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,120
are not fun incidents and sadly in

143
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
secure works we see a lot of them so

144
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,120
this year alone so far year to date our

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,199
instant response teams have responded to

146
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,560
61

147
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,039
post-infusion ransomware incidents where

148
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,000
the where the organization concerned was

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,280
you know

150
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,000
very badly impacted by this stuff

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
in in fact in the last um

152
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,680
four years we've responded to over 256

153
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,199
of these which gives us an insight into

154
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
how these bad guys work i guess if

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
there's good news and i'm not entirely

156
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
sure it's good news if you look at the

157
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
these uh overlapping charts here you can

158
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
see the dates and you can see that this

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
year we're pretty much tracking last

160
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,600
year in terms of number of engagements

161
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,880
at this point

162
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
in time

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
so

164
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
that's good because it's not more than

165
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,039
last year but it's bad because last year

166
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,440
was already bad and in the word chart

167
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,039
word cloud on the right you can see the

168
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,199
ransomware actors that we have responded

169
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,919
to

170
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,919
in these 61 engagements and the size of

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,680
the font is directly proportional to the

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,960
number of times we've seen them so we've

173
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,199
responded to rieval and hades more than

174
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,720
we have um you know walk bit but county

175
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,479
dark side and bash serena equally well

176
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,680
so we've seen quite a lot of this

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,520
badness that's going on

178
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
what conclusions can we draw from that

179
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,479
well um the criminals are after money

180
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,319
they are gonna like criminals do follow

181
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,160
the path of least resistance and they're

182
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,639
predominantly opportunistic we use

183
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,080
active verbs like targeting in the

184
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
security industry all the time but uh um

185
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,759
you know these these bad guys are really

186
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
making the best of the opportunities

187
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,560
presented to them

188
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,919
uh the only thing i'll draw your

189
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,840
attention to here this is the location

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,319
of victims for our instant response team

191
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,639
is the lack of victims in eastern europe

192
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,800
in sorry and russia now we

193
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
um

194
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,599
we don't sell in there but um i think

195
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
across the board you'll you'll start to

196
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,199
see a pattern that russia isn't very

197
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,759
targeted by prostitution ransomware

198
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,840
and in terms of verticals we have a

199
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,720
situation where our data suggests that

200
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,199
manufacturing is actively targeted if

201
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,280
you look at this bar chart here

202
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960
but i don't believe it is this is a

203
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,039
classic correlation versus causation

204
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
thing where

205
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,319
if you're in a manufacturing company and

206
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,160
you stopped making things because of one

207
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
of these attacks you are much more

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,479
likely to seek external help to get back

209
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
operating because you've stopped making

210
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
money you're also much more likely to

211
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,720
want to do a root cause analysis and

212
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
make sure you understand how it happens

213
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,479
so there's selection bias and people who

214
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,880
are prepared to pay

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,960
you know the high prices for

216
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,800
professional instant response services

217
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
which

218
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
gives us that

219
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,919
this i think over estimate of

220
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,000
the targeting of manufacturing

221
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
there's another thing at play here of

222
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,199
course which is that

223
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,039
some other verticals are much more

224
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
subject to compliance regimes which

225
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,879
gives them more investment in security

226
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
and there is really an absence of very

227
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,319
large banks being hit by prostitution

228
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,560
ransomware and that's not coincidence so

229
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
what i'm really trying to say here is

230
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,240
that that these are actors of

231
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,080
opportunity they're vultures they're not

232
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,879
hawks um how are they organized okay

233
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,160
well we've got the guys that write the

234
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
malware you know and they handle the

235
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,599
back end stuff we've got the affiliates

236
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,240
who do actually conducted and they um

237
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
the lateral expansion the accident

238
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,879
objective and doing the actual

239
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,800
ransomware and we've got the initial

240
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,319
access brokers the people who are

241
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,479
actually breaking in and then passing

242
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,479
that on to the affiliates so it's a

243
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,240
little you know little matrix or

244
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
sophisticated criminal enterprise

245
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,000
what's interesting though is when you

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
look at the adverts for affiliates and

247
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
these this advert is from the tail end

248
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,519
of 2020 it predates colonial pipeline

249
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,200
and some of the other ripples in the

250
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,240
pond

251
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,599
um

252
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,959
at that time

253
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,120
the actors advertised for affiliates

254
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
their adverts were a little bit

255
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,519
uh i don't know what

256
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,120
thirsty i don't know if that translates

257
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,399
but they were very keen on hiring

258
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
affiliates they were very keen in terms

259
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,839
of competition in terms of the money

260
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,279
they would give back

261
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,120
which really just um

262
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,480
um there's anything about russia you're

263
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,959
coming but we can ignore that it really

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,040
allows you to join um

265
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
the opinion that uh

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,800
the thing that's stopping more of these

267
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
things happening is not that networks

268
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,040
are well defended sadly it's the lack of

269
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,760
humans able to type on the keyboards

270
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
in the adversary organizations and

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
that's quite a sobering thought for

272
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
anyone who's involved in cyber security

273
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
and network defense you know because

274
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
that that kind of enthusiasm competition

275
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,240
marketing they were doing to try and

276
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
hire affiliates really gave me the

277
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
impression that that was where the

278
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,240
constraint was in their business model

279
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
now of course since cloning the pipeline

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
we've had a little bit of shuffling

281
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
around but the shuffling around really

282
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
is just rebranding so these are bits of

283
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,680
intelligence product from secure works

284
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,920
um where basically we've got three

285
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
groups who have decided to go away and

286
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
come back again as something different

287
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,600
and of course they are doing that

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,040
because what's bad for business what's

289
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
bad for business is the us government

290
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,360
describe use a sanctioned organization

291
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
and it's illegal to pay you money that's

292
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,279
a bad day for a ransomware actor a

293
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,279
business who wants dollars so they had

294
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,440
to go away and rebrand they also did

295
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
take a slightly extended summer vacation

296
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,640
but anyway um that tends to happen you

297
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,160
know they're all in such here wherever

298
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,360
they are

299
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,519
um many of these groups opposite operate

300
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
name and shame schemes and obviously

301
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,600
nobody wants to have their stuff

302
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,519
published to the internet like this this

303
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,320
one was um interesting

304
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,800
you can see the reverse rhb there

305
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
you can stick that into google and it is

306
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,600
indeed january in russian so the bad guy

307
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,200
here whoever opened this excel

308
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
spreadsheet and took the screenshot had

309
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
a computer that was localized in

310
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,600
in in russian language

311
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,480
yeah

312
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,160
no surprise there and there's no sign of

313
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
the slowing down in fact many people

314
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320
ourselves included scrape the name chain

315
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
website to see what's happening took

316
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,800
this screenshot a week or so ago

317
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
slightly felt bad about this because if

318
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,399
you look at the victim in the middle

319
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,240
it's charlie hebdo nobody on earth

320
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
should be attacking charlie hebdo but

321
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
that's a different story it's just a

322
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,399
constant stream of victims

323
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,399
how do they attack three main ways to

324
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,440
get in

325
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,440
um amazing for me rdp is is is actually

326
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,600
the on our statistics this year the most

327
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
common initial infection vector um i

328
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
don't know why people still expose rdp

329
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,240
to the internet in this day and age and

330
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,519
i don't know why they do it with static

331
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,120
credentials but they really should learn

332
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,519
to not do that commodity malware we've

333
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
got the trick bots um the quack quotes

334
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,200
and the ammo tests

335
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
which i'll come to shortly that people

336
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,760
are using as loaders and then finally of

337
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,560
course um scan and exploit and that's

338
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,839
increasingly been the case actually in

339
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,519
the last couple of months where

340
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,320
um

341
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
vulnerable

342
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,959
actually security infrastructure that's

343
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,480
internet facing has been exploited by

344
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
bad guys i think it's locked that um but

345
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,480
don't quote me on that um

346
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,920
we're having another little bit of that

347
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,320
happening about four weeks ago

348
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,560
and as i said emma is back emma tech

349
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,399
came back about a week ago it's pretty

350
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,000
much the same as before some of the

351
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,480
crypto has changed and uh there's a

352
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
couple of new tag depots so despite a

353
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
very effective takedown operation uh i

354
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
think led by the german and the dutch

355
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,560
police

356
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,519
um

357
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,240
uh

358
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,120
have finally decided to resurrect the

359
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,639
the botnet there

360
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,240
interestingly after that take down which

361
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
was obviously aided by the fact that

362
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,519
some top tier infrastructure was within

363
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,360
reach of um european law enforcement

364
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,399
the top-tier quackbot c2 servers all

365
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
move to being in moscow so they're not

366
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,079
in reach which is um a bit painful um

367
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,600
through various different means of

368
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,279
monitoring we also have been able to

369
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,839
identify for a period of time this year

370
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,240
all of the quack victims and um you can

371
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,200
see they're basically in um

372
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,519
in in europe uh

373
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,600
the the sort of more uh

374
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
monetized parts of asia and north

375
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,959
america if you add up all the numbers

376
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,680
very few of them actually in in russia

377
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,120
that might be the ones that are i think

378
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,680
there's only 18 maybe the test is this

379
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,959
is who knows

380
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,480
the ransomware playbook i think everyone

381
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,240
knows how this works you gain access you

382
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,399
consolidate it to get privileges to do

383
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,880
your data exfiltration you did discovery

384
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,160
in the network you work out how you're

385
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
going to deploy your stuff you do you

386
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,480
pick your moment you do some negotiation

387
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,560
it may be multi-phase may involve name

388
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,320
and shame and then finally you either

389
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
get paid out or you abandon it and

390
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
obviously the challenge for people like

391
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
me understanding the threat landscape is

392
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,240
to document that because nobody wants to

393
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
detect ransomware you have to detect

394
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,399
ransomware precursors because if you've

395
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,040
detected the ransomware it's too late

396
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,360
um so we build lots of little graphs

397
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,800
like this which

398
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
is a bit of a jumble and then we can lay

399
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,720
them out like that um

400
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,800
according to our friend attack and we

401
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
can start for precursors and patterns

402
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,720
and precursors so when we see these

403
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,519
patterns of behavior we can say aha we

404
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,440
stop some really bad stuff here so

405
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
that's a nice thing to do

406
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,000
so you get ransomware and uh and it's

407
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,920
all terrible and everything in don's

408
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,600
presentation is saying it's it's super

409
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
bad super hard and all the rest of that

410
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,720
well this is a gestation of

411
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,440
a particular incident um

412
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
last year i've changed a lot of the

413
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,320
details here about

414
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
some they've got rdp open to internet

415
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,440
single factor off for the vpn mimikatz

416
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,040
is used to dump credentials there's

417
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,800
powershell or cobalt strike there's all

418
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
the usual suspects so you know the

419
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,959
advice here is really clear and easy

420
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,120
don't leave rdp exposed to internet

421
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,600
please use multi-factor odds make sure

422
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,199
you can see host enumeration and

423
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,320
password dumping tools being used

424
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,040
be able to execute power shell detect

425
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
cobalt strike everyone's using cobalt

426
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,440
striking later on in the deck as well

427
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,800
and what controls do you have around

428
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,120
privileged users so despite all of the

429
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
sort of doom and gloom the detection

430
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,519
window um it is small but it is real you

431
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,360
can detect the precursors and you can

432
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
stop this stuff from happening in fact

433
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,120
this is a terrible average uh because

434
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
averages are only good when you have

435
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
nicely distributed data and in this case

436
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,639
i know the data and the data is not

437
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,399
nicely distributed we've got some very

438
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
very long dwell times in our data set

439
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
and we've got some extremely short ones

440
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,440
so the mode is probably five to seven

441
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,480
days

442
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
the mean is 21 because of some extra

443
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,720
long dwell times but across those 61

444
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
post intrusion ransomware engagements

445
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,360
this year that we have worked our team

446
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,079
has worked the mean dwell time is 21

447
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,880
days there's time to stop this

448
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,839
um

449
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,519
then we've got um

450
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,000
still cleverness so ransomware groups

451
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,079
drop in tor and using that as a back

452
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,680
connect module you can see the torque

453
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,160
configuration here pointing at 3389

454
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
which is terminal services so using tor

455
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,000
to come into your server then bouncing

456
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,360
onto 3389 on the loopback very clever um

457
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,639
and of course they're obviously using

458
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,639
common tools for the data x fill whether

459
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,279
it's um the mega sync stuff or or our

460
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,320
clone

461
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,199
um

462
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,040
and you know just to reinforce it the

463
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
adversary only wins when he gets money

464
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,279
and we think we've lost when we've got

465
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,279
quite bought on our network and between

466
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,000
those two events that there is that mean

467
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,240
mean dwell time of 20 days where you can

468
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,120
stop

469
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,639
the bad event you can stop them from

470
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,279
winning you haven't lost yet

471
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
of course in the summer

472
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
just on the friday before twilight the

473
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,199
fourth independence day we have the psi

474
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,399
attacks

475
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
interestingly scripted dropped um the

476
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,040
rebel malware checked the date and time

477
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,000
and then slept so that the real malware

478
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,240
was going to be executed at exactly

479
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,399
precisely the same time everywhere it

480
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,120
was dropped and we did a

481
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,199
reasonable number of um

482
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,680
engagements here and in this case the

483
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,720
actor clearly made no efforts to

484
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
go beyond the servers that have the

485
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
kasaya software on it

486
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
you have to ask yourself what was the

487
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,959
intent here was the intent making money

488
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,639
or was the intent something a lot more

489
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,399
subtle which was um actually to

490
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,079
pass a message to the united states on

491
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,399
the friday before their independence day

492
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,839
public holiday

493
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,240
now of course we've got some really um

494
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,120
uh

495
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,680
you know clever criminal actors based in

496
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,000
in russia here's one example maxim

497
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,640
jacobits he's been indicted multiple

498
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,760
times over a decade and these are just

499
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,679
some examples from a separate deck on

500
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,359
the indictments against

501
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,000
against jacobits and his

502
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,599
criminal fraternity and their handles

503
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,119
and all the rest of that

504
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,880
um in fact

505
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,119
you may have to do some clever vpn stuff

506
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,640
but the bbc

507
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,720
uh published this on iplayer at the

508
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,839
weekend which is joe tidy who's

509
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,520
well-known

510
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,480
correspondent from bbc around cyber

511
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,200
security who traveled to moscow to try

512
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
and meet maximum yakibets he ended up

513
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,679
being his father but um it's it's only

514
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,600
23 minutes long it's it's just worth the

515
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
watch if you can get get access to it

516
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,840
anyway the bottom line is the bad guys

517
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,120
are out of reach for traditional law

518
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,480
enforcement the problem's not going to

519
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,120
go away anytime soon

520
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
hostile state actors okay so there's a

521
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,799
bunch of flags here there's the four

522
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,160
common ones and there's two slightly

523
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,600
less common ones so we've got the

524
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
vietnamese indians in here as well as

525
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
china north korea russia and iran and

526
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
why are these six flags up because in

527
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,080
the last 12 months we have responded to

528
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,679
incidents involving actors from these

529
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
six six countries

530
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,000
sunburst solarwinds i think everyone's

531
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,080
familiar with the story here but the

532
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,240
thing i'd like to tease out here about

533
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,559
the sunburst and solarwinds story is the

534
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,840
fact that they had the malicious dll on

535
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
potentially around 18 000 hosts

536
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
depending on you believe there's between

537
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,120
60 and 250 organizations actually

538
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,240
impacted

539
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,559
um and i believe the figure is closer to

540
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,640
the lower and there than than the upper

541
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
bound so you had somewhere less than one

542
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
percent a third of a percent of victims

543
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,600
had following activity the passive dns

544
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,240
gives the same ratio um i'll come to

545
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,679
that in the next slide

546
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,960
um

547
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,880
so there's a lot of us and there's a lot

548
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,559
of learning to be made out to solar

549
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,240
winds but i think a lot of our

550
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
organizations struggle to understand

551
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,120
that that the russian svr are not

552
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
interested in them and they've rapidly

553
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,440
tried them out in fact this is a graph

554
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,240
of passive dns data internally and if

555
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,360
you're not familiar with solarwinds um

556
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
you can find many places publicly

557
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,480
talking about this thing on the right

558
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,720
which is when the initial dns request

559
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
went to the adsvm

560
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,679
cloud

561
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,720
domain

562
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,120
the ip address given as a response was

563
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,360
telling the malware what to do it was

564
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
saying okay go away and don't ever

565
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
contact me again i was saying

566
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
wait you might be interesting or

567
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,160
whatever and using these responses which

568
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,400
of course are captured in passive dns

569
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,880
results you can then um create a picture

570
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
that says okay of all the people who had

571
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
this dll um

572
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,240
what were the what was the ratio of

573
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
responses and you get exactly the same

574
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,559
kind of ratio of responses that um that

575
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,000
i mentioned earlier

576
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,840
still learning

577
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,200
supply chain is an effective route of

578
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
compromise software update services

579
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,960
build systems that was a kind of cool

580
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,760
bit

581
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,799
um

582
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,200
service providers used as a way in cloud

583
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,960
is still understood and technically

584
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,200
opaque and the realization that we live

585
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,280
in a world of extended enterprises and

586
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,760
these are all valid learning points but

587
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
flow turbulence

588
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,159
these are all old learning points target

589
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,720
breach with supply chain in 2013

590
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
we've got um art of the iron liberty

591
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
discoveries that secure works made in

592
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
2014 where companies have been

593
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,039
compromised their software downloads

594
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,480
were being tainted

595
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
build systems i haven't seen that before

596
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,159
but i've been a scenario in a training

597
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,440
i've conducted

598
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,120
service providers well just look at

599
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,400
cloud hopper

600
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,960
um people have been abusing uh tokens

601
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,039
tokens not sessions um

602
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,240
uh for a long time and of course the

603
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,919
analysts have been saying

604
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,799
no organization is independent so yes

605
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,840
learning

606
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,200
but if you were a season when you're

607
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,640
thinking that solarwinds has given you a

608
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,480
whole lot of new problems i don't think

609
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,640
you'd really done your research to

610
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,120
understand the problems you were facing

611
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,960
interesting to highlight the monoculture

612
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,600
of office 365 i'm not saying that's bad

613
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
but it certainly um in fact in some ways

614
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,520
it may have helped here because

615
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
microsoft worked extremely hard and

616
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,679
diligently to help this this

617
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,080
but um imagine here you've got a

618
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,000
situation where the solarwinds server

619
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,240
may have had privileged credentials the

620
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,919
bad guys go in there

621
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,039
they steal the credentials and they gain

622
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,200
access to office 365 and they're never

623
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
in the on-premises environment of an

624
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,440
enterprise at all

625
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,880
and yeah so these are some old

626
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,159
presentations of mine this one's from

627
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,600
2013

628
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
saying hey tokens not sessions worry

629
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
about this stuff um

630
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,960
and we published some stuff saying the

631
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,840
russians were using oauth back in 2017

632
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,320
so this is not new similarly where are

633
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,880
your keys so these are instructions um

634
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
from microsoft about how to export the

635
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,960
private key to the signing saml

636
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,240
assertions which of course is the

637
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,559
identity glue that people use for sas

638
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,799
providers exporting that private key

639
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,320
i've maybe been around too long but

640
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,919
that's pretty scary for

641
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,919
for me and you can see this bulleted

642
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,440
list of things that microsoft have

643
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,320
recommended to secure adfs servers you

644
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
just have to skim through this and ask

645
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,159
yourself my goodness there's some

646
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,520
something that they really want to

647
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
protect that's in there and of course

648
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,480
it's the private key

649
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
back in the day when i was first working

650
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,440
with pkis we had to use these evil scary

651
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,840
hsm things to store private keys so that

652
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,080
they couldn't be stolen and i'm not

653
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,559
suggesting that uh everybody has to do

654
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
that but um

655
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,280
it is

656
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,960
horrible thinking that someone will

657
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,840
steal a private key and then off you go

658
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,000
okay right today

659
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
different story is thanksgiving in the

660
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
united states um so they'll all be

661
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
getting their turkeys in the oven i

662
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,640
don't think they'll be eating them yet

663
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,480
quite yet

664
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,360
and what happened in thanksgiving

665
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
one year ago

666
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,159
what happened thanksgiving one year ago

667
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,600
as a web shell got dropped to one of our

668
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,240
customers and we detected it which is

669
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,720
great and the bad guys

670
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,159
just went straight on and started to

671
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,679
dump the entire contents of active

672
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,559
directory

673
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,559
this does sort of relate to sunburst but

674
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,799
not quite in fireeye's original blog

675
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,520
post they mentioned um a web shell

676
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
called supernova and that's from their

677
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,640
git repository uh microsoft came out um

678
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,960
shortly afterwards and said yeah so we

679
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,039
looked at all the sunburst stuff

680
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,600
and in the very end of that long blog

681
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,919
post they said um

682
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,440
uh there was a discovery of additional

683
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,200
malware that also affected solarwinds

684
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,120
orion that has been determined to be

685
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,200
likely unrelated to this compromise and

686
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,120
used by a different reactor and indeed

687
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,080
it was it was chinese

688
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,440
and

689
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,200
one of the reasons we could say that was

690
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
because the customer of ours

691
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,679
that was impacted on thanksgiving last

692
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,400
year

693
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
had had a previous apt intrusion a few

694
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,919
months earlier

695
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,000
and um

696
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
the handle keyboard activity we saw

697
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
mapped precisely so we could tell it was

698
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
the same actor because the same traits

699
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,960
what they were typing what they were

700
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,360
doing variable names they were using

701
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,720
temporary files all the rest that kind

702
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,640
of good stuff but in the previous

703
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,120
intrusion they had picked up a copy of

704
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,799
red cloak our endpoint agent and they

705
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,120
had deployed it we believe in their own

706
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,200
data center to take a look at it

707
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,240
so here what you can see is a check-in

708
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,440
from an ip address 117.21.187.144

709
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,880
which is one of our endpoint agents

710
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,080
checking in

711
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,880
which was with the license key of our

712
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,960
customer the victim

713
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,679
and it was here in china which is not

714
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,440
where our customer was

715
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
so we did put this in our public blog

716
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,760
post when we spoke about this supernova

717
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,080
activity and really the only person who

718
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,760
picked up on the coolness of this was

719
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,000
malware tech so he said so the russia

720
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,440
hack solar winds in back door during

721
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,799
meanwhile the chinese were using the

722
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,720
vulnerability in iran to drop web shells

723
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,400
on people's networks

724
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,919
i like the part where the attackers

725
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,760
stole the victim's edr tool that's our

726
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,600
red cloak and ran it on their own

727
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,679
infrastructure resulting in secure work

728
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,440
to being able to identify them well we

729
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
like that too i have to say

730
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,200
and then when it got published and i'll

731
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,880
list that kind of good stuff once right

732
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,720
after two intrusions two vulnerabilities

733
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,559
so um fun patch or be punished please

734
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,120
nsa are saying past your stuff we had

735
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,360
the half name attacks we did 39 instant

736
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,039
response engagements against exchange

737
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,080
servers

738
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,159
um our observations here were quite

739
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,279
interesting

740
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,159
47 of that of 47 either clients or

741
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,320
incident response engagements

742
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,520
eight we saw generic command execution

743
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
um ping or whatever

744
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,159
and in four we saw genuine real world

745
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,559
action um hands on keyboard now you

746
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,080
could argue that

747
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,159
in the numbers on the left the delta is

748
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,799
because we stopped it which is very true

749
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,240
um but it was just quite interesting

750
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
that there was only four

751
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,039
where

752
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,440
actions occurred so again

753
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,480
like solar winds we've got um triaging

754
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,799
occurring after

755
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,799
an intrusion has occurred

756
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,799
rather than triaging occurring before

757
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,400
which and what was interesting with

758
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,080
these four is that

759
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,240
all of them all those four had previous

760
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,799
experience of chinese apt actors so you

761
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,919
know you've got this funny thing going

762
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,760
on with the proxy logo and stuff where

763
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,120
um

764
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,760
you have a remote compromise

765
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,679
remote code execution for exchange yet

766
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,120
you blast it around the internet and you

767
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
drop china chopper which anyone can

768
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
detect you know

769
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,360
um

770
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,200
something odd went went on here and of

771
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,760
course the odd thing was that um

772
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,559
uh

773
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,400
the guys in taiwan had

774
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,880
shared the exploit with microsoft and

775
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,039
microsoft had it bundled up in a patch

776
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,559
tuesday release

777
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,880
and the actual exploit was used

778
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,120
apparently was very very similar or if

779
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,279
not identical to the

780
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,440
um to the proof of concept code that was

781
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,960
distributed to

782
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,799
a map partners on february 23rd

783
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,320
so you've got this kind of situation

784
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,360
where

785
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
they knew the door was closing they knew

786
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,600
this remote exploit of

787
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,240
exchange was going away in a few days

788
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,760
time and they just went for it um and

789
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
created a huge amount of noise

790
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,919
and who knows how they got it um i mean

791
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,240
it's unlikely maybe devcor where pop the

792
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,880
original expo author um maybe either

793
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
taiwanese networks i don't know maybe

794
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,559
microsoft i doubt it

795
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,200
um but there's a lot of map partners and

796
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,760
so that's you know an awful lot

797
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
uh and

798
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,919
maybe one of them is popped and they're

799
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,840
located all over the world as well so

800
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,760
just a very interesting experience there

801
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,440
so

802
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,360
also fun things dropped from web shells

803
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,760
recently so using dns tunneling for

804
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
command and control two different

805
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,480
variants same actor um

806
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,240
where in the first one

807
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,159
they're looking for text records so you

808
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,520
can get a multi-line record back and

809
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,080
then they can decode the commands from

810
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,440
from the dns

811
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,200
and the second one is a record so

812
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,039
they've got to do a little loop to

813
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,200
recover multiple a records concatenate

814
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
that and and create their commands so

815
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,760
lots of fun stuff there terms dns

816
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,360
timeline

817
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,039
and obviously with dns handling please

818
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,640
do not ignore detections because the

819
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,600
destination ip is 8.8.8.8. it doesn't

820
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,039
always make it's good because the bad

821
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,279
stuff flows through dns but anyway let's

822
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,640
not go through there and that of course

823
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,480
that was dropping then global strike and

824
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,399
everyone's using cobalt strikes so if

825
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,039
you're a hospital hostile state actor

826
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,480
you really don't want to be discovered

827
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,080
and have the attack attributes your home

828
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,520
nation so you're going to use commodity

829
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,960
tools

830
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,799
i'm going to finish just now with two

831
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,159
very quick stories they're slightly

832
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,080
older stories um hopefully not many of

833
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,520
you have heard them before but i think

834
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
they're fun and they also help us think

835
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,799
a little bit more broadly about the

836
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,320
threats we face

837
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,440
the first one is a fake ngo a fake

838
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,760
non-governmental organization

839
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,880
so qatar were awarded the footballing

840
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
world cup soccer for anyone who's

841
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,640
american listening um

842
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,399
clearly an obvious choice for the

843
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,240
football world cup it's not warm there

844
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,600
at all and they're famous for bullying

845
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,520
nation aren't they so no controversy

846
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,320
there

847
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,120
they then start to build all of these um

848
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,960
stadiums and i actually visited the

849
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,480
people responsible i was in qatar um

850
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,880
meeting with folks there and they said

851
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,559
look we're using the world cup as a

852
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,120
catalyst to become the next to buy um

853
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,960
this gives us the investment makes us a

854
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,200
holiday destination so spending all this

855
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,960
money in the world cup projects

856
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,559
construction projects

857
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,880
with a lot of immigrant labor

858
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,240
and then the washington post puts out

859
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,399
this article saying um

860
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,760
really we're not taking good care of

861
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
these construction workers

862
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
and qatar is outraged

863
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,000
and around the same time this um

864
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,840
ngo appears called um voiceless victims

865
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,960
and

866
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,080
they

867
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
ostensibly they were caring about

868
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,840
children all over the world

869
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,240
um but if you looked really into their

870
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,440
twitter and all the rest of that you

871
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
could see that they had a strong focus

872
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,720
on um things going on in qatar

873
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,159
um

874
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,480
so it's a bit odd and they

875
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
they also had this thing going on where

876
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,399
they were supposed to be based in paris

877
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,240
spain and london

878
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,200
yet

879
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,520
if you did a pattern of pattern of life

880
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,600
analysis on their twitter they weren't

881
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
working on a friday and saturday which

882
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,679
doesn't feel like a western european

883
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,360
working week that feels like a middle

884
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,120
eastern working week to me

885
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,480
and then if you look at the time of day

886
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,880
they're working it also felt very

887
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
um middle eastern too

888
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,559
they also had where they were coming

889
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,640
from when they were sending lures to

890
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,960
this is to one of our customers um so

891
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,039
you're kind of like hmm are these people

892
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,880
who they claim to be

893
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,360
and we worked with tom brewster at

894
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,760
forbes on this um

895
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
i had some others

896
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,679
uh this was the guy overall in charge of

897
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,960
voices victims his name was luke han

898
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,440
he had zero connections on linkedin

899
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,760
yet he'd been working for 15 years

900
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,919
that's got to be some kind of record

901
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,399
and he has a law degree from oxford

902
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,640
he has a law degree from oxford yet

903
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,679
when um he was challenged by tom

904
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,520
brewster the day before his article was

905
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,679
published he replied with this

906
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,279
and i'll read the second sentence as a

907
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,200
second paragraph to you

908
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
we sincerely hope that your information

909
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,559
isn't coming from the same ones who are

910
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,760
trying to bring us down and prevent the

911
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,279
truth about foreign workers situation

912
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,840
and qatar to be told and i just ran out

913
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,519
of oxygen saying that

914
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,919
now i don't have particularly good

915
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,640
english um being scottish of course but

916
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,440
uh

917
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
seriously if you have a law degree from

918
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,519
oxford you're gonna know you need to put

919
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,679
a comma in that sentence that is not

920
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,039
sentence written by someone who has a

921
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,720
law degree from oxford

922
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
anyway um we

923
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,960
published this or tom published this and

924
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,120
on that day their website went from this

925
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,640
to this

926
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,840
fake ngo

927
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,600
gone fake people

928
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,159
this is the curious case of miash

929
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,760
the ash was a catfish run by the

930
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
iranians

931
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,519
cobalt gypsy iranian group desperately

932
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,200
trying to get into one of our customers

933
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,720
in saudi arabia

934
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,640
trying to drop poppy wrap

935
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,360
we stopped that campaign

936
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,200
and then a few weeks later

937
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,120
we were asked to analyze some malware

938
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,720
from the same customer that had come in

939
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,159
through a different room

940
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,320
we analyzed it and it was popular and

941
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,399
how did it get there it got there

942
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,840
because

943
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,880
um

944
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,000
a lady

945
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,799
based in london called me ash apparently

946
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,399
a photographer

947
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,799
um had reached out to a systems

948
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,799
administrator at our customer

949
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,200
and i tried to build up a relationship

950
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,679
with him and he had initially rebutted

951
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,000
this and said i'm not interested go away

952
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,760
whatever but eventually

953
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,679
um you know he started to chat to her

954
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,399
and all the rest of this

955
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,799
many many communications they apparently

956
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,799
both liked traveling and then finally

957
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,679
she sends him an excel spreadsheet on

958
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,159
gmail and says

959
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,399
um this is a questionnaire about places

960
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,120
that you'd like to go and see um but

961
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,559
it'll be better if you open it on your

962
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,919
work computer

963
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,399
and of course he does and it drops

964
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,320
popular at which point

965
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,720
the message is dear mia due to your file

966
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
i'm in trouble now because this fire

967
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,039
file has a virus issue so he was

968
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,120
properly catfished

969
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,360
and there's another victim here and i

970
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,720
know i'm talking to predominantly

971
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
romanian audience that urge everyone to

972
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,440
not try and pursue this lady this is a

973
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,000
romanian photographer she's expressed no

974
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
desire to get involved in this this is a

975
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,840
relatively old story don't try and work

976
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,360
out who she is it's got nothing to do

977
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,120
with her they just stole her photos um

978
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
and they used those photos and we

979
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,640
published this got

980
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,760
quite a lot of press everywhere um

981
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,799
and

982
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,880
a week after went public another victim

983
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,399
reached back out to alice and the

984
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,519
researcher that uncovered all of this

985
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,159
saying that he had been involved and we

986
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,679
then learned a lot more about the

987
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,919
tactics of the iranians posing as this

988
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,559
fake miash persona and they had been

989
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,880
communicating for hundreds of days he

990
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,200
had registered domains he'd given

991
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,519
her her inverted commas from remote

992
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,519
access to his computer and he worked for

993
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,919
a very very large um consulting

994
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,919
organization um

995
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,360
at the time

996
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,159
uh he he said to allison when she was

997
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,360
interviewing him

998
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,760
many times i doubted her intentions but

999
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
i never once doubted that this was a

1000
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,799
real person

1001
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,320
and he thought he was talking to a

1002
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,159
photographer in london and he was

1003
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,159
actually talking to

1004
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,280
a hostile state actor based in iran so

1005
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,679
pure catfish and you know these two

1006
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,000
stories just give an example as to how

1007
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,199
far

1008
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,280
uh organizations will take it if they

1009
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,679
really want something from you my last

1010
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,719
slide i was in iceland i was talking to

1011
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,639
the police in iceland

1012
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,040
and the policeman there said to me

1013
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,119
i will show you a lure

1014
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,199
relating to a romance scam and you will

1015
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,520
not believe that somebody fell for this

1016
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,159
and lost tens of thousands of dollars

1017
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,040
so

1018
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,719
i don't know if you can see my mouse but

1019
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,399
can anybody spot anything slightly dodgy

1020
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,480
or slightly wrong

1021
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,079
with this lure somebody received this

1022
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,399
with a swastika on it

1023
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,280
and still sent money over

1024
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,320
and as the head of the cyber team at the

1025
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,480
icelandic police said to me at the time

1026
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,400
if you get something like that and you

1027
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,079
don't stop

1028
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,760
how entangled have you become in the

1029
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,200
great land

1030
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,960
and that's everything for for me thank

1031
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
you so much don you're perfectly on time

1032
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,400
and this has been just incredibly

1033
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,960
comprehensive i mean

1034
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,800
you've managed to capture so much

1035
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,520
information and and top it all off with

1036
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
some

1037
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,680
like just extremely extremely relevant

1038
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,280
and perhaps um i think new to many

1039
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,720
examples that show um that helped us

1040
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,200
kind of plug that big picture into some

1041
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,599
very real case scenarios and learn how

1042
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,119
to better

1043
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,119
identify the situations but also how to

1044
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,119
better communicate them because there is

1045
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,760
so much research i believe in cyber

1046
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
security right now and so many people

1047
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,079
really struggling their best to get the

1048
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,440
information out there and get it out

1049
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,720
there fast

1050
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,800
so that it may reach whoever needs to

1051
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,359
that i think that many you know people

1052
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,480
working in security or mit can use these

1053
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,280
stories and examples and share them with

1054
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,240
decision makers so that it may help them

1055
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,320
you know translate things better into

1056
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,240
their terms so this has been just

1057
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,000
absolutely mind-blowing

1058
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,440
um

1059
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
i wanted to ask

1060
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,760
when you deal with and i did i think

1061
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,800
that this is a relevant thing for almost

1062
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
everyone working in cyber security when

1063
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,440
you deal with so many there's always a

1064
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,000
fire burning somewhere uh multiple hours

1065
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,240
of months most times there's a lot of

1066
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,800
negativity how do you deal with all of

1067
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,280
that but still protect your mental

1068
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,520
mental health how do you still remain

1069
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,839
positive and constructive when you see

1070
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,160
all of this damage happening all the

1071
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,040
time every day day in and day out

1072
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,560
yeah that's it is difficult but um the

1073
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,880
the thing which i obviously i i kind of

1074
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,240
skimmed over

1075
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,920
in presentations you always talk about

1076
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,520
the the incidents i've occurred that

1077
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,760
have had had the most drama

1078
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,119
but the number of times that we've

1079
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,440
stopped sdb bot because we've got good

1080
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,000
countermeasures for it um and we know

1081
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
that therefore clock wasn't deployed

1082
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,079
there are all sorts of success stories

1083
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,359
they're not as emotive as as as the big

1084
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,960
incidents but the success stories are

1085
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,359
there the frustration is and going back

1086
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,440
to the very first slide

1087
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,480
the solutions here are not to focus on

1088
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,320
shiny blinky things things of the blue

1089
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,119
led it's like it's asset management it's

1090
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,440
patch management it's building your

1091
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,359
defensive controls putting compensating

1092
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,040
controls in if you can't

1093
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,960
it's good identity and access management

1094
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,599
minimizing who starts access to what

1095
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,960
if we're honest none of us in the

1096
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,480
security industry want to do any of

1097
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,880
these really really hard i t like things

1098
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,560
but general health and cleanliness of

1099
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,160
the environment

1100
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,200
means that people will not fall prey to

1101
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,560
this um

1102
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,800
and that it isn't all black when you see

1103
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,880
that the the takeaways here are the same

1104
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,800
takeaways now i was last defending a

1105
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,760
network in 2005 personally

1106
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,160
when i worked at st micro and it's the

1107
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,040
same takeaways now in 2021 as i was

1108
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,000
working off in 2005. it's all got a bit

1109
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,480
messier but it's still the same stuff

1110
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,680
you know so

1111
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,079
i i don't find it too depressing it's

1112
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,720
fun rather than person actually that's a

1113
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,598
different story

1114
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,680
thanks for sharing all of that i think

1115
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,680
that is so useful and there are so much

1116
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,240
like people in the chat uh are saying

1117
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,480
how much they love your presentation

1118
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,280
uh like many of them and they you you

1119
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
really got through to them and you

1120
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,880
really i think helped expand those views

1121
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,800
to uh you know help them connect the

1122
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,960
dots help them see so many other things

1123
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,119
and help them see what their potential

1124
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,119
and hopefully we don't know where we

1125
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,800
have an amazing team in romania so

1126
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
people can reach out to those guys and

1127
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,599
girls yeah take care thank you very much

1128
