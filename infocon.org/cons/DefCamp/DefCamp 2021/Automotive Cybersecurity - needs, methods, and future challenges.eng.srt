1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,839
and since we're on the topic of what the

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,799
future has in hold of us um if we were

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,200
to peer further into it we can see that

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,200
the effort to automate vehicles is here

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,160
to stay

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,160
and not only is it hard to adhere to

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,320
good security practices when executing

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,359
on this automation but doing so also

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,160
pushes for public regulation to keep up

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,080
here we have ian gloss who is

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,000
enthusiastic about following this cat

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,080
and mouse game and he is responsible for

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
developing algorithms for the automotive

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
cyber security products at garrett

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,920
advancing motion

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,680
today he will take us through the

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,000
automotive security challenges both

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,760
those that we have already mapped but

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,920
also those that lie dormant in our near

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,879
future

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,960
ian take the wheel

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,760
hello thank you for a kind uh kind

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,039
introduction

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,520
my name is ian gloss i'm from great

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,039
advancing motion company and i'm the

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,680
algorithm development engineer working

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,559
in automotive cyber security uh this

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,800
presentation will will be

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
quite different from

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,239
previous one because

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,439
this will be quite uh overview of uh

32
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,640
whole automotive cyber security because

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,760
i think it's quite different from from

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,080
classical i.t cyber security or

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,960
classical company cyber security

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,200
and my presentation

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,000
when

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,640
i can switch to next slide there

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,479
my presentation will

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,600
will consist of three main topics uh

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,079
first of them will be motivation needs

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,520
and requirements uh on cyber security in

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
in automotive

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,799
second

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,119
i would like to to introduce our

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,320
solution

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,520
and as a third point uh i will i will

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,159
describe current and future challenges

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
what we can expect and what what are

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,520
current issues there

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,119
so uh first first part motivation needs

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,560
requirements um uh some some brief

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,960
history uh we we can see that there were

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,160
quite a high number of attacks or

55
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,598
incidents

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,800
in terms of cyber security of vehicles

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,760
we are

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,879
concentrated on vehicles not not only

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,959
the infrastructure we are we are

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,840
we are looking at the vehicles mainly

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,959
and you can see that uh most

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,080
known

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,040
oems are involved in this

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,560
this uh these are only few few most

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
known attacks and

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,560
yeah i i will move to the most most

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,239
famous one

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,959
which which was presented by charlie

69
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,599
miller and chris balashek

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,879
and they were able to remotely control

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,120
hold the vehicle they were able to stop

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,879
the engine they were able to to

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,599
push the vehicle from the road and

74
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,480
if you want there is a nice video

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,519
as you can see on the right hand side uh

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,319
the

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,879
the journalist was in the vehicle and

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,840
they they took him from from the from

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,840
the street to the green green part so

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,599
it's quite interesting

81
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,680
and he wasn't able to do anything with

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,319
this so he wasn't able to stop the

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,080
vehicle and zone so

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,720
this is very very

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,920
very

86
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,519
big issue if

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,280
such a thing happens

88
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,720
and yeah it's quite quite an all-in-one

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,000
incident and it was caused by

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,280
by big issues in infrastructure because

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
there were no passwords there were no no

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,200
security and so on so today it's much

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,760
better but these were the first first

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,400
issues which which automotive industry

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,000
was most challenging

96
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,360
so

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,959
about what

98
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,599
every company in automotive needs to

99
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,640
solve

100
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
this is quite

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,080
quite similar to

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,920
any other company

103
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,159
if we are talking about automotive

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,640
companies i mean oems which are big big

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,478
automotive companies which are producing

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,839
the vehicles

107
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,918
and also tire one to n suppliers which

108
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,759
are which are

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
supplying the parts of the vehicle to

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,680
the oem

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
we are call we call them

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
tire one to n because

113
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
there are

114
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,320
uh suppliers of hold systems

115
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,280
and

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,240
then tire two is for example for some

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
components and there are some parts

118
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
which are supplied to

119
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
supplied by type

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,600
tire 3 and so on so this this supply

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
chain can can be quite quite deep so

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
that's why there is n and the number of

123
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
companies which are which are working on

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,440
one vehicle is quite large so

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,919
so this uh this is a long list of

126
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,759
companies

127
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,400
and in terms of cyber security they they

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,520
need to follow all all the needs which

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,759
which are for any other company like

130
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,919
data safe safety

131
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,919
customer data safety because they are

132
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,199
working with with sales and contacts and

133
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,400
so on

134
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,600
and also they are usually manufacturing

135
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
some parts or some systems or whatever

136
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,639
so they have some some

137
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,600
factories which are usually automated

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
and there are some scada systems which

139
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,360
are which are used for for

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
controlling the the manufacturing

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,800
process and uh and

142
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
driving the the

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,560
steps and so on so

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,440
these systems needs to be also safe

145
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,160
from cyber security point

146
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
and also there are some additional needs

147
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,520
which are very different from from other

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,240
companies if we compare with a standard

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,919
ip company or

150
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,919
or something like that or a

151
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
company which is

152
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,280
not producing some some some parts like

153
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,319
a

154
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,000
big vehicle which is driving on the

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,520
street

156
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,560
because vehicle is complex connected and

157
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,960
at least partially automated mechatronic

158
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,199
system what does that mean this means

159
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,000
that

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,360
it's not a virtual asset it's a real

161
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,479
real

162
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,400
part of our life

163
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
and

164
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,520
we we need to take a big care about

165
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,319
this and uh mainly about the cyber

166
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
security of the vehicles

167
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,759
and there is a big difference between

168
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,520
between between the

169
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
vehicle and

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
other other connected parts of our life

171
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,319
if i mention laptop smartphone single

172
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,960
board computer or whatever device which

173
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,840
is somewhere

174
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,680
connected vehicles cannot be powered off

175
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
anytime i think this is quite uh quite

176
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
known if you are driving you cannot

177
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
power off the vehicle even if there are

178
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
there is some attack you are not able to

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
switch it off you are not able to

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,240
disconnect it or

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
for today's vehicle you are able but

182
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
for future vehicles this will not be

183
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
able

184
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,440
because

185
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,319
this this can cause some malfunctions

186
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,759
and so on

187
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,560
also you are not able to update the

188
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,240
vehicle anytime

189
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,440
because

190
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
there can be some

191
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,319
driving or the vehicle can be stopped

192
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,880
somewhere where it's not

193
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,960
not good idea to update it it can take

194
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
some time the driver needs to be sure

195
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,639
that he will not

196
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,360
use the vehicle in the time so it's not

197
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
not so easy

198
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
and also in terms of uh network in the

199
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,599
vehicle

200
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,039
there is uh 80 to 150

201
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,919
control units in a single vehicle

202
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,840
it's not one one processor and and some

203
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,639
stuff

204
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,400
it's uh for example 100 of

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,960
processors which are interconnected by

206
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
some networks

207
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
and some of them are quite big

208
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,759
in terms of

209
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,639
computation power and so on they usually

210
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,360
have some linux systems and so on and

211
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,000
part of them are based only on bare

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,880
metal they have some firmware but also

213
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
they are interconnected with all the

214
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,479
vehicles by some buses and so on and

215
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,200
they play some role in the vehicle those

216
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
can be for example

217
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
door locks or

218
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,720
or lights and so on each each actuator

219
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
and some of the sensors

220
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,399
is represented by some control unit and

221
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,360
this needs to be safe in terms of cyber

222
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,839
support

223
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,959
and

224
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,600
importantly vehicles usually carry

225
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,560
people

226
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,600
so

227
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,279
any malfunction or security incident or

228
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,080
whatever can be dangerous not only for

229
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
them who are traveling

230
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,160
with this vehicle but also to do the

231
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,320
surroundings and because

232
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,279
if there is a malfunction and

233
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,480
the system doesn't work or there is some

234
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,240
communication issue and the the vehicle

235
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,279
is not not doing what you want as a

236
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,399
driver

237
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,279
it can have a serious serious

238
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,680
consequences

239
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,720
and

240
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,399
this is a point which i i wouldn't like

241
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,760
to see anymore but it happens

242
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,880
if if someone wants to make

243
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,760
a terrorist attack or whatever motivated

244
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
attack

245
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,519
vehicle can be used as a weapon

246
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,640
and

247
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,360
if you imagine that some vehicles can be

248
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,079
can be driven without driver

249
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,800
for example some some oems

250
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,480
are are testing testing

251
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,640
autonomous driving

252
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,440
and if you imagine that you can you can

253
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
drive a vehicle without sitting inside

254
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,360
it can be very very

255
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
very

256
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
it can have negative consequences yeah

257
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,839
and

258
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,040
even if if the vehicle is not not

259
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
possible to be driven without the driver

260
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,000
if this vehicle can be hacked then we

261
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
can have serious problems

262
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
and

263
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
yeah

264
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,800
if we are improving the vehicles uh in

265
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,720
terms of uh automated driving and so on

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
we are

267
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,320
adding adding some features or adding

268
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
some other actuators or automatic

269
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,600
automating the the hold the vehicle for

270
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
example if we drive by wire or steer by

271
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,079
wire

272
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,959
in introducing cruise control and

273
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
parking assistance

274
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,680
all these actuators or all these systems

275
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
needs to be needs to be connected to to

276
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,360
some network yeah if you imagine

277
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,800
20 years old car you have a direct

278
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,079
connection between the the

279
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,440
brake pedal and and the brakes

280
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,640
in the wheels

281
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
but today you need to have there some

282
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
some wires because also control units

283
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
needs to control the brakes

284
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,959
so

285
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,760
this

286
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,519
needs to be somewhere

287
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,720
somewhere available this signal to

288
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
control the brakes so this is uh this is

289
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,680
a possible security issue

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,440
another point is is individual payments

291
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
because if you are charging your vehicle

292
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,360
you are paying for in entertainment in

293
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
the vehicle and for some subscriptions

294
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,440
uh you need to pay this and the easiest

295
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
way is to include your credit card into

296
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,680
the vehicle and it will pay itself

297
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,560
so

298
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,519
if if someone wants to steal your your

299
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,440
credit card number

300
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,240
uh

301
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,720
this is another point where it is safe

302
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
so we need to solve this

303
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
and

304
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,040
last point on this slide is about data

305
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,320
privacy

306
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
and it consists of driving habits which

307
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,680
are which are

308
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,720
saved

309
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,600
due to several reasons for example tesla

310
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,639
is doing

311
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,360
it

312
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,040
to to block for some drivers uh the

313
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,760
the

314
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,120
autumn

315
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,839
the autonomous functions because they

316
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,560
are not driving safely so they cannot

317
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,680
use this

318
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,639
and also other personal data are there

319
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,170
like from from

320
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,800
[Music]

321
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,040
from planning the trips and so on so

322
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,839
this data needs to be safe and

323
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,200
and there is some some possibility of

324
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,720
some issues or incidents

325
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,440
so

326
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,519
if we are improving improving the

327
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,480
vehicles we are getting into into bigger

328
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,320
risk of some incidents in terms of cyber

329
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
security

330
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,639
other points are about about

331
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,519
unauthorized modifications for example

332
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,680
if we if we

333
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
see the vehicles in the streets and

334
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
they have

335
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,880
they have

336
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,240
troubles with

337
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,560
diesel particulate filter

338
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,880
some users want to remove this

339
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,079
at all not replaced because it's uh it's

340
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,800
expensive they want to remove it and

341
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,480
this

342
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,000
quite often

343
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
requires some changes in control units

344
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,240
otherwise the vehicle is not

345
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
working

346
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,639
so

347
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,360
this needs to be needs to be prevented

348
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,720
also

349
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,920
for example in these engines there is a

350
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,720
selective catalytic reduction uh you

351
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,399
probably probably

352
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,399
heard the name blue

353
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,760
so

354
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,240
yeah there are some users and also there

355
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,639
are companies which are sexualized in

356
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,760
this topic and they are removing this

357
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,440
this part and

358
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,480
and they are trying to modify the

359
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,279
vehicle that it will work also without

360
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,160
without this this feature

361
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,600
this is this both these points are are

362
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,079
damaging our our

363
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,279
our

364
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,160
environment so it's not it's prohibited

365
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,880
but

366
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,600
but someone tries to do this

367
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,399
and

368
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,320
there are also also

369
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,560
a lot of companies which are trying to

370
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,959
improve the vehicle in terms of

371
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,639
horsepower and

372
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,519
and other changes and

373
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,639
this

374
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,959
this is not allowed also so so

375
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,920
this

376
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,440
requires some changes in control unit so

377
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,519
this is not not allowed operation

378
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,480
and

379
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,519
also

380
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,800
other other part is vehicle test

381
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,839
and

382
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,880
there are three main main

383
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,959
main ways how to

384
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,399
how how the thiefs work today one part

385
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,199
is blocking of vehicle locking which

386
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,480
means that

387
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,279
if you are going to shop you only press

388
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,360
the button on your keys

389
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
and in the time the the thief blocks

390
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
this signal is wireless signal and your

391
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,440
vehicle doesn't lock and they will steal

392
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,199
it then

393
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,160
if you are not careful to see your your

394
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,000
blinkers and so on

395
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,199
uh there are also some some incidents

396
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,959
due to obd attack what means uh

397
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,759
if you are for example taking

398
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,880
something from your your taking out some

399
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,680
luggage or whatever they need only about

400
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,880
30 seconds to plug some some device into

401
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,759
your obd socket it's used for for

402
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,480
diagnostics of the vehicle it's near the

403
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,240
steering wheel and they are able to to

404
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,240
reprogram some some control unit and

405
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,199
then they are able to open the car and

406
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,199
they will only reprogram the control

407
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,360
unit then they will remove the device

408
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,000
from your obd socket and then

409
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,440
they they

410
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,839
will be able to steer the car without

411
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,320
damaging it

412
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,639
and also

413
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,440
one

414
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,880
one possibility is amplification of

415
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,399
keyless entry

416
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,839
signal

417
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,399
if you have your piece near the door

418
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,440
it's possible to amplify the signal of

419
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,480
the key

420
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,759
and

421
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,199
transmit it

422
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,400
near the vehicle and then it's possible

423
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,799
to open the vehicle and

424
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,280
start the engine and still

425
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
steal the car

426
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,799
so

427
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,000
these are these are some examples not

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,799
not all but uh but these these are

429
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,039
things which needs to be solved because

430
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,240
oems fleets managers and also users in

431
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,440
some cases

432
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,559
need to prevent this this accident for

433
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
this incident

434
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
and

435
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,000
they are they are requiring this

436
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,799
now we can we can see

437
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,160
the possible possible attack points we

438
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,960
have two color of lines

439
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,760
there are green lines which represent

440
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
today's attacks

441
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,960
and there are red ones which

442
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,880
which presents a

443
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,039
possible future attacks which are

444
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,960
expected in the future when the

445
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
connected vehicles will be will be

446
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,120
more

447
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
more

448
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,320
more

449
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
widespread

450
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,880
and if i go through the numbers for

451
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,640
example number one is connectivity to

452
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
from vehicle to vehicle so vehicles are

453
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,919
communicating to each other to prevent

454
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,120
the

455
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,799
crashes and so on

456
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840
and if this communication is

457
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,480
somehow compromised this can

458
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,679
lead to some

459
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,400
accident or whatever

460
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,039
number two is for example vehicle to

461
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,520
infrastructure communication

462
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,320
when the lights are are transmitting

463
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
signal

464
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,280
that there is green or red and if this

465
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,480
signal is not correct it's somehow

466
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,520
somehow

467
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
damaged or

468
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,280
or changed

469
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,400
this can lead to some issues also

470
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,000
uh three and four are connections into

471
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,840
some cloud so

472
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,880
for example oem has usually today some

473
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,440
clouds which which the

474
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000
the vehicles communicate with

475
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
and also you can imagine that a lot of

476
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,760
cars have some some apps which can be

477
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,360
installed into into the infotainment and

478
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,520
you need to update these apps and and so

479
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,799
on so this communication is also also

480
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,000
there and this can be a source of attack

481
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,120
and

482
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
number five is

483
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,440
is updating the vehicle

484
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,320
uh

485
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
the software and the firmware of the

486
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,280
controller image so if someone someone

487
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,080
can

488
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,640
can push there some malicious

489
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,799
source code or whatever

490
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
or binary or

491
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,760
anything

492
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,720
this can lead to lead to

493
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
different behavior of the vehicle and

494
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,120
security incidents

495
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
and

496
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,320
the last

497
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,679
highlighted part is is the operating

498
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,480
system of of the of the

499
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,679
main

500
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,760
control units in the vehicle because

501
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,799
they are usually based on linux and they

502
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,880
are not only bare metal

503
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,799
so this this can be also issue or this

504
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,700
can be also

505
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,799
[Music]

506
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,200
a attack point to the vehicle

507
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,080
and now some brief

508
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,559
brief description of cyber security

509
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,120
regulation in automotive

510
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,360
uh probably most important is type

511
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,400
approval

512
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,159
if some some oem wants to wants to sell

513
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,480
the vehicle in

514
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
in any country

515
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,679
they need to get the type approval

516
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,360
which means that

517
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,159
they

518
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,280
they

519
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
they need to clarify need to

520
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,280
need to say that

521
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,840
it's in

522
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,039
in in accordance with rules and so on

523
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,440
and there are two main parts

524
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,919
which is r155

525
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,799
cyber security management system

526
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,600
which means that each vehicle will need

527
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,400
to have some intrusion detection system

528
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,520
and

529
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,039
and other other parts of cyber security

530
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,159
solution

531
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,640
and second one is about software updates

532
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,679
and its management system so

533
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,760
this this is

534
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,200
the the oem

535
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,520
must clarify how they will do this

536
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,559
there are also other other

537
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
legislations

538
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,960
the most important is probably

539
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,080
iso

540
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,320
21434

541
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,919
it's about cyber security from design to

542
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,640
to

543
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,400
other aspects of of this field

544
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,460
and also other other

545
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,919
[Music]

546
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,480
iso norms apply to

547
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
automotive for example for all of board

548
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,280
systems like diagnostic tools

549
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,200
back-end servers

550
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,480
and everything which is uh off of board

551
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
of the vehicle

552
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,799
uh there applies uh the

553
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,559
2700

554
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,919
series of iso norms

555
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,679
and also we need to keep in mind

556
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,799
gdpr and other user beta privacy

557
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,799
regulations

558
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,760
and

559
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,679
we are expecting new regulations from eu

560
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,720
about uh about

561
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,840
the

562
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,960
cyber security incidents and their

563
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,240
their

564
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,880
reporting and so on and sharing across

565
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,600
the

566
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,320
states of eu and so on

567
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,760
now i will present our great solution we

568
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,559
are

569
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,280
working on three core products one of

570
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,159
them is uh can intrusion detection

571
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,159
system can ids

572
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,039
which monitors all the communications

573
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,200
within the vehicle on on can can bus

574
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,240
and

575
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,039
it

576
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,480
detects uh anomalies in in

577
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,280
in the communication if there is some

578
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
some message which shouldn't be there or

579
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,640
if some message is missing and a lot of

580
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,320
a lot of rule based algorithms

581
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,280
then we have ethernet solutions which

582
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,080
consist of firewall and ids ethernet ids

583
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,039
which

584
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,200
works like

585
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
like that it detects anomalies in

586
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,039
internet and ethernet communication and

587
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,120
it can it can

588
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,080
block some malicious communication

589
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,600
and at the end we do have a security

590
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,679
operation center called sock and

591
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,120
this tool

592
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,159
connects

593
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,320
or

594
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,000
takes the the outputs of uh first two

595
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,679
and it

596
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,640
it provides um

597
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,400
some some summaries for operators and uh

598
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,600
allows some some detailed analysis and

599
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
so on

600
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
so for example if we take can ids

601
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,320
we can see that

602
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,880
this this tool is based on some input

603
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,640
files for example

604
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,720
this can be ddc files which are

605
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,880
describing the can communication within

606
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,240
the vehicle

607
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,200
and

608
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
other other files which

609
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,080
which

610
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,880
are

611
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,559
capture files of communication which was

612
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,279
which was locked in in the vehicle

613
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,000
and based on these inputs the rules that

614
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,120
is generated and uh based on this this

615
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,400
rule set

616
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,000
we we prepare ids code which is then

617
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,279
then included in into some control unit

618
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,679
usually gateway or some high level

619
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,520
control unit

620
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,039
and this uh this code this ids code is

621
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,159
updated

622
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,039
based on on changes in the vehicle or

623
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,120
based in new

624
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
new algorithms which needs to be

625
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,000
included or based on some some known

626
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,919
known vulnerabilities and so on

627
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,559
if we take a look at sock

628
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,400
we can see that

629
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,840
we can get alarms from different

630
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,440
vehicles from different different

631
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,559
algorithms from different control units

632
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,279
and then we can see the overview of

633
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,880
what's happening

634
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,919
so if if there was some attack to

635
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,279
several vehicles we can see what part of

636
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,600
vehicles are are

637
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,520
are under attack and

638
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,559
we can do something for example

639
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,159
if there is attack

640
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,679
it it can be reported to the user or if

641
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,880
there is a

642
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,840
false alarm false positive alarm this

643
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,480
can this algorithm or this particular

644
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,120
[Music]

645
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,640
algorithm

646
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,640
id or whatever can be can be disabled if

647
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,919
there is

648
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,080
for example some some issue with tuning

649
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,200
and so on so this tool tool

650
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
provides uh

651
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,480
overview and

652
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,400
this uh this can be used for oem or or

653
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,360
the fleet manager or whatever

654
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,760
who is interested in this and

655
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
is able to use it

656
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,360
and

657
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,159
now i think we are going to

658
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,960
most important part of my presentation

659
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,679
which is about challenges current one

660
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,840
and future

661
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
ones and

662
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,320
one of the current current

663
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
current challenges is tuning of ids of

664
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,080
intuition detection system

665
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,679
and what do i mean with tuning it's a

666
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,240
process when we are trying to find

667
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,960
rules which which

668
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,039
describe the

669
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,600
communication in the vehicle

670
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,559
and

671
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,440
based on this rules we

672
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,799
we can

673
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,279
we can

674
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:26,960
we can

675
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,919
detect the the communication which is

676
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,840
somehow animal

677
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,399
so this is based on

678
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,880
as i told you before on dbc files or ar

679
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,600
xml files then we can use also

680
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,000
communication log files and some

681
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,159
additional data like

682
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,679
like

683
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,720
some additional description and so on

684
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
there are three approaches which are

685
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,320
usually combined

686
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,960
first one of them is desk tuning

687
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,159
so you only take take the descriptive

688
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,000
files and you tune the rule set and then

689
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,559
generate the code and and it somehow

690
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,200
works but this can work only for for

691
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,080
some part of algorithms only for some

692
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,480
basic yeah for example

693
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,720
detection of of

694
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,120
message ids and so on

695
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,679
but if you want to use some advanced

696
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,080
algorithms you you need to

697
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,200
you need to involve capture files

698
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,679
the communication log files

699
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,480
and

700
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
if you if you want to tune the

701
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,039
algorithms you need to have capture

702
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,320
files for

703
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,440
different

704
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,120
different

705
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,159
situations of the vehicle for example if

706
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,039
you are pressing buttons if you are

707
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,960
staying

708
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,760
idle if you are driving

709
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,000
if you are

710
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,200
going to

711
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
washing machine car washing machine and

712
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
so on because these are different

713
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,679
situations and the vehicle can can

714
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,320
behave differently in these situations

715
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,440
and based on these capture files you can

716
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
fine-tune the rule set

717
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,559
and there is possibility to self-tune

718
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,440
the ruleset and i think this is a big

719
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,520
challenge because

720
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,080
because

721
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,120
due to limited computing power in the

722
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,240
vehicle

723
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,200
you don't have a lot of a lot of

724
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,080
possibilities how to do this because

725
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,000
there is a pressure for for price so

726
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,240
no control unit is

727
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,039
is

728
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,320
more power

729
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,120
in terms of computation than it needs to

730
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,720
be so you have no space for for making

731
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,600
some complex uh complex analytics and so

732
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,840
on in the vehicle

733
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,960
so this is this is issue today i guess

734
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,720
and there are also other challenges

735
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,760
which

736
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
which we are trying to solve

737
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,039
one of them is vehicle configuration

738
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,360
for example if you have

739
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,080
one vehicle type and

740
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,360
the oem is selling this type with or

741
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,279
without cruise control

742
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,240
there is

743
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,640
one control in it which is representing

744
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,039
this cruise control and

745
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,200
in one vehicle this control unit is

746
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,159
there and in another vehicle the control

747
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,520
unit isn't there and you need to have

748
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,000
different versions of the rule set the

749
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,279
code of the detection mechanisms because

750
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,440
some messages are there and some

751
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,880
messages aren't there depending on if

752
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
you have cruise control or if you

753
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,919
haven't

754
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,240
and if you allow to

755
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,960
to

756
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,600
allow the messages of cruise control to

757
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,919
be transmitted in vehicle which doesn't

758
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,000
have cruise control

759
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,480
you can leave there some vulnerability

760
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,520
which can be used by a hacker to control

761
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,799
the vehicle yeah so this is important to

762
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,039
to tune the

763
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,360
the ids for

764
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,880
for particular vehicle and don't

765
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,559
let there any any open space for for

766
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,799
some attacks

767
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,200
also there is some pressure to

768
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,919
to

769
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,679
tune the vehicle to

770
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,440
tune the rules

771
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,840
as quickly as possible

772
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,600
and this means that

773
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,120
that it

774
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,279
it costs some money and

775
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,799
yeah it's

776
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,240
it's in

777
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,960
in automotive manufacturing process

778
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,760
where everything must be optimized so

779
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,679
yeah this this is also also a challenge

780
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,279
and the the rule for tuning or the ids

781
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,640
tuning is always trade off between

782
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,399
time and effort which is spent on this

783
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,000
the rules tightness which i described on

784
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
cruise control example

785
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,799
and

786
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,279
ratio of false positive alarms yeah

787
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,720
because you could you could

788
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,519
you could

789
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,559
ban some some messages which didn't

790
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,039
appear in some capture file because you

791
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,760
think that this cannot happen but there

792
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,080
can happen some some situation for

793
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,760
example if you

794
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
if you stop

795
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,640
in on the highway and press some button

796
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,440
and

797
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,760
something happens for example equal is

798
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,440
active or whatever

799
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,320
then

800
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,600
this

801
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,840
you can you can get for example false

802
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,799
positive allowance

803
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,360
another another big challenge is

804
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,919
long-term support

805
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,519
vehicles

806
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,600
need to be supported

807
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,960
and not only from point of view of

808
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,840
aftermarket parts and service

809
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,519
but also

810
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,960
from perspective of cyber security

811
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,679
if we can take an example of smartphone

812
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,640
you you can get updates

813
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,600
for one to three years or six to seven

814
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,679
depending on on system you use

815
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,440
and if you take a look on the table on

816
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,679
the right hand side you can see the

817
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,120
average lifespan of some some

818
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,880
some devices

819
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,519
if we see smartphone it's almost three

820
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,640
years laptop three to five router five

821
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,760
to eight

822
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,799
server three to eight and for passenger

823
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,760
vehicle and trucks we can expect 12

824
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,120
years yeah in in the eu

825
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,720
and for a heavy or or other

826
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,760
similar vehicles we can expect

827
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,360
expect 20 years of lifespan

828
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,799
and if you compare these numbers

829
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,679
you see that the vehicles need to be

830
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,960
supported

831
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,080
two to six times longer than

832
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,279
than standard consumer electronics

833
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,760
so you you need to keep the support for

834
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,399
these devices in in the vehicle for the

835
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,480
control units for the software for the

836
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,039
hardware

837
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,520
at least for 12 years

838
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,480
because

839
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,399
it's average lifespan

840
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,119
and a lot of vehicles are

841
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,520
also older if you if you see the

842
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,760
vehicles in in

843
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,560
in the streets i i saw

844
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,159
barbara and

845
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,599
and so

846
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,200
there are also older vehicles

847
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,960
uh if we are talking about

848
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,918
automotive supply chain this is another

849
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,239
big challenge because

850
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,520
this supply chain so how how the vehicle

851
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,320
is manufactured because oem

852
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,159
the the automotive brand is is not the

853
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,719
sub is not the manufacturer of all the

854
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,359
parts they are only putting putting

855
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,800
parts together

856
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,880
and manufacturing some some big parts

857
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,359
the supply chain is highly fragmented

858
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,520
deep and heterogeneous

859
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,280
what does it mean

860
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,920
it means that we we can see on this

861
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,280
example that oem is responsible for for

862
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,880
vehicle level

863
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,079
and then there are some suppliers tire 1

864
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,040
tire 2 type 3 tire 4

865
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,599
which are responsible and supplying some

866
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,400
parts and systems and so on

867
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,560
and if we take

868
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,079
this example

869
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,920
of powertrain

870
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,720
it consists of battery pack this battery

871
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,960
pack has some control unit and this

872
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,680
control unit has some software pcb

873
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,520
processor and so on

874
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,720
and this tire one two three

875
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,760
and four are different companies which

876
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,240
are putting the parts of the vehicle

877
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,359
together

878
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,760
or they are supplying the parts to

879
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,359
higher level

880
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,200
so this

881
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,160
this

882
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,200
this

883
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,680
companies or their products need to be

884
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,880
combined and handled together from the

885
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,599
point of cyber security

886
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,800
and

887
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,000
this can be quite quite important and

888
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,880
difficult task

889
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,560
if we recall from

890
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,920
previous slide

891
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,839
slides we have 80 to

892
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
150 control units and we need to cover

893
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,400
10 to 20 years of maintenance

894
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,880
this can lead to big issues because it's

895
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,440
a long time a lot of components a lot of

896
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,680
software parts a lot of processors

897
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,440
different processors

898
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,640
and a lot of stuff so this is this is a

899
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,000
big big challenge and automotive company

900
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,200
are are trying to handle this

901
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,359
and another point is

902
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,160
what will happen when the support of any

903
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,240
of the parts will end

904
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,800
we will disable the connectivity for

905
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,520
this vehicle or we will disable also

906
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,680
other functions like

907
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,800
automated driving and so on or

908
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,160
the user will be prompted to upgrade the

909
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,480
hardware the control unit

910
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,440
i don't know

911
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,040
this this needs some time

912
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,240
and

913
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,000
we are coming

914
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,320
to future challenges

915
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,200
because each vehicle will be connected

916
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,720
to the internet at least they are equal

917
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,839
and

918
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,160
most of them will be connected to oem

919
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,359
cloud

920
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,960
and also to the infotainment resources

921
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,480
okay it's happening it's not

922
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,240
it's not a

923
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,680
long future or it's not so far

924
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,760
it's happening and

925
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,400
this needs to be solved and there needs

926
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,680
to be

927
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,440
another another cyber security

928
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,720
solutions which which are keeping long

929
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,800
support for these systems

930
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,440
and which are solving the issues which

931
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
there are

932
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,720
also big question is who is responsible

933
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,280
for keeping the vehicles updated

934
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,960
because

935
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,200
if some some security or some incident

936
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
or accident

937
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,839
in worst case happens

938
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,839
it needs to be solved who is responsible

939
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:24,960
for this

940
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
in in case of uh

941
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,160
in case of autonomous vehicles this this

942
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,520
will get more important

943
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,359
and we are coming to the automotive

944
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,119
autonomous vehicles

945
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,599
there are new points of attack

946
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,800
because there are lots of sensors

947
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,400
computer vision and so on new treats

948
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,280
and also fleet managers are expected to

949
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,680
be more interested in cyber security

950
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,880
because

951
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,560
this will not be personal personal task

952
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,800
but this will be part of their business

953
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,000
so they they require

954
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,920
better better solutions for

955
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,800
cybersecurity

956
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,160
and

957
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,280
probably most important question is if

958
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,880
the software or firmware updates to

959
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,000
influence the vehicle type approval

960
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,680
if if you find that there is some issue

961
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,880
and you need to update firmware of of

962
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,040
some control unit for

963
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,800
more control units in the vehicle if

964
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,680
this will influence the the paperwork

965
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,839
which needs to be done for the vehicle

966
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,200
to to be allowed to to drive on on

967
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,119
on streets and highways and so on

968
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,280
and i think we are at the end of my

969
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,400
presentation thank you for listening

970
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,960
thank you for for attending this this

971
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,280
session

972
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,280
really nice hearing about this and i

973
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,359
really feel like i've i've been living

974
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,520
in the year 2050

975
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,480
uh for the past

976
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,160
um

977
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,440
very close

978
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,040
it's very close all right so let's make

979
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,640
it 20 28 then yeah for example 20 25

980
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,040
25 all right all right i'd better get my

981
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,760
driver's license then

982
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,640
um i have a few questions for you you've

983
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,440
really spiked my curiosity do you feel

984
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,119
like from what you've seen right now

985
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,960
that regulations are keeping up with the

986
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,880
attacks and especially with the best

987
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,800
practices that the defense industry has

988
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,280
acquired

989
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,319
i think

990
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,680
this is a good question i think

991
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,480
yeah the

992
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,160
i think this is

993
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,640
uh

994
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,599
i think oems

995
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,480
are

996
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,800
somehow pushed to solve this by

997
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,560
regulation

998
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,839
but uh

999
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,680
they also have their internal internal

1000
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,800
motivations to this so i think it's a

1001
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,040
combination because

1002
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,560
they they are aware of of issues which

1003
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,800
they can they can

1004
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,000
they can meet if they

1005
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,240
for example sell the vehicle which will

1006
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,640
be hacked so this is a

1007
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,280
reputation issue so they they are

1008
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,920
solving this also from their internal

1009
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,960
internal

1010
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,800
motivation

1011
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,920
and

1012
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,280
i think

1013
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,000
that the regulation is

1014
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,680
it's not very strict

1015
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,240
yeah it's strict in terms

1016
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,960
you you need to have some some

1017
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,800
measures and you need to have some

1018
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
systems but

1019
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,160
the the implementation is dependent on

1020
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,760
your systems and on your your vehicle

1021
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
and on your

1022
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,000
your

1023
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,640
choose of components and so on

1024
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,680
so i think yeah it's a good framework

1025
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,720
and

1026
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,160
i think

1027
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,720
it would be great if it is standardized

1028
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,599
and

1029
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,319
if there are some common components and

1030
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,319
yeah i think it works together

1031
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,640
yeah i think it's very interesting how

1032
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,960
you described it as being a combination

1033
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,839
of reputation but also public regulation

1034
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,079
it's never just one and it shouldn't be

1035
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,640
just one

1036
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
you know the type of person who as a

1037
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,160
hobbyist starts adding or subtracting

1038
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,240
features from their smart car

1039
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,560
in order to you know get a car that's

1040
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,400
closer to what they would like it to be

1041
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,640
but they're doing this without being

1042
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,440
an expert and without knowing

1043
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,520
much about cyber security for example do

1044
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,000
you feel like this kinds of experiments

1045
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
are exposing the vehicles even further

1046
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,560
to attacks

1047
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,170
[Music]

1048
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,119
it depends i think yeah because uh there

1049
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,440
are some

1050
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,400
for example for my vehicle which which i

1051
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,359
owned

1052
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,160
uh i i was adding there some some

1053
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,680
features for example bluetooth and s3

1054
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,880
it's a

1055
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,440
few years ago i think 10 years ago or

1056
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,800
something like that

1057
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,560
and yeah

1058
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,880
this was only about cutting some wires

1059
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,839
and adding there some features yeah

1060
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,440
and

1061
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,680
this was only in in

1062
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,319
in

1063
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,680
the

1064
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,680
for example i wasn't accessing the the

1065
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,000
engine and so on

1066
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,640
and i think

1067
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,560
for future there

1068
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,520
should be some way how to improve this

1069
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
uh this uh

1070
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,280
these functionalities of the vehicle

1071
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,680
yeah because i was adding bluetooth

1072
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,160
hands-free and it was connected uh

1073
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,720
directly to radio of my car

1074
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,160
and yeah it worked fine and i can

1075
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,960
imagine that if you buy today vehicle

1076
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,720
and then you will need

1077
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,880
some some improvement

1078
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,160
in five years i think there might be

1079
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,560
some some platform or or some

1080
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,760
possibility to buy a new entertainment

1081
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,839
and upgrade the vehicle and it

1082
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,480
doesn't have to be from from the oem it

1083
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,560
can be some some general

1084
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,520
and yeah you can place their raspberry

1085
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,400
pi or whatever and play with it but i

1086
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,440
think

1087
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,440
there needs to be some

1088
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,800
some

1089
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,160
some firewall to divide those those

1090
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,599
those systems from the vehicle

1091
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,720
driving engine and and

1092
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,280
this this part

1093
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,280
yeah i think it's a really interesting

1094
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,599
discussion to have right now because i'm

1095
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,280
sure you're aware that for example in

1096
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,119
the european union we're talking about

1097
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,800
the right repair

1098
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,680
and

1099
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,560
the right to repair doesn't come with a

1100
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,400
um

1101
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,880
a knowledge necessarily of how to repair

1102
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,440
a lot of hobbyists are more enthusiastic

1103
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,040
but sometimes they lack the full

1104
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,440
spectrum knowledge that the manufacturer

1105
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,680
has right so i'm assuming we're we're

1106
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,839
also gonna see a something like you

1107
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,480
described a firewall or a way through

1108
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,000
which you can add or subtract so much

1109
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,920
from the system of your car but without

1110
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,359
ever touching some critical

1111
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,359
infrastructure inside of it right i

1112
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,359
think this is important to keep there

1113
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,040
some some line which cannot be cannot be

1114
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,599
accessed or which cannot be stepped over

1115
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,440
and uh and keep those systems uh

1116
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,000
firewalled but i i'm not sure if it is

1117
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
possible but uh i've seen some some

1118
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
examples that uh

1119
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,680
that some oems are trying to to divide

1120
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,520
the vehicle to to some basic basic parts

1121
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,079
or the the

1122
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,480
how to how to call it the

1123
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,960
the critical parts and and something

1124
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,680
like that which will not not change so

1125
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,800
often

1126
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,200
and there will be some some parts like

1127
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,400
infotainment which could evolve

1128
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,359
quite quickly and might be

1129
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,960
might be

1130
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,720
reused or might be updated about two

1131
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,640
years or whatever i don't know i don't

1132
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,800
know i only heard something like that

1133
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,000
but we will see what will happen in this

1134
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,599
what you're describing sounds to me like

1135
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,640
the ring zero of a kernel you know yeah

1136
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,040
for example something like that there

1137
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,720
um thank you very much for your

1138
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,480
presentation this has been awesome and

1139
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,839
thank you for your presence at death

1140
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,000
camp

1141
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,960
um

1142
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,760
it was a great opportunity to share my

1143
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,960
share my

1144
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,000
thoughts and so on thank you thank you
