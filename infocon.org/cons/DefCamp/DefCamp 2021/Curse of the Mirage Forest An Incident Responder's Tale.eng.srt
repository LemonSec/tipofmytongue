1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,480
i would like to move on to danny

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,439
um

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,319
he says hi danny he says that in a way

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,280
threat actors are just like bandits

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,280
within dense forests

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,400
um danny henderson jr is a senior

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,000
information security advisor at

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,960
secureworks he will share his tale of

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,279
tricksters that leverage services

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,960
through search engine optimization

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,680
manipulation and google adwords abuse

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
then he has quite an impressive career

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
he spent 14 years serving the u.s public

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,960
sector in various roles and i'm sure

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,120
that he'll talk a little bit about that

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,960
too danny you have the bridge

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,680
hello everyone can you all hear me

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,239
yeah perfect sweet so i am going to be

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,480
handling your presentation

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,360
as your speaker and your storyteller

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,640
i also have bitey and in the mood of the

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,760
story

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
a d20 die

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,000
all right so let's begin

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,720
we begin this tale

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,680
with the dramatic reenactment of a real

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,760
event

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,560
of someone who wanted to get a treasure

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,799
but in the end

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,960
receive malware

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,679
this story

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,080
it's the curse of the mirage forest

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
so we have

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,079
some chapters to go over we'll start the

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,640
prologue the introductions of the event

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,960
and then we'll go into understanding the

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,840
threat

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,280
landscape

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,960
so the purpose of the threat

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
understanding and threat landscape is to

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,479
know how things came to be how mal

42
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,079
malvertisements came to be

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,640
and how it has shaped even worse this

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,520
year which will then tie into

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
the incident response tale that i have

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
itself

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,759
and lastly i will start sharing some

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,920
trait craft

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,759
some investigation approaches that many

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,000
people can take to assist

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,080
in their investigations to identify the

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,639
threat actors infrastructure

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,440
and

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,800
utilize what

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
services free or none free that's

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
provided by the company

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,520
that will by your uh company that will

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
be able to aid you in your research

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,080
so the prologue

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
we get our beautiful map and we got our

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
threat actor

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
just an ordinary bandit went to the

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,879
misty forest

64
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,800
or in this case understanding the way

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,640
that advertisements work

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,879
make everything more confusing for

67
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,640
normal people who traverse through the

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,879
internet

69
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,959
and he is the new keeper

70
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,080
so about myself

71
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,239
let's see so by myself i am

72
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,840
oops

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
no

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,280
there we go so by myself i've been with

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,519
the military for 12 years as enlisted

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,920
then i was civilian for

77
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,840
two years doing

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,239
contract and was a public service

79
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,239
employee

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,319
got bachelor's masters and various

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,720
certifications now i work as secure

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,560
works as an information security

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,040
professional but i'm also an independent

84
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,519
game developer

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,799
i do i work with blue team village for

86
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,040
community involvement and dead pixel

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
security

88
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,879
i like dungeons and dragons as per this

89
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,360
story tells and oh by the way i do

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,760
dungeon mastering so if you ever need a

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,680
dungeon master

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,920
all right we shall kick off with the

93
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,840
story after

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,360
the adventure uh the adventurer from far

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,599
away

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,400
so the main purpose of this is to

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
understand the threat environment how

98
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
everything came to be

99
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,640
you're wandering to the misty woods

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
so the threat landscape is dealing with

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,879
advertisements in general

102
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,720
an advertisements was discovered back in

103
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,560
2007 through various researchers this

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,280
was at the time of the adobe flash

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,160
vulnerability that was exploited on

106
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,720
rapsody and myspace websites

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,360
and it slowly started evolving more and

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,840
more throughout the years where you have

109
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,440
modern ads such as google doubleclick

110
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,199
and other various

111
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,600
type of flash related

112
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,479
activities which has gone away once

113
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,040
flash died at least that um threaded

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
attack factor rest in peace flash

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
overall the advertisements are a we're

116
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,360
very perfect for watering hole attacks

117
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,520
because everyone goes to the site and

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
the threat actor once they compromise

119
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,320
that site gets a wide net of users who

120
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,680
go through

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,759
which leads us to the process of

122
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,000
infection

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,919
it's leveraged through the through the

124
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,199
compromise web server so it can be your

125
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,960
content management

126
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,680
systems or

127
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,800
the

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
website itself and the users who visit

129
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,400
the website receive that drive by

130
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,320
download

131
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,560
and there's even times that you'll be

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,199
they'll be redirected to the bad on to

133
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,440
the malicious site

134
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,320
a more popular one that was utilized

135
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,080
long ago but

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,000
have decreasingly

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,360
been used

138
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
is the exploit kits so those generally

139
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,960
targeted flash microsoft silverlight and

140
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,479
oracle

141
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,800
now to note about it it started dying

142
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,360
away once people started edging away

143
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,319
from

144
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,800
internet explorer and microsoft

145
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
attempts to

146
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,759
deprecate internet explorer

147
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,440
mozilla and chrome were

148
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,919
once once those were established

149
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,720
threat actors started not having

150
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,479
an attack vector

151
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
through the exploit kits anymore

152
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,120
however

153
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
around october

154
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,840
mid-october researchers discovered that

155
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,240
there are some threat actors that were

156
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,520
doing some tests on chromium

157
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,440
and it was successful enough to give a

158
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,120
indicator of

159
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,280
what syst what windows version that

160
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
they're using

161
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,240
so that is a pre-course to

162
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
an indicator that you could start seeing

163
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,440
exploit kits coming back targeting

164
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,960
chromium

165
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
browsers

166
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
but that's more to come as the years

167
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,758
develop

168
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,800
now that we've now that we've gone into

169
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,400
part of the

170
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,319
deep dive of how advertisements came to

171
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,639
be we're going to be more targeted

172
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
towards the topics at hand

173
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
so google analytics

174
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,840
has been

175
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,880
a very good attack vector that the

176
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,240
threat actors have abused

177
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,000
and google's analytics

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,960
have been abused

179
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,199
prior to 2021 they've all been they

180
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,840
mostly been scam oriented

181
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,880
so there's two two aspects of

182
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,680
of the google analytics one one of them

183
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,319
this one is not just a google

184
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,879
e um and that one is the search engine

185
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,639
optimization

186
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
now web developers love using it because

187
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,560
it helps get their website's exposure

188
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
and more exposure the

189
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
the website gets is better for the

190
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
analytics puts their pages on the front

191
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,319
on the from

192
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
first search

193
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,639
threat actors saw the same thing

194
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,520
hence why they started using it around

195
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,840
for a couple of things most the most

196
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,479
infamous one that happened this year was

197
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,960
the gootloader which was a javascript

198
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,800
based rat

199
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
so it was leveraged when the threat

200
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,360
actors compromised mostly

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,199
wordpress or any other content

202
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,840
management

203
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,000
system as a delivery mechanism

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
now when visitors would visit those

205
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,799
websites

206
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,679
the there's a javascript that would

207
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,440
do analytics to see

208
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,240
what the ip address is what the

209
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,839
what type of browser they're using and

210
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,320
so forth

211
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,560
and just to go back let's rewind it a

212
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,880
bit so most of these are through

213
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
searches so people are doing a lot of

214
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,680
searches so good loader for example

215
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,279
was done when people are looking for

216
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,959
certain documents such as

217
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,040
trying to down i'm trying to download a

218
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,959
law template

219
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,399
of trying to put maybe a document to

220
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,000
help them with

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,640
getting their rent what's the re was the

222
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,680
rent

223
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,399
template for say romania

224
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,040
threat actors would have that server

225
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
pop up as the result

226
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,040
now going back to the site where the

227
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,800
person goes in

228
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,080
if the user met the threshold

229
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
then the threat actors

230
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,839
website will show something like

231
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,480
this on the top right corner

232
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,279
where it looks like a fake forum post

233
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,920
and someone has the direct link which

234
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,279
will take you to

235
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,440
another malicious link to actually get

236
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,519
obtain the file

237
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,600
now if the person nev did not meet the

238
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,240
requirements that compromise website

239
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,320
will just show

240
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,800
normal text that looks like it makes

241
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,720
sense and then it starts becoming more

242
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,920
gibberish as you read on

243
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,600
so lets you know that it it you're not a

244
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,560
potential target

245
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,040
so when people download the document it

246
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,519
was actually javascript file and once

247
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,519
they double click the javascript file

248
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,399
the malware started running

249
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,079
and this allowed for other attack effect

250
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,880
other

251
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,200
programs to be installed

252
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
particularly ransomware

253
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
so as we are now in the age of

254
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,600
ransomware this was a good opportunity

255
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,200
for threat actors who leveraged that

256
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and another one is google adword

257
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,800
now

258
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,240
we this one involved the z-loader event

259
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,440
but before we go to the z loader

260
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,760
we first start seeing

261
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,279
google adword being used maliciously was

262
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,440
around 2014 the tail end of it

263
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
it was a scam campaign that went by it

264
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,640
was covered published in january 2015

265
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,959
that was at least the first instance of

266
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,880
the at google adword being used

267
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,920
now google adword if you look on the

268
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,680
bottom right of the screen

269
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,320
it just shows the website and that

270
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,880
particular

271
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,079
ad that you um like a sponsored ad

272
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,519
to get the person to the website faster

273
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,839
now this case with the screenshot this

274
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,760
covers the target event which occurred

275
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,680
in 2017 where

276
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,600
anyone who's trying to go to the big

277
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
retail targets

278
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,680
would be redirected to

279
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,239
a malicious a scam call center

280
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,680
so in

281
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,920
that that case

282
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,519
actually

283
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,440
another instance that we've had was

284
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
the brave browser incident as well

285
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
now 2021

286
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
this deals with

287
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,480
back to the z loader incident

288
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,880
z loader was usually sent through

289
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
phishing but this year was the first

290
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,760
instance that we've seen

291
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,160
that went on that went through an

292
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
indirect

293
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,839
attack

294
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,920
so the person would do a search

295
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,680
for what they're looking for the

296
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,319
particular pieces were either zoom or

297
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,320
team viewer

298
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,639
and the it would show the result for

299
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,959
user to go to the website

300
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,959
and they would start getting the malware

301
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,920
now this malware had a dropper that had

302
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,279
a lower

303
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,240
rate of detection so at the time that it

304
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,399
kicked off no malware was able to do no

305
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,079
security solution was able to detect the

306
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,760
malware

307
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,079
now that we've recovered the z loader

308
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,839
this actually leads to

309
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
detail of the incident response story

310
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,120
itself

311
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
we call it

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,359
the encounter

313
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,040
we present the victim who has risen

314
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,160
from his grave to approach the adventure

315
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,920
and to tell

316
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,320
the adventurer his tales

317
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
so that previous dramatic reenactment

318
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
is this user who has come to tell his

319
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
tale

320
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,279
so the tells of the victim he at this

321
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,920
time the user at that time the user was

322
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
preparing for

323
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,519
a meeting at school

324
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,880
and when they were

325
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,600
trying to search for zoom for the

326
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
application

327
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,959
the ad that popped up now i'm going to

328
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,680
note in the screenshots that this is a

329
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,040
notional

330
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,320
provided image as there was not no other

331
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,120
reports that showed how it looked like

332
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,079
from the

333
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,639
victim's point of view so i

334
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,480
felt that would be appropriate to show

335
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
you all the point of view of the victim

336
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,760
so this is what the victims saw

337
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,639
they saw the zoom download

338
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,320
what they thought was zoom but

339
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,800
what they did not catch

340
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,600
was the trap

341
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,160
this led to a critical failure in their

342
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,399
perception check

343
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,480
they did not know that they were the

344
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,360
victim to malware

345
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
so once the user um and that file came

346
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,639
in the form of an installer

347
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,720
so once they used the zoom installer

348
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,440
they started going into

349
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,040
it's own of course

350
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,519
so once it started installing it loaded

351
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,120
multiple packages

352
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,160
one of those packages also includes the

353
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,720
aterra agent which was used as a back

354
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,120
door

355
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,320
one of the one of the scripts that ran

356
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
or one of the first functions that the

357
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,760
malware did was

358
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,120
run a powershell script to disable

359
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,880
window on windows

360
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,279
defender

361
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
so once it started to once it

362
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,680
disabled the windows defender

363
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,040
it started adding its additional payload

364
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,279
and one of those payloads was crowd was

365
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,680
the crowd strike sorry not crosstalk

366
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,399
cobalt strike

367
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,800
cobalt strike being used

368
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,240
now i highlight this in black because

369
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,040
this one triggered alert

370
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
the threat actor he was there for about

371
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,320
a couple of days and he had intermittent

372
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,680
connectivity due to being off the the

373
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,199
due to the user

374
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,240
the victim

375
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,800
being off of the company resources so he

376
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,920
was off

377
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,279
the vpn

378
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,279
that that it was used to connect to the

379
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,959
company environment

380
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,959
so the threat actor had to just live in

381
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,120
the in the guy's land in his own

382
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,199
personal network for some time but once

383
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,680
he got access again

384
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
he used a couple of tools to start an

385
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,440
enumerated environment he used 80 fine

386
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,360
to enumerate the users the computers

387
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,399
the organization units and the shares he

388
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,000
had a lot of information from that

389
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
then he tried to use the invoke share

390
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,240
finder powershell script to enumerate

391
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,399
the shares which

392
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,120
when we defined that out or when we

393
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,279
uncovered that there was no information

394
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,880
from that host

395
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,160
so that one looked like it was

396
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,120
unsuccessful

397
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,800
now we go into the hero's turn

398
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,920
so back to the part where i highlighted

399
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
earlier that it was a cobalt strike

400
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,160
signature

401
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
we reviewed our security solutions to um

402
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,079
to um to further investigate

403
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,600
any previous activity that followed that

404
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
so once we started

405
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,880
drilling in and getting our findings

406
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,359
we were able to confirm the threat

407
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,159
role initiative

408
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,119
once we rolled our initiative we had our

409
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,240
party

410
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,559
one the first instances that we had to

411
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,799
do was isolate the host

412
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,599
however we ran to the issue that at the

413
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,199
time the user

414
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,359
system was not connected in a way that

415
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,039
we could isolate it

416
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,000
so we pass it off to the next team

417
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,960
that's in our 15 the network team

418
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,880
they had to use the network access to

419
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,559
control to completely remove the person

420
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,160
from the network

421
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,039
once that system was off the network

422
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,200
we worked with the

423
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,679
identity access management team to have

424
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,480
the user's account disabled

425
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,360
so we're able to through that um point

426
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
we were able to isolate the host

427
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,919
prevent threat actors from having his

428
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,400
turn in initiative

429
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
however there were a couple of questions

430
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,880
after this encounter

431
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,080
one how far did he get in

432
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,320
two was there anything else compromised

433
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,600
three

434
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,480
how much information did he have

435
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,559
so we had to work with the compromise

436
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,880
system that was confirmed to be able to

437
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,679
get

438
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,840
further information so this goes into

439
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,400
the analysis phase

440
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,320
and this is what's considered post con

441
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,120
pulse encounter so we had a lot of other

442
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,919
teams to work with

443
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,559
we had we stood up a bridge

444
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,480
brought up the stakeholders

445
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,360
we had the local it team help us with

446
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,440
getting the triage data

447
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
so we can do our investigation to know

448
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
what was on the computer what was the

449
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,880
when what was in the event logs what was

450
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
in the network log what was the

451
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,320
user's browser logs

452
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,039
and because we identified that the user

453
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,400
that the

454
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
compromise account the threat actor was

455
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,799
able to enumerate the

456
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,640
active directory

457
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
we had the active directory team reset

458
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,360
the

459
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,159
kerberos golden ticket

460
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,400
next up we had to work with the

461
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,160
privileged

462
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,400
access management team to lock down the

463
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,440
domain admins

464
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,720
so we need to be able to be analyzed all

465
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,280
the logs for a couple of days however we

466
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,000
had to make sure that none of the ad

467
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,679
domain admins could take those accounts

468
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,880
which would

469
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
allow the threat actor to take it

470
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
if he had those credentials

471
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,720
and then from there the sock had to

472
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,320
identify and review any other indicators

473
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,200
now once we start going through there

474
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
that took some time so in the meanwhile

475
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,880
we had another part of our team

476
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,240
monitoring the network during that

477
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,000
lockdown period

478
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
so one part of team was to focus on any

479
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,679
domain admin activity because some were

480
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,760
allowed because they need to do

481
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
some specific work

482
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,000
while the others were to analyze all the

483
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,760
artifacts that they found

484
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,559
the good thing was that only one of the

485
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,400
systems was

486
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,640
compromised the uh there we found

487
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,559
eventually found another

488
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,159
one but it didn't install the malware

489
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,919
so that one thankfully was not

490
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,760
compromised

491
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,000
but overall it was only scoped to one

492
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,919
system

493
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,720
and we were able to establish that

494
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,919
the threat actor did not get in so once

495
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,039
the analysis period ended over the over

496
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,640
that lockdown period

497
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,320
operations were

498
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,679
allowed to resume on a big scale but we

499
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,640
still had a lot of work to do to analyze

500
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,520
everything that happened

501
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,120
let's drink be merry

502
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,159
this is where we get to share some of

503
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,320
the um tradecraft on investigation

504
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,799
approaches

505
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,720
how do we find how do we find the

506
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
infrastructure the bad guy how do we

507
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,799
find everything during that triage point

508
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,280
because we it's going to take a while

509
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
for

510
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,240
actual

511
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,760
threat intelligence t threat

512
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,440
intelligence to provide further

513
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,960
information but there are things that

514
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
you can do during the incident response

515
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,120
phase that gives you a bit of that

516
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,678
homegrown threat intelligence capability

517
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,080
so during the investigation we had the

518
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,320
preliminary preliminary artifacts that

519
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,919
was found during the triage period from

520
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,840
the local i t team so

521
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,440
earlier i mentioned the event log

522
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,799
browser logs and so forth

523
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,840
we so we had some leads

524
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,600
of what the app what the person was

525
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,840
going to we

526
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,600
have one of the domains is not going to

527
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,720
be listed on here because it's too long

528
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,080
but

529
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,000
you'll see that in a bit

530
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,960
but the file names was the

531
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,440
zoom installer and the tim which was

532
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
the z-loader itself

533
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,320
now the installer i was given the md5

534
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,960
hash we were given md5 hash and we

535
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,159
reviewed it

536
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,360
the screenshot below was of that md5

537
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,640
hash

538
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,520
but it did not say zoom it said

539
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,840
teamviewer

540
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
so upon initial look because everyone

541
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,280
was still like trying to figure things

542
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,159
out it was almost written off as

543
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,320
okay that's just a regular zoom

544
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
installer

545
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
but then

546
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,640
you look at the domain that it was

547
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,320
pulled from

548
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,200
which

549
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
was a teams

550
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,679
dash

551
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,240
viewers dot site

552
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,720
which match the same way as the zoom

553
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,799
video dot sight those were not

554
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,440
legitimate so we started understanding

555
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,720
that this was not

556
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
a

557
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,640
legitimate software so i'm also going to

558
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,360
note at that time

559
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,400
uh so this image was recently so but at

560
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,039
the time this was marked as clean

561
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,520
so no no there were no malicious

562
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
indicators though there was some

563
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,080
community comments at the time

564
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,039
so we started tracing around from

565
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,880
the site to

566
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,559
other domains that

567
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,559
were connected

568
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,240
now unfortunately with the

569
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,360
finding the associate domain for the itw

570
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,840
urls that requires an enterprise account

571
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,400
but you can still see

572
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,559
what it communicated to and the name

573
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,440
from

574
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
the free version

575
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,000
next up

576
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,960
so this was the long one that

577
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,200
i mentioned earlier

578
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,400
this was where the person went to this

579
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,840
to the in issue url to make the down

580
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,679
when they went to

581
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,320
the zoom.com through google search this

582
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,840
is what it led to

583
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,720
and then the downloader was from the

584
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,120
next site

585
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,799
so we use who is to find some find the

586
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,120
indicators

587
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
there was some commonalities during the

588
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,360
infrastructure search

589
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,279
from the

590
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,200
the registrant name

591
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,440
who they registered to

592
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,400
the

593
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,240
you email

594
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,159
phone number we start getting the

595
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,200
pattern

596
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
and in that pattern there was also the

597
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,559
creation date

598
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,720
so at the time this was around

599
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,159
september

600
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,840
september the

601
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,400
7th through 9th so we start seeing that

602
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,440
the infrastructure register on the 26th

603
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,799
of august

604
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,400
and another one

605
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,400
prior um event was on the 18th of august

606
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
so we started understand that there was

607
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,559
infrastructure set up a week or so prior

608
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,400
and then this one was set up the day

609
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,279
before the compromise which was a cobalt

610
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,200
strike 2 server

611
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,919
that's why this one's different

612
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,840
so url scan so

613
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,600
if anyone's like me and i'll i'll admit

614
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,000
to this before i would always do just

615
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,960
private scan but i stop myself

616
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
and you can all you can use url scan

617
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,520
here to search for

618
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,440
to use the search function to see if

619
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,120
anyone else was

620
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,799
was tracking this

621
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,640
and you get the indicators that someone

622
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
was tracking it

623
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
by the search results so at the time

624
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
this would be more useful time of the

625
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,600
incident it'd be more useful but you get

626
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
an indicator that this started at least

627
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,399
on the second

628
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,000
now to bring the story together

629
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
it took the threat actor one or two

630
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,880
weeks to stand up the infrastructure

631
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,960
before the starter operation so it shows

632
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,159
how fast they can get things stood up

633
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,000
when it for preparation for when it's

634
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,520
time

635
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,480
so we

636
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,400
understood that it probably started at

637
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,640
least september

638
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,279
and the lures used during that time was

639
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,840
zoom in teamviewer

640
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,400
now senile labs published this on

641
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,360
published this report on the 13th and

642
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,279
most of the details from that report

643
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,080
corroborated with the initial analysis

644
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,640
so there was some vindicate there's a

645
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,559
vindicating feeling

646
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,080
when you see

647
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,960
how accurate you are when you

648
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,200
do the analysis of the event at the time

649
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,799
of the incident

650
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,840
to get the feel of hey how was i right

651
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,158
on this

652
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,440
some takeaways from here

653
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,720
my advertisements are not going away

654
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,799
and they may potentially become more of

655
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,880
a common indirect attack factor for

656
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,159
ransomware

657
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,440
as we been seeing the age of ransomware

658
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,200
kicking off the past two years and with

659
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,520
the report of

660
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,480
the

661
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,960
targeting of chromium and the testing

662
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,200
rather exploit kits may come back

663
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,799
and these were the references that i've

664
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,120
used for this report

665
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,159
to get an understanding of

666
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,799
advertisements

667
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,919
i thank a few people thank you people

668
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,240
for this this is

669
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,679
one person who is the pixel artist who

670
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,919
created these he has two projects he

671
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,320
also created some of my one of my custom

672
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,080
pixel artists arts

673
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,279
of the

674
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,640
threat actor

675
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,840
battle

676
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,200
and

677
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,080
dunam who's the person who created my my

678
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,159
avatar

679
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,760
and my team secure works

680
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,320
this is my contact information

681
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,279
and painting further questions that is

682
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,679
the end of the tale

683
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,679
thank you so much danny what a lovely

684
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,799
tale um and also i love the hat and i

685
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,279
saw it in one of your slides and the

686
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,640
pixels and and everything um i think

687
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,000
everyone had fun in in the past 20 or 30

688
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
minutes um

689
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,120
we only have i think about five minutes

690
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,360
for a question

691
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,200
all good

692
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,399
but um

693
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,399
i was wondering

694
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,720
what do you feel that's going to happen

695
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,520
on a ransomware front in in the coming

696
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,919
year because we're preparing to wrap up

697
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,200
2021 and how do you think these would

698
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,399
impact um

699
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,880
albertans malvertising in general

700
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
they'll probably see it more as an

701
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,399
additional means of

702
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,000
er like normal

703
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,200
it may possibly ramp up or may not

704
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,559
the thing about the advertisement is you

705
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,679
don't see it as much as you do fishing

706
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,840
sort of deals so it's more or less i'll

707
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,039
probably try to take it when it's

708
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,559
unexpected

709
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,360
something i didn't note was that the one

710
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,799
operation with good loader that took

711
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,360
through about 300 servers to manage

712
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,880
because it was that was not a small

713
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,279
scale operation to manage those servers

714
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,880
so that's how they were able to boost

715
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,039
the

716
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,120
boost the um search engine optimization

717
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,559
so something like that is probably going

718
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,559
to be very costly but may they may seem

719
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,039
to see the benefit of it

720
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,240
now google um map so google adwords will

721
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,080
probably continue because we've already

722
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,679
seen it back in 2014 we've seen in 2017

723
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,000
in google they've been they've been

724
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,360
they've been trying

725
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,880
we've seen some efforts in them in

726
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,559
blocking off malicious at where but

727
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,520
they can't be everywhere

728
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,159
and where do you think the defenders

729
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,840
should focus their efforts

730
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,159
and that one's on that one's on that

731
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,159
one's tougher so

732
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,080
one of the things we also looked into is

733
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,960
um

734
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,559
pushing for ad blockers within the

735
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,480
within the um

736
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
not just community but also corporate

737
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
workplaces they should start using the

738
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,520
ad blockers because even the government

739
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
even nsa and

740
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,679
the cyber security

741
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,640
and infrastructure security agency

742
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,200
have recommended that people use ad

743
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,960
blockers so this may have to be

744
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,720
extending to the

745
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,640
companies themselves

746
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,559
now google

747
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,880
now google's um search engine is going

748
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,799
to be tougher to

749
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,880
to manage

750
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,640
just because it's all it's all based on

751
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,279
the search results but

752
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,880
the ad blocker actually probably would

753
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,480
have worked against that one because

754
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,840
that one was javascript based

755
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,480
but anything like the adwords gonna be a

756
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,039
little tougher

757
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,559
yeah and one last question sure i think

758
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,360
that you're based in bucharest right yes

759
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,919
yes okay tell us about our exp your

760
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,640
experience in in romania

761
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,000
ah so i came here last year 2021 during

762
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,480
the pandemic july actually i flown in

763
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,120
from germany that was when i said my

764
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,960
farewell to the government forever and

765
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,279
decided to make romania starting my new

766
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,880
life and new home

767

i've enjoyed it here i got a good group

768
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,120
of people that i work with i enjoy

769
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,519
my the company i'm with and i'm pretty

770
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,600
happy with everyone that

771
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,080
i interviewed with when i was trying to

772
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,519
find a place to stay in europe

773
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,600

774
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200

going to be one of my to-do lists i know

777
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,760
that's going to be tough

778
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
but that's going to be one of my

779
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,320
to-do lists but i like it here i've

780

790
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,000
bored

791
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,519
just by talking to them what are your

uh when you say that you've moved here

796
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,960
um

797
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,720
most of them are used to it because i

798
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,039
lived in japan i lived in korea

799
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,640
part of my military life was being

800
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,480
everywhere around the world but

801
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,960
doing it as a gover as

now a non-government person

803
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,320
uh it's usually fun trying to sync up

804
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,000
with them because some of the folks i

805
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,519
work with are also

806
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,679
part of my game development team so i

807
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,200
