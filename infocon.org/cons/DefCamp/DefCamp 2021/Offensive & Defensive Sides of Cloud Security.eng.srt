1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,679
now on to our first presentation

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,160
we've all seen the memes right about how

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,680
the cloud is just somebody else's

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,480
computer funny as it is it also points

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,639
to the very true fact that the cloud has

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,400
a surface attack area just like all

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,679
computers do

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,279
when it comes down

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,439
to it there's a plethora of challenges

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,680
both on the attack side and on the

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,519
offense side of things

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,279
i'd like to introduce you to christiane

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,359
corna who is a penetration tester and a

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,519
security researcher and he's here to

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,439
talk to us about all the aspects of

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,920
cloud security christian we're ready to

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,000
hear all about it

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,520
thank you thank you very much for the

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,719
introduction

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,239
uh i'm glad that you are all here today

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,200
um i hope that you had a good break

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,719
before we

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,079
because we'll touch a very tough subject

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
about cloud security

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,960
uh let me share my screen really quick

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,039
okay it is all right

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,600
um

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,040
so

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,000
will

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,360
speak about offensive and defensive

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,159
sides of cloud security

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,320
um i'm christian cornea of pentester

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,759
and my passion is to break into things

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,560
especially let's say hype technologies

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,320
such as cloud

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,840
and let's

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
let's begin

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,119
let's

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,600
see a brief introduction into cloud

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
security

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,040
uh

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,640
what is cloud uh many many people have

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,399
this uh

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,600
question

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,240
and i have a simple simple definition

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,479
for cloud

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,520
cloud is a collection of

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,280
of resources that can be accessed

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
within the internet

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
uh basically

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,920
ip addresses hosts

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
observers

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,199
everything that can

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,959
be accessed from the internet from your

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,680
pocket especially

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
within your mobile phone

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,720
and

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,520
that

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
you don't have

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,520
to connect physical to those resources

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,680
there are multiple cloud deployment

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,800
models

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
uh

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
one is private cloud which is basically

65
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,200
your infrastructure your cloud

66
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
deployed on premise and just you have

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,680
access to to this

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
then it's public cloud

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,800
which is offered by many vendors

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,760
nowadays such as amazon microsoft google

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,640
cloud and so on so so forth

72
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,519
um then we have hybrid which is a

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,440
combination of private and public cloud

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
um and let's

75
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,640
take a look at why people are moving

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
nowadays into the cloud

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,360
uh the first reason basically is

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,879
mobility

79
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,680
we

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
we can access the cloud uh from any

81
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,640
device

82
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,360
and from anywhere in the world

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,319
um

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,360
while we have an internet access then we

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,680
have scalability

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,440
we can scale our resources very fast

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,000
uh based on our needs and requirements

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,920
uh then we have uh risk transference

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,720
from

90
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,319
um

91
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,120
from a security point point of view

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,799
because

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,080
we we are not responsible anymore for

94
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,599
some parts some components of our

95
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,959
infrastructure

96
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,640
uh

97
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,319
this case applies when we are moving to

98
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,959
a public or hybrid cloud

99
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,680
when we have a private cloud there is no

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,439
risk transference

101
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,200
we are responsible uh entirely for for

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,319
our cloud

103
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,560
um

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,918
there is a big uh difference between

105
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,759
cloud versus on-premise basically cloud

106
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,080
is like ordering something from a

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,520
restaurant so it's already prepared

108
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,000
already done for you

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,880
and on premise it's like cooking

110
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
the meal yourself so you need

111
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
ingredients you need

112
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,400
dishes you need the skills to

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,680
um

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
to make that meal so

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
yeah that's that's basically an analogy

116
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,280
of cloud versus on-premise

117
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,080
and there there are multiple types of

118
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,639
cloud services

119
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,240
let's walk through some

120
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,280
common

121
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,160
uh types of cloud services we have

122
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,400
infrastructure as a service

123
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
such as

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
amazon ac2

125
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,400
uh

126
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,360
where

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
they

128
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
give us the

129
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
um

130
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,400
the servers

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
the virtualization

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,520
all the

133
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,199
the infrastructure

134
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,520
and we can scale that

135
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
then we have platform as a service

136
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,039
which is used mainly for

137
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,560
software development like heroku and we

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
have software as a service

139
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
for example slack which

140
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,400
are

141
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,680
basically

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,560
uh

143
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,520
all the applications and

144
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,960
uh software that we are using nowadays

145
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
uh

146
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,320
like zoom zoom is a software as a

147
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,520
service for example

148
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,039
okay we discussed a brief introduction

149
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,759
into those cloud services but we have

150
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,600
here security risk

151
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,319
risk related to each cloud's

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,440
service

153
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,759
we have

154
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,919
basically

155
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,560
different and various risks

156
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,199
for for each one because

157
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,680
each cloud

158
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,720
service

159
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,639
comes with um different responsibilities

160
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,680
for us

161
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
uh and different approaches different

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
features

163
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,319
uh different resources and so on so

164
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,360
forth so they are basically different

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
um in infrastructure as a service let's

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
take some common risks for

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
for this cloud

168
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
service

169
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,680
we

170
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,720
we have

171
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,520
some

172
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,120
misconfiguration at the the services

173
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,160
level so maybe we have wrongly

174
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,319
configured uh on file transfer on one of

175
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,639
our server that is deployed in our

176
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,160
infrastructure as a service

177
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,120
model

178
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,960
we have

179
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
probably exposed some critical protocols

180
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,840
like

181
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
remote desktop

182
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,840
access with anonymous or guest access

183
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,800
uh there are the risk of

184
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,759
uh

185
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,039
explo uh exploiting the

186
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,759
out of dated environment because in a

187
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,120
infrastructure as a service we also have

188
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
to to be very careful uh because

189
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,479
we have a much greater

190
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
responsibility than platform as a

191
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
service and software as a service we

192
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,319
have the infrastructure security

193
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,039
responsibility so we we must be uh

194
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,720
aware that

195
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,199
those are not managed

196
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,639
uh by our cloud service provider and we

197
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,919
manage the

198
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,120
the infrastructure layer

199
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,039
so we must

200
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,479
keep it

201
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,759
up to date

202
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,039
we we must keep operating systems up to

203
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,240
date in order to to prevent

204
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,599
exploitation of

205
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
known vulnerabilities that have been

206
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,280
found

207
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,080
on

208
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,680
older operating systems

209
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,319
then we have the risk of denial of

210
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,919
service or distributed denial of service

211
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,159
for network and transport layers because

212
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,080
we are also uh responsible for

213
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,799
the traffic management

214
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,440
uh in a platform as a service

215
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,720
uh the risks are not um

216
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,920
so

217
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,440
um

218
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,800
so higher than

219
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,440
infrastructure as a service because our

220
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,959
responsibility

221
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,760
uh

222
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,800
was

223
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,839
shorter

224
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,839
basically

225
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,519
there is um

226
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,120
a possibility of injection of bacters in

227
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
software that we develop through a

228
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
platform as a service

229
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
we have virtualization risks

230
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
um and

231
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,360
a very big issue with platform as a

232
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,519
service

233
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,760
is that there

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,720
are

235
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
uh

236
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,959
possibilities of exploiting

237
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,959
um

238
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,000
the

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
the missing access controls

240
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,839
so

241
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,959
some platforms as a service comes by

242
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,839
default with

243
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,800
unrestricted access controls so we must

244
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,399
define

245
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,920
a good

246
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
role and access

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
based metrics

248
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,959
so

249
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
we will give people

250
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,399
only the

251
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,680
the required permissions and privileges

252
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,080
that they are

253
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,160
in need to complete their everyday tasks

254
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,839
um

255
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,800
this is this is basically related to

256
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,440
principle of list privilege

257
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,000
um then we have software as a service

258
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
disk

259
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,640
which is basically as we described uh

260
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,160
previously

261
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,279
um

262
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,800
is

263
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,399
composed of

264
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,720
all the applications

265
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,680
not all but almost all the applications

266
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,399
we

267
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,480
we see every day um we must be

268
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,839
very careful

269
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,079
uh what code we put on on our software

270
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,720
as a service

271
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
model

272
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
we because because we we may

273
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,880
place there um some

274
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,720
vulnerable or misconfigured code

275
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,279
and that will permit attackers to

276
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,000
to just gain access to the underlying uh

277
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,560
infrastructure underlying layers

278
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,920
um

279
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,000
of of the model because we just

280
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,519
misconfigured

281
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,279
something or did not uh implement

282
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,480
best practices when it comes to

283
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
code development

284
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
so we have web-based

285
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,839
exploitation threads

286
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,920
so basically just be aware that um

287
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,640
developing secure applications in a

288
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,320
software as a service

289
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
uh model

290
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,480
is our responsibility

291
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,760
then we have also virtualization threads

292
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,000
like in platform as a service

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,120
and we have application layer denial of

294
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,560
service because in a software service as

295
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
a conclusion we are

296
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,319
responsible for the application layer

297
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,920
let's move to

298
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,120
a more interesting topic

299
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,720
let's see some

300
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,600
black box attacks on on the cloud so

301
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,519
unauthenticated attacks on on the cloud

302
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,040
uh but first let's define

303
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,839
uh the differences

304
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,959
penetration testing on cloud and

305
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,040
security audit on cloud

306
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
penetration testing on cloud is

307
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,240
basically the process uh

308
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,480
through which we apply our hackish

309
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,839
methodology

310
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,120
to

311
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,480
to find vulnerabilities on the actual

312
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
cloud deployment

313
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,200
and we go from an external

314
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
unauthenticated perspective

315
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,440
and we must see

316
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,639
how far

317
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,200
we we can go

318
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,000
when

319
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,120
a cloud security audit is basically um

320
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
meant to

321
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,320
to check some configurations

322
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
of the

323
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
cloud platform

324
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,959
for example

325
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,160
in microsoft azure we can do a cloud

326
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,399
security audit using uh cis benchmarks

327
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,519
and that's just the cloud security audit

328
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,560
uh it's basically done from an

329
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
authenticated

330
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,920
high privilege

331
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,279
level

332
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,279
up and we

333
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,160
just

334
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
check

335
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,199
buttons and we just check if best

336
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,519
practices are in place for for the cloud

337
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,360
deployment without actually

338
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,440
exploiting those or without actually

339
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
finding ways to

340
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,399
exploit those

341
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,560
so

342
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,680
how can we do a cloud security audit uh

343
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,320
it's very simple um

344
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
we can do it through cs benchmarks

345
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,000
uh

346
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
we can take a look at the csa

347
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,920
cloud controls metrics

348
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,800
which defines some

349
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,120
best practices for

350
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,040
developing a good and secure cloud

351
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,440
and we have some

352
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,880
automation

353
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,839
that can be very very very helpful

354
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,199
for for us uh we have tools and

355
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,720
resources

356
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,160
that can be found on on github or on

357
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,079
this link

358
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,600
um

359
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,480
okay

360
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,800
so let's move into

361
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,760
the most interesting part from from this

362
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,360
presentation uh we have black box cloud

363
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,800
fan testing

364
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,440
um and how can we do that

365
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,240
uh

366
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
most common

367
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,199
cloud pen testing

368
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,800
methodologies are and also

369
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,760
let's say bug monthly methodologies on

370
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,920
the cloud

371
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,880
are the following basically we can

372
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,160
enumerate public cloud storage

373
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,560
uh such as amazon s3 buckets google

374
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,680
buckets

375
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
of azure blobs

376
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,040
we can use google doors for that one and

377
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,079
we'll

378
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,279
uh have a slide where we'll present how

379
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,920
to to do that with google docs and we'll

380
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
actually do that

381
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,360
um and very very important we we have to

382
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,279
search uh

383
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,399
github

384
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,639
repositories and

385
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,800
the internet for

386
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
for cloud

387
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,000
secrets leaks uh you can you can do that

388
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,839
with this tool

389
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,360
ethics

390
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,399
um then we have password spraying on

391
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,399
cloud accounts

392
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
and of course uh

393
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,160
phishing for admin console access so we

394
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,240
fish users to to get access to their

395
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,360
admin

396
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,399
uh

397
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,720
console um and also we have a method

398
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,399
even if you say okay

399
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,720
how can we fish admin uh accounts for

400
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,000
their access if they have mfa in place

401
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,800
uh it is a very very simple way to do

402
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,519
that we have a specialized tool to do

403
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,440
that to to get also the access token

404
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
into the cloud uh admin console even if

405
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,079
the accounts are using mfa and we'll

406
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,920
look at that

407
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,719
a bit later

408
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
okay so uh

409
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,720
we

410
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,199
uh we talked about uh

411
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,320
the phishing

412
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,680
on

413
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
on cloud accounts to

414
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,600
to get admin access to the cloud console

415
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,959
uh and here we have evil jinx tool

416
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,119
which is a tool

417
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,199
that uh help us

418
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
to to do fishing

419
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,400
uh and even to bypass mfa to get access

420
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,240
uh the concept is very simple it will

421
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,599
instead of capturing uh the

422
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,720
credentials it will capture access

423
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,760
tokens so the session tokens of the

424
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,799
users

425
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,760
and we can just copy paste the session

426
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,360
token into our browser and

427
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,280
having all the access we we need for

428
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,000
for the admin console

429
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,120
and how we can do that firstly uh cloud

430
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,320
based

431
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,440
phishing is very simple uh because we

432
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,880
have a lot of domains to choose for

433
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,960
in this example i

434
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,320
took for example three domains that i

435
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,080
found that online that are available for

436
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,919
purchase are very very good um

437
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,200
domains that we can do in our phishing

438
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,600
uh assessments for cloud credentials

439
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,960
um

440
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,799
and then we can just use averagings to

441
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,320
uh to

442
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,120
get

443
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,840
credentials and to get the session

444
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,679
tokens and to bypass the multi-factor

445
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,480
authentication

446
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,840
okay um so

447
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,720
then we have another attack vector very

448
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,520
very

449
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,080
uh interesting which is cloud-based

450
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,720
subdomain stakeholder

451
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,840
basically uh on cloud we have multiple

452
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,440
services okay we we have for example uh

453
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,600
azure traffic manager

454
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,280
which

455
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,919
allows us to

456
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,039
basically make redirects view

457
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,760
logs of the traffic uh do bloat

458
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,120
balancing so so forth uh

459
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,480
we have the storage buckets for amazon

460
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,720
we have the cloud from cdn and we have

461
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,919
some

462
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,280
azure default web domains that is

463
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,799
related to

464
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,400
the azure web development part um

465
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,559
here for some domains takeover

466
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,918
it happens that

467
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,679
our

468
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,440
our targets

469
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,960
uh

470
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,320
have seen name records

471
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,840
pointing

472
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,799
actually to those services

473
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,039
um

474
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,840
without having them

475
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,120
uh

476
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,280
registered so

477
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,600
okay maybe a cname

478
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,240
uh record was left

479
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,960
uh

480
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,840
there

481
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,960
and

482
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,039
we uh

483
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,840
we don't have it uh

484
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,960
anymore

485
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,280
so

486
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,559
so uh yes let's

487
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,360
let's start with with the demo

488
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,120
um

489
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,919
we

490
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,960
will have a domain a subdomain tool to

491
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,919
target to see if it can execute the

492
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,400
takeover over this one

493
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,520
so

494
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
let's

495
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,240
see the cname records

496
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,679
for our target um subdomain which is

497
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,080
demo dot dev camp

498
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,918
demo dot online

499
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,640
yes so we have here um

500
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,840
the the subdomain with the cname record

501
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,480
that is point pointing to the traffic

502
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
manager endpoint

503
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,679
um

504
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,640
and we can define this traffic manager

505
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,600
endpoint into our azure console

506
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,960
um

507
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,799
to

508
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,960
to take over this sub domain and to make

509
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,120
redirects to any domain we want to

510
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,600
um we can even create a server and make

511
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,400
the redirect there so we'll have

512
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,440
almost

513
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,720
complete control but firstly we must

514
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,159
validate if this traffic manager uh

515
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,320
endpoint is taken or not taken let's

516
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,600
let's check okay i'll copy it here is

517
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,400
the

518
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,080
the azure

519
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,879
console we will go to traffic manager

520
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,640
just a bit okay

521
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,039
it is loading

522
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,320
good so no profiles defined we'll go

523
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,480
track manager and create

524
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,400
wait a bit

525
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,039
come on

526
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,960
okay

527
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,400
and here we'll input our

528
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,039
uh end point

529
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,200
and as you can see uh the traffic

530
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
manager endpoint is actually uh

531
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,679
available

532
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,159
the routing method would be performance

533
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,000
this is our subscription

534
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
and

535
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,080
we have already created a resource group

536
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,600
and we'll do create

537
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
we wait for

538
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,559
for our traffic manager profile to be to

539
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,200
be created

540
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,559
okay it's deployment in progress

541
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,760
with also a little bit for for it to be

542
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,480
successfully deployed and here we are

543
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,320
we go to the

544
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,559
resources and

545
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,360
here is our traffic manager

546
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,080
uh

547
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,799
console we go to settings

548
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,080
uh enterpoints

549
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,840
and click on add new endpoint

550
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,520
and if we have one endpoint defined in

551
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
azure okay but in this case we don't

552
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
have an endpoint already defined in

553
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,360
azure so we have the possibility to

554
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,400
redirect to an external endpoint we'll

555
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,360
put something like test okay and for

556
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,000
example we want to redirect to

557
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,240
google.com

558
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,159
uh location

559
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,159
no important and odd

560
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,640
we we wait a little bit let's see

561
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,840
where

562
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,480
it is our

563
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,679
here

564
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,840
and we

565
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,520
navigate to the

566
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,559
domain

567
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,879
it is loading

568
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,440
and here we

569
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,200
are actually on the on

570
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,400
the google page it's it's doing

571
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,039
a redirection on on google page as you

572
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,880
can we have successfully take over this

573
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,960
domain through traffic

574
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,039
manager service but also

575
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,400
let me

576
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,600
go back to the presentation uh but also

577
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,159
we have multiple services um just have

578
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,559
to to research a bit uh yes this is the

579
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,000
previous slide

580
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,039
uh

581
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,120
there were multiple cases in which

582
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,200
attackers were able to take over

583
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,679
subdomains through storage buckets and

584
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,840
points through wanna do right now in

585
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,400
order to wrap up the uh demo that

586
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,960
christian performed earlier is to ask

587
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,760
him

588
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,720
for one key takeaway that all cloud app

589
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,159
developers should adhere to

590
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,039
thank you thank you so uh

591
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,520
firstly uh you should take uh

592
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,679
basically questions uh for data storage

593
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,200
um approaches on cloud and

594
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
accounts you should have multi-factor

595
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,320
authentication
