1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,399
so now moving on to the next

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,960
presentation of the day who actually is

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,520
a great compliment to what elon just

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,240
told us to all of the details he just

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,200
talked about so we're very excited to

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,839
have a long time def chem friend and

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,039
speaker

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,800
with us today

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,960
muhammad mudasari amin is currently

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
doing his phd as the department of

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,880
information and communication technology

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,039
at the norwegian university of science

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,599
and technology he's done a bunch of

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,439
research over the years and he's shared

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,600
it in death camp um many times and today

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
he's going to talk to us

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,559
um

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,120
and today he's going to talk to us about

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,520
uh cyber range in a nutshell so how do

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
you build cyber age how do you uh you

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,960
know build a com a cyber security

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
training environment in a complex um

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,480
environment and how do you scale that so

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,239
that it makes a difference and so that

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,199
so many people can be uh involved

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,440
welcome we're really happy to have you

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,119
here okay so

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,600
i'm presenting cyber engineers so why

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
initial

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,600
there was a movie ghost initial so

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,520
things are very complicated so i'm going

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,080
to explain how

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,159
uh we are building such uh

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,920
complicated cyber range

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
uh using very simple methods

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,960
uh we use like model driven engineering

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
to specify like different requirements

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,080
for us

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,560
cyber range and executing those

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,479
requirements computationally

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,360
so first of all why we need

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,280
like uh

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,400
i like to have like some some

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
small intro myself

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,680
i'm like uh

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
as you should be like our phd research

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,640
fellow at

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,920
ntnu uh i have like written like 20 plus

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
research articles

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
and

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,479
right like

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,560
government policy documents for like

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
three three countries

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,360
i also read my lpt master oscp

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
osce and a lot of bunch of service

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
security certifications

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,318
he also quotes like the national cyber

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,919
security team of norway

59
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,840
and was also like part of like geneva

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
cyber security

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,760
center in

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,680
term of like executing cyber security

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,520
exercises

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
so why we need a cyber range because

65
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
uh the nature of warfare is evolving

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,599
there used to be like

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,599
people used to fight with hands

68
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,280
then the technology progressed then they

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
started fighting

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,879
using aircraft and then now they are

71
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,000
fighting on computers

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
so how they're fighting they are

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,599
fighting through capabilities what are

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,319
those capabilities uh we have to

75
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,400
uh analyze the literature and

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,959
identify those capabilities

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,920
so if we look at uh

78
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,040
us department of defense uh

79
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,680
uh they have like a cyber security

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
certification curricula for like their

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,319
personal to operate like in different

82
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,319
sector so they have information as soon

83
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,319
as technical and information assurance

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
management

85
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,599
there are other ones but these are like

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,840
the primary laws on which they try to

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,440
train and they have like multiple cyber

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
security certifications

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
which they prefer to people to have to

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,480
operate in a defense

91
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,879
in a sector industries for the existence

92
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,480
like for like

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
information insurance management and

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
there are other technical tools like

95
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
uh ceh and other certification like

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,519
information assurance technical

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,840
and they have like multiple tires so as

98
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,440
ion was talking about there are a lot of

99
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,920
certification and people have to like

100
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,400
figure people don't have like any idea

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,040
and how to figure out to take what

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,519
and their curricula is overlapping so

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,159
first part what we did is like before

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,680
before building this hybrid

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,599
we did like a study and identified it

106
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,360
was

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,640
those

108
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,200
overlapping topics and we just wrote

109
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,720
like this research paper and publish it

110
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
so we identified like 17 of those

111
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,439
overlapping and most of the the topics

112
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,200
that are being repeated

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,319
in those cyber security certifications

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
so we identified like

115
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
identified that like that for security

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
was like one of the most

117
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,600
uh

118
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,519
taught

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
in a skill in those cyber security

120
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,000
certifications other skills like that

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,800
teach about like forensics

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
cisco devices

123
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,919
and uh

124
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,400
simple analytical skills and stuff like

125
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
that so they teach in this cyber

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,080
security certification after creating

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
like this baseline of like

128
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,880
uh taught cyber security certifications

129
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,440
uh we thought to have like a platform on

130
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,440
which we can teach uh those so for that

131
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,840
we need to id like a cyber range so but

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,360
what is the cyber range there was like

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
no formal definition of it like before

134
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,919
2018 so people were building their own

135
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,360
test beds and

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
calling them cyber ranges and those test

137
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,960
beds

138
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,199
what they were doing is like

139
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,160
they were

140
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
launching like a

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
simple ctf red and blue team exercises

142
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
and stuff like that but the concept is

143
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
very wide based upon our study because

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,919
you know like a cyber range is used to

145
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,600
execute exercise at multiple level

146
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
operational technical and strategic

147
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,360
levels and we have to

148
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
target all those levels

149
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,479
to

150
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,960
conduct like a real realistic cyber

151
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,400
security exercise

152
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,240
so if we take an example from like uh

153
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,000
out of the cyber domain

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,280
and how people are doing uh training so

155
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
people are basically using like

156
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,720
uh

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,440
different simulators and what you called

158
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
uh crash ranges to like test and

159
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,240
validate different concepts so for like

160
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
uh training pilots you have like

161
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
simulators for like teaching people how

162
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
to shoot you have like firing ranges for

163
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,520
testing and validating your car's

164
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,319
strength you have crash changes

165
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,720
similarly you have fire drills

166
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
emergency evacuation rails and what you

167
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
call biohazard drills so executing such

168
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,919
kind of drills requires like not just

169
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,000
like operational capabilities you also

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,759
need to have like what you called some

171
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,360
people from management who are like

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,479
coordinating

173
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,440
the situation and people from the media

174
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,880
from the government and stuff like that

175
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,400
who are reporting the information

176
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,759
decimating the information and

177
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,000
helping different teams like teams on

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
the ground and teams in the offices

179
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
to like coordinate and perform like

180
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
specific actions

181
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,880
i guess like uh emergency

182
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,840
uh so we conducted like a detailed study

183
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
just to focus first on the operational

184
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,759
level of like the cyber security

185
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,960
exercise infrastructure and uh in 20 are

186
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
we able to contact this 2018 and we

187
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,440
finish this publish this in like 2019

188
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
and we come up with this cyber range

189
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,000
ontology this is now widely accepted in

190
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
like the academia and industrial sector

191
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,199
how like uh what capabilities should

192
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
cybering should have

193
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,960
like scenario

194
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
monitoring learning management

195
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,479
teaming and

196
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
environment so these are like the basic

197
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,960
concepts that were like used in a cyber

198
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
range and then we have like what you

199
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,639
called

200
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,080
there's some concept like what kind of

201
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,919
teams are there what kind of environment

202
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,120
physical

203
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
virtual or emulated or simulated what

204
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
kind of scenario because the scenario is

205
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
like the most important part it is here

206
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,000
so how this uh if we want to conduct

207
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,960
like a

208
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,319
cyber security operation how the

209
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,720
operation can be

210
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
executed with uh

211
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,400
which what are the phases of this

212
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,479
operation when it started whether it is

213
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,240
what are the injects injects is like a

214
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,400
concept when some people perform some

215
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,479
action in a cyber security exercise

216
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,360
uh something happens like uh

217
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
they got some access to information

218
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,759
whether this information can be used to

219
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
further progress the whole scenario or

220
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
not so scenario has like its own

221
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,039
timeline and it's uh people are

222
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,800
following those timeline different teams

223
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,639
behaving based upon timeline like

224
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,800
incident happen it was not detected

225
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,360
according to timeline um then we provide

226
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,680
like an inject like from like a media

227
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
source okay some incident is detected

228
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,599
into the blue team and the blue team can

229
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,160
respond to that incident so this is like

230
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,759
the cyber range ontology where we

231
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,599
presented the concept then we have like

232
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,039
the functional architecture of the cyber

233
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,720
range

234
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,479
here we say like it should have like a

235
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,720
button where you can access the cyber

236
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,479
range it has some management interface

237
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,800
it has some training education modules a

238
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,120
testing module scenario monitoring part

239
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,719
runtime environment accessor and data

240
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,640
storage of like scenarios

241
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,279
you can store like a scenario

242
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,760
like uh before the execution after the

243
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,320
execution or during the execution so you

244
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
can have like a repetition of the

245
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
scenario to like validate different uh

246
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,200
skill set of different teams

247
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
uh so this is like virtual environment

248
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,480
for capability training and testing

249
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
now uh with those capabilities uh we

250
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,399
when you have like this this kind of

251
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,240
environment you can like do like

252
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,519
exercises

253
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,240
uh cyber security exercises uh to test

254
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
different capabilities we have like

255
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,839
operational based exercises and

256
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,080
tabletop-based exercises operation-based

257
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
exercises are hands-on exercises in

258
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,600
which

259
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,959
you launch

260
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,880
like practical attacks like let's say

261
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
you there are like teams from like

262
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
hackers that are launching practical

263
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,920
attacks

264
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,519
using like kali linux machines on like

265
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,680
some remote servers and there may be

266
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,279
some blue teams that are like trying to

267
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,720
detect those attacks using shock or sim

268
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
solutions

269
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,920
now these are operation based exercises

270
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,160
then there are table top base exercises

271
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,080
in those exercises we have like a

272
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
scenario an incident happen

273
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
and you have like a team of managers who

274
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,640
have to respond

275
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
to that incident let's say there was a

276
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,959
like a ransomware attack happen on an

277
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,200
hospital and uh

278
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,360
hospitals you have to respond

279
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,279
and have to guide his like i.t people

280
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,399
and his security peoples to perform some

281
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,360
specific action so but the hospital is

282
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,519
also like obliged to like serve

283
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,760
the patients and other societal actors

284
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
like he have to like respond to the

285
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,519
government and the media and the police

286
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
so he have to deal with it

287
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,519
like what is the situation so here in

288
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,399
that in that table top scenario the

289
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,320
target audience is like that so it's

290
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,399
more like at a general level and

291
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,399
uh operation base is more like a trench

292
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,880
level so oppression for like in terms of

293
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
warfare like operation basis like trench

294
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,560
warfare and that

295
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
their tabletop is more like strategic

296
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
warfare

297
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,160
but uh

298
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,640
if we analyze like the status of like

299
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
those cyber security exercises we have

300
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,959
this what you call

301
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,800
report from an essay it was like from

302
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,959
2015 and it what it suggested it was

303
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,600
like that 81 percent of cyber security

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,480
exercises that were doing uh that were

305
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,800
conducted in europe was like a table top

306
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
waste and rest of like seminar and

307
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,959
workshops and only 11 are like operation

308
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
based uh

309
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
hands-on cyber security exercises

310
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,640
statistics from anissa then we looked

311
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,480
into why

312
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,000
it was like that

313
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,120
and then

314
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,720
there was like this very famous paper

315
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
for like

316
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
like a lesson learns from like 10 years

317
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,079
of cyber security exercises so they

318
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,480
proposed like uh from john v kepler uh

319
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,399
from czech republic uh here they

320
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,920
suggested like this cyber security

321
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,880
exercises have like a whole life cycle

322
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,120
they have like preparation dryden

323
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
execution evaluation and reputation

324
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,519
and there are multiple teams involved in

325
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,320
those in this lifecycle like white team

326
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
is like proposing like a scenario a

327
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,079
green team is like deploying and

328
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,160
maintaining the scenario a red team is

329
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,600
for like a launching attack and a blue

330
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,680
team is for like

331
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,440
defending so

332
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
there are they propose like there are

333
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,480
basically four teams that are like

334
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,160
involved in this operation by cyber

335
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
security exercises

336
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,920
uh so

337
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,800
uh

338
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,360
and uh so you see like it takes like a

339
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,600
lot of time like in designing and

340
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,079
executing cyber security exercises so

341
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,880
some like lock shield from nato uh like

342
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,519
took like maybe 11 months just to design

343
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,079
and execute the whole exercise so the

344
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,959
time for executing like a major exercise

345
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,199
that is

346
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,160
representing major societal actors takes

347
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,000
too much time not just like simple city

348
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but we are like proposing like to

349
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,760
execute like an exercise that is like

350
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,800
presenting

351
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,600
um major societal actors

352
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,839
but if you

353
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,920
see like uh

354
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,240
this operational topology of like simple

355
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,399
scenarios uh some some cyber security

356
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,079
scenario if you can just simplify them

357
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,839
so basically

358
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,440
if you should look at like for like

359
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,959
organizing like a simple city if it has

360
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,839
like like simple network topology

361
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,160
like uh one subnet for the attackers one

362
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
subnet for like the machines that are

363
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,839
going to be attacked and you are like

364
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,600
connected with a switch or a router to

365
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
just uh launch attacks

366
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,399
then there are like this attack

367
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,519
different scenarios in which

368
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,760
you have like a team of

369
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,240
attackers uh you have like a one team a

370
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
team and b team and they both have like

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,639
similar infrastructure and they're like

372
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,320
trying to patch their own infrastructure

373
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
and try to launch attack on the other

374
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,440
team infrastructure

375
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
and there are like this red and blue

376
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,279
team type access scenario in which we

377
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,519
have like a complex

378
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,519
multi-subnet environment uh that is

379
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,920
going that was being attacked by like a

380
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
attacker

381
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,519
by a team of attackers or a team from

382
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,880
outside

383
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,959
so these are like simple simplest form

384
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,560
of like cyber security operational

385
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
scenarios that can be used to make like

386
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
a big uh scenario for like multiple

387
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,320
societal actors but at operational level

388
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,959
they look like this

389
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
so

390
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,480
here are like i'm presenting how they

391
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,880
are like interacting within like uh uh

392
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,320
the different teams are interacting with

393
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,360
each other in like uh in during like the

394
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,680
exercise so like the white team is like

395
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,199
specifying the rules of like the

396
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,959
scenario let's say

397
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,480
uh specify what are the scoring

398
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,040
condition and guide the people like the

399
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
red red team and blue team if they got

400
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,320
stuck somewhere

401
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,920
then there is like this green team who

402
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,760
is like responsible for maintaining and

403
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,680
repairing the infrastructure that may

404
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,760
because that cause maybe during some

405
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,480
exploit that didn't work as expected and

406
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
that can crash some servers so they are

407
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,320
like uh responsible for maintaining a

408
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,360
repair

409
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,959
of like the infrastructure then there is

410
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,519
bluetooth who is like uh try to like

411
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,440
secure monitor and defense like the

412
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,120
infrastructure and the red team who

413
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,040
perform like attacks and scans and

414
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,000
penetrate within the like

415
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,880
proposed exercise infrastructure

416
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,560
then uh what we did was like we

417
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,399
developed this cyber security scenario

418
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,920
orchestrator

419
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,959
in which

420
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,920
we

421
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
try to like emulate the roles of like

422
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,160
the these different teams

423
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,040
uh computationally

424
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,600
so what we did was like first part what

425
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
we did was like we created like a

426
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,240
network topology model a

427
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,639
modeling interface that takes some

428
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,519
inputs like in json and can create like

429
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,680
a heat template it is like a technology

430
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,199
that is used for like

431
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,279
open stack orchestration so it can

432
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,360
create like a network topology based

433
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,760
upon the given specification so first

434
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,240
like we do this so a network is deployed

435
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,959
then we specify like uh vulnerabilities

436
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,639
that are needed to be present within

437
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,360
like the exercise infrastructure

438
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,079
and so these vulnerabilities uh uh can

439
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,759
be like everything like we call it

440
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,000
software services and configuration so

441
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,680
we specify them in like another uh

442
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,399
uh dsm our develop dsl we have like

443
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,880
domain specific language and

444
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
it creates like artifacts so if you want

445
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,959
to deploy like a

446
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,880
software that is

447
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,040
vulnerable to like maybe remote code

448
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
execution it takes that software and

449
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,920
install on it on like one of the machine

450
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
we use like a technology called silent

451
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,720
install so it can just uh install it to

452
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,079
through command

453
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,199
and through

454
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,560
it makes like a separate access

455
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,399
connection and install it on the system

456
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,720
automatically

457
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,079
then we have like the concept of this

458
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,240
traffic generators because like when we

459
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,040
have like uh

460
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,199
an exercise environment is set up we

461
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,880
have to make it what you call dynamic

462
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,639
and realistic so in the realistic

463
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,160
environment we have like what you call

464
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
people working in the environment so

465
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,240
what we do is like we take some what you

466
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,120
call

467
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,279
uh vnc automation technologies we use

468
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,279
like vnc tool we specify like the

469
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,600
behavior and forward it to like

470
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
uh the system that i need to have like

471
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,560
uh

472
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,959
human uh human interaction that that

473
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,120
some users are believing on the system

474
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
so what happened is like the gui of the

475
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,040
system start to behave like

476
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,639
some people somebody is using like the

477
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,120
system like the mouse inputs are going

478
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,440
in the keyboard inputs are going in the

479
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,360
system is opening emails and stuff like

480
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,279
that and click you know clicking on

481
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,199
stuff so it looks like the thing is like

482
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,160
clear and some people are using it and

483
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,400
then we have attack generation so what

484
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,919
we have we have like concept this

485
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,319
develop concept we have developed this

486
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
concept of

487
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,280
like uh

488
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,160
process execution trees so what we do is

489
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,559
like we specify like what kind of attack

490
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,079
we need to do

491
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,480
and it creates like a text script and

492
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
that is attack script is being executed

493
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,959
on like the system so when the

494
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,559
infrastructure is deployed some machines

495
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,919
are like the

496
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,080
kali kali linux based machines so what

497
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
happened is like that we have like a

498
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
open ssh connection

499
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
established from our orchestrator and

500
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,160
that can start launching like different

501
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
types of attack on different machines to

502
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,240
like penetrating them perform

503
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
exploitation post exploitation

504
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,919
and stuff like that automatically

505
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,080
we also created like a defense agent

506
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
that can be installed on like some of

507
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
the machines present within like the

508
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,600
exercise infrastructure what it do is

509
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
like that it try to identify the attacks

510
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
that are being happening on the system

511
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,240
and try to prevent them so it is

512
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,400
basically monitoring the logs

513
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
of like

514
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,320
and

515
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,720
if it detects some patterns in the log

516
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,960
that is like in its knowledge base it

517
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,600
can respond to those

518
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,520
attacks and try to

519
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
prevent attacker from accessing

520
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,679
different files and

521
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,520
maybe close the ports

522
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
just to like stop the attack to make the

523
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,400
environment realistic

524
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,919
and add friction in the exercise

525
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,600
so this is like

526
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,520
a what you call very dynamic and

527
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
realistic cyber security exercise and

528
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
i'm going to test it multiple times

529
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,799
and yeah i can show you some examples

530
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
here and there

531
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,880
so this is like uh

532
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,080
different

533
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,240
uh

534
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,080
snippets of our developed language

535
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,280
so first we use like a network topology

536
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,679
how we can define different networks

537
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,120
so

538
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,480
and you can just simply spell like i

539
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,600
want to define like a subnet i and space

540
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,080
its name is public it's the idea is this

541
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,000
and this is like a network id that is

542
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,640
given from like uh open stack so this is

543
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,600
like a

544
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,840
constant value from like network adapter

545
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,320
that can be forwarded to the machine

546
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
submit you can create two subnets and

547
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
you can also specify the machine i want

548
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,559
to like specify machine like a linux

549
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,440
machine this is os is like the image id

550
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
of like uh that is a image present in

551
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,640
the

552
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,280
cloud and yeah you can just specify like

553
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,160
an ssh key and what it depends upon like

554
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,840
you can say it depends upon public so it

555
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
will be connected with the public

556
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,840
network public subnet and specifically

557
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,039
you can specify 20 30 it doesn't matter

558
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,120
how many machines you can specify it

559
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,799
will do the things and it will deploy

560
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,720
the infrastructure

561
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,919
second you have to inject those

562
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,280
vulnerabilities

563
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,000
in it and what you can do is like you

564
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,440
can just specify like a vulnerability

565
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,559
like this and you can say like uh

566
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,440
i just uh want to do like

567
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,039
uh like this

568
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,158
uh just give me a second

569
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
yeah you want to inject like a

570
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
vulnerable program so you can just

571
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,799
specify like the executable of this

572
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,880
vulnerable program and it will go and

573
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,080
install there

574
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,400
on the system where you specify like you

575
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,919
have to specify like the machine ip of

576
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,520
the system where you want to install

577
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,760
them

578
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,799
vulnerable program

579
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,360
similarly if you want to have like

580
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,080
configurationally you can just specify

581
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,520
like i just want to set a weak password

582
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,320
on a system and it will do that see and

583
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,159
again if you want to have like run run

584
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,919
like in service on a system you can

585
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,520
specify like i have to run this docker

586
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
container on the system and it will just

587
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,280
do that automatically you have just to

588
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,720
specify like this

589
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,039
in the

590
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
dsl

591
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,440
then we have like this defender agent so

592
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
what this defender is into it takes like

593
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,720
this cs5 csv files in this csv files we

594
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,640
have like what you call actions and

595
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,679
reactions

596
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,159
actions contains like the pattern in the

597
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,520
event logs

598
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,440
where it is trying to detect and like

599
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
and reaction is like how to respond to

600
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,799
that

601
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,400
event so it is pretty fine like in the

602
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,520
knowledge base of like a different

603
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,559
religion

604
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,000
its background working is actually

605
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,559
presented like i think def cam 2019 so

606
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,480
how it is working how it is detecting

607
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,840
it's like

608
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,000
how it is monitoring the processes and

609
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,760
correlating the events to identify like

610
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,240
those actions and responding to them so

611
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
i have like a whole paper uh you can

612
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
just uh go and get the details from here

613
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,960
you can move forward

614
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
then we have like this concrete agent uh

615
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,120
of concrete center or like a attacker so

616
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,559
you just have to specify like what kind

617
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
of vulnerability it has to exploit that

618
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,760
will do that and what kind of post

619
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,919
exploitation so here i just specified it

620
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,080
just go and exploit like what you call

621
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,159
internal value on this machine so it

622
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,400
will just do that and then

623
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,520
there is like this crossfire

624
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,640
vulnerability

625
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
i can specify just go and find the

626
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,720
system running this crossfire and it

627
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,159
will expire that

628
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,280
and then

629
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
this wing ftp vulnerability if i just

630
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,039
tell them system just go and find the

631
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,360
system and it will go and explore that

632
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,960
so background it is using like mostly

633
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
metasploit and some other kali linux

634
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,799
scripts and

635
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,320
in meta spread it is also using like

636
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
resource scripts to performing post

637
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,918
exploitations automatically

638
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
so this resource scripts are like batch

639
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
files uh you can just specify like the

640
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,799
actions uh you you have to perform after

641
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,120
you like get like a metabolic session

642
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,720
and it will perform those action

643
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,159
automatically through the mattress

644
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,000
product agent this paper is not

645
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,600
published but it is

646
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,360
going to be published soon and you will

647
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,720
have like all the public details of the

648
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,600
public

649
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,280
working

650
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,320
how this is launching the attacks

651
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
now we move forward like some of the

652
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,840
outer strategic scenario that we did in

653
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,360
like our

654
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,679
uh for testing and validating the

655
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,919
cyberlink that we developed so this is

656
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,200
like a simple penetration testing

657
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,840
scenario so it was like uh

658
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
i have like 75 machines

659
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
that is designed for like 45 48 hours

660
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,919
long exercise 25 participants and first

661
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,840
time it took like design deployed in a

662
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,360
week because we were collecting like

663
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
vulnerabilities and

664
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
os images for like this penetration

665
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,880
testing exercise

666
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,480
so like these are like 75 machines

667
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,039
deployed in like uh

668
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,520
cloud and each uh

669
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
each node is presenting like a team

670
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,760
network that is like exactly similar to

671
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,159
other team network so they have like an

672
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,039
independent network infrastructure so

673
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,039
they are not interfering with anybody

674
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,960
else so they are just focusing on their

675
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,320
own task

676
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,360
then we have this attacker defense

677
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,520
scenario attacking defense so you have

678
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,279
like uh different teams are interacting

679
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,880
with each other and they have like

680
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,320
access to each other network and they're

681
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
like launching the attack so it has like

682
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,720
36 mission it was like also for 48 hour

683
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
long exercise 25 participant

684
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,120
regenerative blood in a day

685
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
yeah

686
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,240
no so yeah it was like a very beautiful

687
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,679
network apology now i'm going towards

688
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,760
like a big red and blue team exercise

689
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,880
scenario

690
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,440
and this red and blue team accessionary

691
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,240
we have like 400 plus machines

692
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,720
and it was like deployed in like uh

693
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,360
yeah and it was for like 72 hour long

694
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,520
exercises 34 participants and we have

695
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,640
like uh

696
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,960
designed and deployed like in few hours

697
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,480
because we have like developed most of

698
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,919
the technology at them we have like a

699
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,279
library of like

700
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,159
uh vulnerable uh softwares we can just

701
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,480
inject and we can just uh create like

702
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,840
network infrastructure so each node is

703
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,120
representing like

704
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,880
what you gonna network separate network

705
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,960
and which teams are interacting with red

706
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,480
and blue teams for like launching

707
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,960
attacks and stuff like that

708
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,200
also like so we can like deploy like a

709
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,960
thousand machine

710
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
uh network if we need it with no problem

711
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,799
these are actual virtual machines

712
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,880
running like windows linux and other

713
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,960
stuffs

714
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
then we move forward

715
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
for like how we can

716
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
link this

717
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,600
um

718
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,360
operational infrastructure with like

719
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,279
strategic infrastructure so there is

720
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,440
this guidance from like a dsb dcbs like

721
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,520
national emergency response center from

722
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,919
like uh in norway that provide guidance

723
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:08,880
how to

724
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,279
conduct like large scale exercises like

725
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,159
fire drills earthquake uh like a damn

726
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,080
bust how to respond it so they provide

727
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,240
guidance from them and then this is fema

728
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,440
from us government they provide this

729
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,279
now what you call planning and training

730
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,440
of exercises how we can like conduct

731
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,360
like a full scale exercise so they have

732
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,320
seminar workshops tabletop games drills

733
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,400
functional exercise uh functional

734
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
exercise and full scale exercise how we

735
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,840
can link them so they have like already

736
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
provided the guidance but not for what

737
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,760
you called

738
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,120
cyber security

739
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,799
exercises they provided the exercises

740
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,360
for general purposes

741
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,279
so i scale like this this full scale

742
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,720
like cyber security exercises involve

743
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,559
this strategical tactical and

744
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,880
operational aspects so we were able to

745
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,799
link them with our like operational

746
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,039
infrastructure i'm explaining how i will

747
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,520
explain how

748
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,000
so first uh i'm just starting because

749
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
i'm over time now but i'm just getting a

750
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
bit fast yeah so first we need to have

751
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,679
like an organization

752
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,600
on which we are planning to do like this

753
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,360
full scale exercise

754
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,159
um who we are training with and together

755
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,520
with who like which are the partners

756
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,360
that is going to be training we have to

757
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,039
analyze like to perform like a maturity

758
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,440
analysis availability analysis like swot

759
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,200
sim reports risk analysis

760
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
vulnerabilities scenario and operational

761
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
infrastructure

762
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,240
and then we have to perform the

763
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,919
execution we have to provide them

764
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,000
guidance like before the exercise that

765
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,840
we are going to do the exercise pretty

766
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,720
brief

767
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,480
and you may expect something happening

768
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,000
within like exercise infrastructure and

769
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
you have to respond then

770
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,440
we have like excellent exercise

771
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,520
controller teams that are like uh you

772
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,960
can consider them as battering they

773
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,880
may provide inputs in like creating the

774
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,279
scenario and like also provide injects

775
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,600
and help to other teams that are like

776
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,440
participating in the scenario we have to

777
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,200
launch system attack and we have to like

778
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,360
response and recovery means of like

779
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,919
after an attack

780
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,120
so

781
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,720
we have like different roles that are

782
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,120
present in like a full-scale exercise at

783
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,640
operational level we have to do a lot of

784
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
technological work but at this level we

785
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,320
have to do the deal with a lot of

786
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
managerial work we have like a crisis

787
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,559
management team that can have a ceo a

788
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,399
press coordinator a sectoral manager an

789
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,720
ict manager an information manager we

790
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,240
have a tactical team like they can be

791
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,279
like

792
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,080
um certain management team ict teams

793
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,600
information teams

794
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,279
and they're like interacting with those

795
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,840
guys so i just highlighted them who is

796
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
interacting with who

797
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,559
with different level and then we have

798
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,799
like this operational teams we have like

799
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,559
different teams like blue teams and

800
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,279
other socks sock teams and first in line

801
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,720
and next of kin

802
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,480
like if somebody but is not available

803
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,640
who is going to take his responsibility

804
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,039
and respond to his actions

805
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,760
so this is the way we have like

806
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,880
integrated

807
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,679
different team roles

808
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,279
either we i'm just presenting like a

809
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,840
simple cyber incident exercise

810
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,000
just to give you an idea how it happens

811
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,159
and how people respond to it

812
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,559
so uh this is just like a scenario which

813
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,880
we emulated in our cyber range here in

814
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
norway

815
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,520
uh hospital was attacked and

816
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,320
it's some data breach was happened and

817
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,120
uh yeah between 2006 and

818
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,640
2016 and 2020 this data was extracted 25

819
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,480
people patients were ratified that have

820
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,559
like their data stolen and yeah

821
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,399
different societal actors got involved

822
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,640
like police from real homework crippled

823
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
creepers creepers is like another secret

824
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,360
service here in norway and europol to

825
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,080
like investigate the crime

826
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,799
these were like seven different

827
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,200
services that were affected uh during

828
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,039
like the incident

829
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,200
i'm just getting a bit fast because i'm

830
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,720
taking too much time

831
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,159
so we didn't have like the exact

832
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,960
information but we assumed like uh this

833
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,480
this is like the sequel injection like

834
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,320
most probably somebody just compromised

835
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
like this

836
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,640
public facing website and got access to

837
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,159
that data link

838
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,159
uh but based upon this information we

839
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,240
created this scenario and emulated that

840
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,600
so we just

841
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
this is just for scale but just

842
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,679
explaining how the things are working we

843
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,520
have like a public interface in that

844
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,000
public interface we have like a

845
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,080
system connected to like a dmc uh

846
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
demolition that has access to like web

847
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,120
server

848
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,200
and that web server is like what you

849
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,039
call

850
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,879
like a database in like internal network

851
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,799
so this public network is also monitored

852
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,399
by shock and the whole network is

853
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,799
monitored by stock uh because it was

854
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,200
like used by like hospital uh hospital

855
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,760
staff because

856
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,360
they're extra circuit from homes so we

857
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,399
have like

858
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,240
traffic generators computational traffic

859
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,520
generators that are present in like

860
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,120
public network and we have like an

861
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,360
attacker that is also computational

862
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,039
uh that is launching attacks on the

863
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,000
network to compromise the system

864
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,440
okay so like two elements of the

865
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
exercise were completely computational

866
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,000
we have like real shocking real humans

867
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,360
for like training

868
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
for training purposes so like we have

869
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,840
like first inject like on october 1st

870
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,440
in that like they launch like an rsc

871
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,080
like i said 3.1.1 on like one of the

872
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,559
system and from that uh they just

873
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,559
uploaded like a remote file on like the

874
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,240
web server

875
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,760
like then the second object was like

876
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,919
that we have like a backload of like a

877
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,240
new user added for persistence of access

878
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,200
on the web server and then we like this

879
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,120
subreddit detected the first attack on

880
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,799
like second object so you can see like

881
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,440
there was like a difference between

882
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,200
four days between the exercise so we

883
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,360
actually started in our 20th so they too

884
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,880
is like i have to detect the incident

885
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
and respond to them

886
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,720
detected uh like the first attack and

887
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,880
also detected some false positive due to

888
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,799
traffic generators so this like this

889
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,960
traffic generated created what we call

890
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,200
the fog of war so you have like actual

891
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,120
like uh

892
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,320
incident with uh some other false alarms

893
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,840
so that can be provided to like

894
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
different teams at tactical and

895
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,240
strategic level that can hinder their

896
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,320
decision making process

897
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,640
then like on 29th october they which are

898
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,559
like a third inject online database

899
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,200
so this is like the actual uh attack

900
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,279
where we have performed the data link uh

901
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,440
soft sub detected the backdoor that was

902
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,559
uh law injected like a previous day but

903
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,559
it didn't wasn't able to like detect

904
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,519
like the database like

905
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,600
so what the action what they did was

906
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,440
like the strategy team the strategic

907
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,039
team didn't know like that what is

908
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,799
happening in the database and the

909
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,159
the stock wasn't able to provide the

910
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,000
information like data is being linked

911
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,320
but what they did was like that they say

912
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,840
like cut access to like the public

913
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,679
network so when they cut the access to

914
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,480
the public network so that uh

915
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,640
operation uh computational doctors and

916
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
nurses that are using the public network

917
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,880
weren't able to

918
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,519
access their services like uh what you

919
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,760
call perform their job so they have like

920
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,240
this disaster management

921
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,120
plan if in just in case if like in here

922
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,919
in norway if like this is now what if

923
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,279
the computational resources are not

924
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,360
available how to respond to them so they

925
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,519
can call uh like uh

926
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,399
uh help from like other uh communities

927
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,039
we have like municipalities uh to like

928
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,200
assist them and maybe they can ask like

929
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
military to intervene and provide some

930
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
assistance just in case and we have to

931
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,600
provide like what you call

932
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,279
information to like different

933
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,120
uh secret services like we have one in

934
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,519
smm nsm somebody is playing the role of

935
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,840
nsm so they have to like coordinate the

936
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,960
information with nsm so they can provide

937
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,399
and respond to them

938
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,799
uh provide assistance

939
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,720
yeah so this was good so this is like

940
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,360
the sample like attack and detection

941
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,719
happening like like example this

942
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,279
some sample emote information

943
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,880
simple sim report and yeah some

944
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,960
bluetooth like they detected like this

945
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,200
kind of incident here

946
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
on one of the ftp server this is like

947
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,919
done by like what you called

948
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,000
our computational agents but it was like

949
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,760
a fast positive so it created a lot of

950
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
what you call fear among the strategic

951
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,559
team like okay somebody is trying to

952
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,559
like ransomware them and maybe try to

953
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,640
like destroy the data

954
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,080
so they just

955
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
based upon this information cut the

956
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,039
access to the server

957
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,320
some of the logs that detected some

958
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,960
payload that was injected and the system

959
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,080
uh for the incident they detected so

960
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,799
they provided this kind of information

961
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,880
and like the how like the user was added

962
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,399
in the account and they detected that

963
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,279
and yeah this is just like what you call

964
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,519
their uh the stock input was like that

965
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,279
at the end of the day like they also

966
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,200
like uh suspected like medical record

967
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,120
theft because that server was running

968
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,039
some medical data

969
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,720
and they also provide like a lot of

970
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,640
information to that thing i can go on

971
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,240
and on how this sincere exercise

972
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,480
involved but i think i have to finish it

973
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,360
yeah

974
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,399
thank you

975
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,720
thank you for trying to cover as much

976
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,159
information as possible we're really

977
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,360
thankful unfortunately we cannot do uh

978
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,120
questions and answers right now simply

979
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,000
because we're a bit over time but uh i'm

980
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,159
sure that you know i i just want to let

981
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,480
our viewers know that they can

982
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,079
drop your questions in the chat and that

983
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,159
you'll be around to reply thank you so

984
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,599
much for being here and i hope you

985
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,918
enjoyed the rest of uh the deaf

986
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,000
experience as well thank you again so

987
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,239
much
