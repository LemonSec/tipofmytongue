1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
so now i'd like to introduce iwan

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,359
consontin cyber security expert at

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,600
orange he's been on the dev camp stage

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,160
many times there are some very

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,080
interesting and evergreen interviews

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,679
with him on the deathcam blog that i

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
hope you check out he's always super

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,640
articulate he brings a lot of wisdom and

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,760
a lot of insights to the table so uh

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
let's hear him talk about training

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,119
psychops education through gamification

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,359
welcome euron we're really excited to

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,519
have you again at deaf camp

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,360
hello thank you thank you andra thank

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,640
you for having me thank you for the

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,399
great introduction

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,280
um

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,840
it's uh it's been a few years

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,399
since my first time at death camp

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,399
and although uh i did have the

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
opportunity to share some of my um

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,960
wisdoms wisdom with you on stage this is

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,480
my first time that i'm actually doing

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,360
this from home in pajamas

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,320
uh so uh uh what i'm going to what i'm

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,800
proposing is that we have a bit of a

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,039
relaxed

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
storytelling mixed with some

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,720
presentation with some slides with some

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
insights we have

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
from our

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,840
involvement and our projects in

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,240
education and then uh maybe set aside

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,000
some five six seven minutes for some q a

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,520
and uh of course i invite you to

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,880
uh

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,439
you know connect to the other

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,200
uh to the other uh

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
the presentations and the other

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,600
interventions in this track and the and

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
the track two

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
uh because they are filled to the brim

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
with very interesting topics uh with

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,960
lots lots of interesting people of

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,000
course

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,240
i'm going to share my screen and this is

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,119
uh

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,240
one of uh the things that i'm actually

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,439
saying

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,520
i have to say at least

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,880
20 times each week there you go the

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,399
stage is yours

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,079
great thank you

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,320
um i'm going to go over some of the

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,439
things that we are doing to

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,320
better train and uh educate

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,799
young people um wanting to

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,160
uh you know engage in cyber security

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,400
um

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
and i'm going to focus on uh cycles on

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,640
security operations specifically and

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,080
this is because

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,319
as you will hopefully see

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,120
this has to do with the outcome of our

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
efforts in education

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,480
so

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,440
without uh further ado i'm going to jump

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,480
into this

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,599
um let's discuss a bit how

70
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,519
we usually go about or

71
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,480
go about learning cyber security there

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,360
are

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
different methods and of course

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
different uh ways of doing this but i'm

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
going to focus on the

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
you know the didactic method method and

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,640
the

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,319
self-thought method

79
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,519
um

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,400
and

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,120
there are of course some uh benefits of

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,959
going the the

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,440
curriculum learning uh way uh as in uh

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,599
you have the opportunity of learning uh

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,239
cyber security in some form in high

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,959
school or at university of course at

87
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,080
work

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,760
uh and uh

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,640
through

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
professional certification or to

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,840
continuous learning and improvement you

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
get to um you know develop your skills

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,599
uh and to

94
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,680
put them to practice

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,400
but

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,720
there is a um

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,159
a very uh large category of people that

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,159
are either thought

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,879
uh

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,480
as myself and uh i presume that some of

101
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,720
the people from my generation

102
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,159
and uh

103
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
they are still doing this they are still

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,040
learning

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,200
um at home

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,360
complementing the curriculum if they are

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
students enrolled in a university with

108
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
some sort of cyber security program

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,200
um

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,959
there are

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,040
they are maybe hobbyists and tinkerers

112
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,799
they like to

113
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,550
you know uh

114
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,720
[Music]

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,760
um

116
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,720
play with stuff and uh try to

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
try to put together uh

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
different different parts of uh you know

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
uh software and hardware that

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
shouldn't make sense being put together

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
and

122
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,120
of course there are hackers in the

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,160
truest

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,040
meaning of the world

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
but

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,520
going the autodidact way

127
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,479
um you are going to step into some

128
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,840
some challenges

129
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
uh there's a lack of agenda

130
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,040
you know you have to do it you have to

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,600
have this uh sort of um

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
very uh straightforward and very uh

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
organized

134
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,160
way of thinking and way of uh actually

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,720
you know putting together the

136
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,160
managing your time and managing the

137
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
knowledge and the references and the

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,280
resources you have access to

139
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,199
you have to self-evaluate you have to

140
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,080
know when is the time

141
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
when is the time to take the next step

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
and to learn and to learn some new

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,039
things or to

144
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,360
uh you know add some complexity to the

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,039
things you already know

146
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,479
and um

147
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
overall there's a lack of structure

148
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,919
but one thing that is common

149
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,360
to to both

150
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,039
methods

151
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,000
general methods is the practice

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
you have to practice you have to have

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
some sort of hands-on experience

154
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
in interacting with tools in the

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,919
interacting with processes in

156
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,919
interacting with other people involved

157
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,960
in cyber security

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
as a topic

159
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
so

160
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
what we

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
try to do

162
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,919
is we want to have

163
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,800
practice we we want to use the practice

164
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
the hands-on experience

165
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
as a a base an underlying factor for all

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,360
types of cyber security learning

167
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,199
and in order to do this

168
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
we developed some tools we developed

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,400
some competitions and we are working on

170
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,880
some very interesting projects

171
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
uh which i'm going to hopefully not bore

172
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,360
you with uh to the end of my

173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,560
presentation but until then

174
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,960
a bit of storytelling and uh it's it's a

175
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,800
bit of story time and i'm sure you heard

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
this like many other times but uh this

177
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
is meant to highlight

178
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
some of the things that we can um

179
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,639
actually push forward and actually use

180
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
and reuse in order to improve the way

181
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,840
that we

182
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,080
um you know we enable learning by

183
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
training by hands-on

184
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,440
so back in the 1990s and this is when i

185
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,319
started you know school and

186
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
started

187
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,960
interacting and using computers

188
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,840
uh somewhere in small town romania

189
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,479
you had

190
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,000
maybe two ways of going about learning

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,199
any type of knowledge related to

192
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,639
computers and to uh i.t in general as a

193
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,759
factor

194
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,919
uh you could do it in school

195
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,440
um but

196
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,400
unfortunately uh back then school may

197
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,360
thought you some basic windows stuff

198
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,759
some code writing in

199
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,960
very outdated languages at that time

200
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,919
um you could go about in and

201
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,599
learn some computer stuff outside of

202
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,199
school but this was

203
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,120
maybe one of two computer clubs in in

204
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,479
smaller towns

205
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,319
not sure what the situation was in

206
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,240
bucharest or inclusion but the

207
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
back

208
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
back then uh where i was born and i was

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,160
raised we had one computer club and we

210
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,919
mostly learned basic stuff on some

211
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,400
soviet zx close

212
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,160
which was very appealing at that time

213
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,520
but not necessarily useful for the line

214
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,240
um but

215
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,879
and in the late 90s we

216
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,879
we gained access to some form of

217
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,479
connectivity

218
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,520
uh

219
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,280
so we uh

220
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,039
we fetched some resources from the

221
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,120
internet and from some

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,240
late vds type types of

223
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
you know repos

224
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
mostly bootleg stuff you know swift

225
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,240
kitty stuff uh we i remember we were

226
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,360
amazed

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,159
um about um using something like black

228
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,519
orifice i'm not sure if you remember

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,760
that it was mostly and uh you know

230
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,719
remote admin tool but because the server

231
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,519
side could be deployed silently most

232
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
script kitties back then most hackers

233
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
back then uh we used to play some sort

234
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,440
of the you know practical jokes and

235
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,600
pranks on other colleagues in computer

236
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
labs and

237
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,560
and

238
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
some the basic uh

239
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,880
condominium networks you know like uh

240
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,360
installing the server side of that

241
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
that

242
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,720
software on their computers and then

243
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
um i don't know

244
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,920
remotely killing their

245
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
game the game that they were playing or

246
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,839
opening the cd-rom tray or something

247
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,040
like that

248
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,320
um

249
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,160
but the limitations of learning um

250
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
any type of

251
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
in-depth knowledge to to to

252
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,279
i.t and somehow related cyber security

253
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,880
was that we didn't have access to

254
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,399
technology

255
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,440
uh

256
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,360
technology was very limited uh then

257
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,279
there was maybe one computer per per

258
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,480
household

259
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,760
at best

260
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,920
we mostly use bootleg software

261
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,640
uh and that was not updated we didn't

262
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,080
have the new features we didn't have the

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,120
latest

264
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
technology at hand

265
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,320
um we used to uh use this

266
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,560
run-of-the-mill linux distros

267
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,880
for experiment for experimentation for

268
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,279
actually learning uh any kind of flavor

269
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,160
of linux and this was uh

270
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
this was usually distributed to some you

271
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
know computers designs and computer

272
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,360
magazines magazines that were

273
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,480
i think

274
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,720
they were monthly issues where they

275
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
bundle this

276
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,040
this software and some cd-roms and dvd

277
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,640
dvds are at the ladder stage

278
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,560
and we

279
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,600
we usually

280
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,399
move stuff around using

281
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,480
cds and floppy drives if you remember

282
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,920
those

283
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
now

284
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,760
we can leverage uh

285
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,440
a lot of

286
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,320
um a lot of technological

287
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,800
um

288
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,680
you know um

289
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
capabilities in order to

290
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
learn

291
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
and to uh

292
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,440
train inside to learn cyber security and

293
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
to train in cyber security

294
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
in school you have access to complex

295
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
in-depth teaching

296
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,519
to

297
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,279
at various levels

298
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,279
uh there are high schools in romania

299
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,240
that are

300
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,320
actively teaching topics on cyber

301
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,160
security to their students

302
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
there are great universities across the

303
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,120
country

304
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,560
with um

305
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,839
in-depth

306
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,440
masters degrees

307
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,680
programs for in cyber security and even

308
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,399
phds uh you have national and

309
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,160
international competitions such as

310
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,279
defcon

311
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,920
uh or unbreakable remaining

312
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,600
uh and you have a a large amount of

313
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,320
resources ranging from introductory

314
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
stuff to very detailed in-depth

315
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,760
references on a specific topic

316
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,640
right

317
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,160
uh so

318
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,240
you you can access them on various

319
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,079
devices on across different

320
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,279
architectures

321
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,440
this was unheard of back in the 90s you

322
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,240
know

323
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,600
x86 was the go-to thing you could do

324
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,920
you have lots of resources you have gits

325
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,160
right you have git yeah is there

326
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
something you don't know and you need to

327
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,399
know

328
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,839
go to a git

329
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,800
uh you have uh gigabit per second

330
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
capabilities communication capabilities

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,680
and i cannot stress this enough this is

332
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,880
probably one of the most important

333
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
important

334
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,680
advances in uh you know in

335
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,560
knowledge development in the past maybe

336
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,079
two decades

337
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,839
having a reliable access and fast access

338
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,760
to resources

339
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
means that you get to learn more stuff

340
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,160
quickly

341
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,720
so as you can see

342
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,079
there are

343
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,320
tons of ways we can do this better we

344
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,680
can we can push learning and and

345
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,720
training

346
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,200
using what's available now

347
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,399
um

348
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,600
now

349
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,079
let's go back a bit to to

350
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,240
security operations and

351
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,839
our focus on uh on setups

352
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,600
uh

353
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,639
cyclops uh it's just a mixed bunch

354
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,079
of uh

355
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,720
uh you know processes and knowledge and

356
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,680
tools

357
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,480
between uh people working in uh i.t

358
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,519
security and uh operational things

359
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,639
uh

360
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,440
psychops is

361
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,399
in principle a way of

362
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,639
doing security of actually operating

363
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,720
security operation centers

364
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
and uh in order to have

365
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,560
uh like

366
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
a um

367
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,360
you know an um a very lucrative and a

368
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
very efficient cyclops team

369
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,320
uh you need to have people that are

370
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
capable to

371
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,079
interact with tools and processes in

372
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,120
order to have continuous monitoring of

373
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,959
you know overall security

374
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,800
to have some form of early detection

375
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
prioritization of response

376
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
and to

377
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,560
actually have

378
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,959
hands-on incident response capabilities

379
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,480
through threat hunting and even

380
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,839
forensics

381
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,360
and uh this is um

382
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,440
this is actually enabled by tutoring and

383
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,160
continuous learning

384
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
so suck-ups it's fundamental to having

385
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,440
response detection and response

386
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,279
capabilities to all sorts of cyber

387
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,360
threats soviet security threats

388
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,440
and

389
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,920
going back to what the fundamental what

390
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,079
the basics

391
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,560
what the base for uh for this for for

392
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
for gaining this capability is

393
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
uh we have

394
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,800
tutoring and continuous learning

395
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,120
and our approach to this is of course

396
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,920
hands-on practice

397
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,040
so

398
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,120
what are the principal challenges in

399
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,720
actually learning and training um

400
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,880
when you go about the

401
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,399
self-thought

402
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
method of doing this

403
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,760
well

404
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
you have the sheer complexity and

405
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
diversity of documentation

406
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,000
if you are curious about learning how to

407
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,639
do one thing

408
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
uh let's say you're interesting in uh

409
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,959
you're interested in uh learning uh

410
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,360
about reverse engineering some windows

411
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,199
binaries

412
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,160
you can

413
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,920
access

414
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,120
several um

415
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,160
several resources

416
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,880
you have access to a myriad of authors

417
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
and publications and

418
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,839
even hands-on labs

419
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,639
videos podcasts

420
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,160
anything else

421
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
but the sheer complexity of the

422
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,600
information the sheer volume of

423
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
information

424
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,399
may actually be a

425
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,759
a challenge if you don't have a proper

426
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,360
training path

427
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,680
or an agenda right

428
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,720
so the lack of training of a clear

429
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,480
training path is

430
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,920
one of the principal challenges in

431
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,399
dangers

432
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,519
then

433
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,079
you have of course a lack of mapping the

434
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,800
knowledge gains right you get from from

435
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,600
uh

436
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,120
that complex and diverse uh curriculum

437
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,519
the curriculum to your business and

438
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,519
operational requirements because

439
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,000
you can be uh

440
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,800
you know um

441
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,279
you can choose to

442
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,040
to work in an

443
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,720
enterprise environment and where you

444
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,759
have to align your knowledge with some

445
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,519
business requirements and this is uh

446
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,519
this is coming in most cases

447
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,680
or uh you can uh

448
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
of course um

449
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,240
be

450
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,480
i don't know self-employed and work as a

451
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,360
freelancer but even in that context you

452
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
still have to

453
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
have a clear knowledge and a clear

454
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,920
alignment in scope with what are the

455
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,720
operational requirements in what you do

456
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,040
so uh the lack of mapping of these games

457
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,440
to your to the requirements of actually

458
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,240
working in cyber security operations is

459
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
one of the principal challenges when it

460
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,199
comes to actually learning new stuff uh

461
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,040
in order to work in a security operation

462
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
center for say

463
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,720
then you you have multiple professional

464
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,839
certifications and uh these are these

465
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,720
have curriculums that are overlapping

466
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,520
uh

467
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,919
there are overlapping knowledge areas

468
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,919
and uh for someone that is not

469
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,679
necessarily very well

470
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,640
trained

471
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
and very well documented it doesn't have

472
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,799
a very well documented knowledge in what

473
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
type of certification and what type of

474
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,039
program you should follow in order to

475
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,360
gain some uh what type of program you

476
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,640
should follow in order to gain a

477
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,400
specific certification it could be

478
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
cumbersome just to navigate to those and

479
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,400
i'm not bashing professional

480
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
professional certifications these are

481
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
these are incredibly useful

482
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,840
uh but

483
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,640
uh

484
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,120
in order to to to have someone

485
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,480
in order to guide someone through a

486
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
career path and you know as a milestone

487
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
have them uh access some sort of

488
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,600
training program followed by

489
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,760
certification if you were to start from

490
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,520
scratch from zero it will be

491
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,000
not necessarily impossible but it will

492
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,840
be a true challenge for someone to

493
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,000
choose the right certification

494
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,960
um

495
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
and this is uh

496
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,039
clearly aligned with a

497
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,840
lack of you know consistent

498
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
self-assessment methods

499
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,880
uh you gain knowledge but uh

500
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,080
you don't have a a very clear

501
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,360
way of

502
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,480
you know

503
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,120
pinpointing your knowledge to

504
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,840
to some sort of uh

505
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,160
milestone in your progress

506
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
um

507
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
and then you have multiple learning

508
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,400
platforms

509
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,960
uh there are several commercial

510
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
commercial grade platforms where you

511
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,000
could go about training

512
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,039
uh and then there's the open source

513
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,400
stuff and there's the community stuff

514
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,840
all of these

515
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,039
uh

516
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:53,919
add

517
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,120
to the challenge and complexity in being

518
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,000
a self-taught cyber security enthusiast

519
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,840
so what we want to do here is fix all

520
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,440
that

521
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,799
and um in order to gain

522
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,919
some capability uh and some visibility

523
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,840
in those challenges

524
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,840
um we are promoting cyberedu

525
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,160
which is a tool developed by a startup

526
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,080
in orangeform

527
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,480
and that startup is actually a spin-off

528
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
of one of our

529
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,919
traditional partners in cyber security

530
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,640
some great people we work closely with

531
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,520
in

532
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,240
some of our some of our most important

533
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,840
uh and endeavors in cyber security

534
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,879
but uh and they um they had this um

535
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,000
you know

536
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,640
back and forward with us on

537
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,120
what can be done in order to

538
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,080
uh

539
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,480
improve like in a very uh resilient and

540
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,960
very transparent way

541
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,760
the methods we use for training

542
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,120
for uh self-assessment for certification

543
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
for and for continuous learning

544
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,960
and uh because uh they have a lot of

545
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
experience in organizing uh capture the

546
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,039
flag competitions

547
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,159
um

548
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,159
they um

549
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,520
developed

550
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
uh cyberhead

551
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,080
uh

552
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,960
and what cyberhead is is an online

553
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,360
platform that is available for free to

554
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,440
anyone that wants to register on

555
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,440
cyberedu.raw

556
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,679
it is an environment of specially

557
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,159
crafted cyber range as a service

558
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,880
technologies that allows

559
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,039
its users to interact with um

560
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,400
hands-on

561
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,320
laboratories and hands-on exercises on a

562
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,600
very diverse range of cyber security

563
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,360
related topics

564
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,400
um

565
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,080
so

566
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,520
what this uh actually enables for

567
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,280
training security ops

568
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
like psychops

569
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,760
is that

570
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,880
uh

571
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,440
it can be used as a tool

572
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,320
for

573
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,640
understanding the fundamental skills

574
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,280
required for a specific job

575
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,799
and then

576
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,000
accessing

577
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,080
real life scenarios real life exercises

578
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,039
to of course

579
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,520
online simulation

580
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,360
on those specific skills

581
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,120
and you know uh

582
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,440
in an end cycle type of way

583
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
measure uh the achievements and the

584
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,640
performance and self-evaluate so this is

585
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,039
a continuous learning platform that is

586
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,720
specifically targeted towards developing

587
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,200
and enabling and developing

588
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
uh operational skills

589
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,320
in cyber security

590
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,720
cyberhead is available for individual

591
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,600
users users uh as i said before you know

592
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,520
uh for free

593
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,080
uh you get to register on the platform

594
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,159
and then you have immediately you have

595
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,640
access to some

596
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,480
150 plus

597
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
cdf challenges

598
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,360
that have been uh written and tested by

599
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,240
some of the the leading experts and

600
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,080
cyber security enthusiasts

601
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,799
that are mainly involved in organizing

602
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,799
uh

603
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,400
large-scale cdfs across

604
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,159
across the world including the dctf

605
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,720
but for companies and for universities

606
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,919
there's a specific and a special site uh

607
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,039
a a special um

608
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,679
you know um

609
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,840
feature set

610
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,720
that

611
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,080
enables

612
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,720
cyber range as a service like uh

613
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,480
functionalities for training red and

614
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,760
blue teams

615
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,000
uh ctf as a service

616
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,120
so you can uh actually have access to a

617
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,200
custom-made tailor-made ctr for your

618
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
company

619
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,320
um in your uh um

620
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,530
i don't know um

621
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,440
[Music]

622
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,400
for your it or ot needs like tailored

623
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,720
for your specific business vertical

624
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,520
uh access to secure coding labs

625
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,480
um

626
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,280
and um in uh

627
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,760
probably the most important part of this

628
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,600
talent screening for your hr departments

629
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
so you have access to this tool you can

630
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,120
gain access to this field to this

631
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,320
service

632
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,760
uh where your uh uh hr and technical

633
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,360
departments can see like a visual a

634
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,159
visual representation of of of the skill

635
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,919
set mapping uh

636
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,720
of candidates to some operational

637
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,880
positions to

638
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,650
your

639
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,440
[Music]

640
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,000
needs and to your

641
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,720
business or op requirements

642
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,000
and then for universities

643
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,720
you have access to hands-on content

644
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,760
uh these are exercises and challenges

645
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,799
that are

646
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,679
mapped

647
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,919
or at least they can be mapped

648
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,600
to the

649
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,840
university curriculum

650
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,000
so we can use cyber redo as your own

651
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,240
go-to online uh

652
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,279
laboratory for um

653
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,200
you know provisioning

654
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,320
um

655
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,039
exercises uh hands-on labs through your

656
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,120
cybersecurity curriculum

657
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,400
um

658
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,720
you have you gain an increased status

659
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
engagement because this is true

660
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
gamification of knowledge so it is going

661
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,200
to be definitely more engaging and more

662
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
a more fun way for your for your

663
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,240
students to interact with uh with the

664
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,440
knowledge gain

665
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,320
uh

666
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,840
in this

667
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,120
in a competition like environment

668
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,840
and of course you get to bridge the gap

669
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,480
between theory and practice and i cannot

670
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,600
stress this enough this is probably the

671
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,919
most important

672
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,559
route to

673
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,039
actually gaining

674
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,080
knowledge

675
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,799
on

676
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,760
uh practical matters in cyber security

677
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
and cyber radio has the capability to

678
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,720
host exams

679
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
and competitions internal competitions

680
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,480
in universities

681
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,080
um

682
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,480
this is achieved through uh

683
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,200
uh in stages to uh

684
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
some category of tools

685
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,159
first you have online and on demand

686
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,799
labs curated by uh

687
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,799
and content curated by experts by other

688
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,360
by subject matter experts collaborating

689
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,400
with uh with cyber revenue uh in order

690
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,159
to provision this this types of uh

691
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,760
content but this can be extended to uh

692
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
to the universities to the prophet to

693
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,200
the professors in

694
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
universities in order to have their own

695
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
content hosted there

696
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
um

697

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,600
uh we uh we are envisioning and we are

715
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,360
actually targeting actually actively

716
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,480
targeting some sort of certification

717
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,279
that

718
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,600
um maybe we'll get we will gain some

719
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,790
some you know um

720
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,320
[Music]

721
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,600
type of

722

um

724
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,320
while using cyborg

725
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,400
um there's just a few screenshots of the

726
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,440
dashboards i'm i'm hopeful that uh some

727
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,400
of you

728
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,320
uh those that are not uh do not have a

729
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,600
registered account on cyberalready will

730
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,240
will register and get you interact with

731
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,399
some of the challenges there

732
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,919
um you

733
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,120
you have access to challenges across

734
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
various levels of difficulty

735
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,159
and

736
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,399
across various topics uh you can uh see

737

competitions that are actually uh hosted

739
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,279
either through cyberedu on or some other

740
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,640
platforms

741
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
but uh

742
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,720
this is a very uh

743
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,360
a very useful way of

744
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,559
having

745
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,360
access to a calendar for ctf

746
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,960
competitions and tracking your progress

747
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,919
there

748
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,799
and

749
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,880
one of the most important assets that

750
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,640
cyberalready offers to companies to

751
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,600
business

752
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,360
businesses is that

753
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,640
it has the ability to map

754
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,279
uh the challenges

755
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,080
uh in in the platform

756
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,960
to

757
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,080
uh

758
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,840
some of the skills

759
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
that can be gained

760
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,919
gained in order to uh respond to uh

761
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,240
specific requirements of different

762
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,080
frameworks that are

763
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,880
uh

764
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,039
actively being used

765
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:31,840
in

766
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,640
many businesses um all over the world

767
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,880
such as mighty attack

768
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,200
so you get to train here

769
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,440
uh either on a

770
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,399
very

771
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,360
clear topic very very as a clear path in

772
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,679
one topic let's say you are you're

773
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,799
interested in uh

774
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,000
you know gaining some type of knowledge

775
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,520
in

776
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,279
command and control

777
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,240
you can uh follow the uh

778
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
you can follow the exercise you can

779
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,320
actually solve the exercises in that

780
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,120
column and you can uh follow the uh

781
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,360
your progress in an individual report

782
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,200
type of uh

783
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,320
type of way

784
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,440
or uh

785
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,039
you know um

786
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,279
you can map your knowledge and your

787
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,039
actual knowledge gains through ospo the

788
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,679
web security framework that are that is

789
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,279
widely used

790
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,000
by companies hosting uh

791
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,480
all types of web applications or web

792
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,760
services

793
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,840
this is uh this mapping

794
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,679
is

795
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,640
one way of uh just one of the ways that

796
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,960
uh cyberedu allows you to to reach

797
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
cyberedu allows you to monitor your

798
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,320
progress

799
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,200
but you have access to an individual

800
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,880
performance report

801
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,520
that is continuously updating

802
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,200
as you

803
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,159
interact and solve the challenges

804
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,080
that you have access to

805
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,760
and for businesses and for universities

806
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,120
you

807
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,240
can

808
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,120
gain access to a more comprehensive

809
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,919
overall training report and progress

810
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,200
report

811
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,240
across your employees or your students

812
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,200
so

813
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,159
this is cyber edu i um

814
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,520
i uh i cannot uh you know um

815
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,559
i cannot stress uh uh uh enough the

816
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,399
importance of having uh uh this uh to

817
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,159
having access to this type of tool and

818
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,799
this type of knowledge um

819
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,520
because cyber you can

820
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,159
you know bridge the gap between

821
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,000
um

822
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,520
your uh

823
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,120
goals of achieving like of gaining

824
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,080
knowledge in cyber security and

825
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,399
all the challenges

826
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,559
in your path

827
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,200
in doing so

828
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,360
unbreakable romania is

829
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,799
a competition

830
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,279
that is actually using cyber editor as a

831
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,880
platform

832
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,840
uh so this is a first implementation

833
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,960
of cyber radio in a

834
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,720
ctf context

835
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,600
is an online ctf competition targeting

836
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,240
high school and university students

837
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,200
uh but it does have a category for

838
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,880
participle for for people wanting to

are taught by professional experts and

844
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,440
academic partners in cyber security

845
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,279
we have a national scoreboard that is

846
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,240
available uh on uh on the website on

847
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,919

unbreakable uh is rolling out its second

853
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,200
season the autumn winter season for 2021

and are hosted by subject matter experts

871
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,600
in these key areas

872
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,559
um

873
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,240
we kicked off unbreakable in um with a

874
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,080
pilot event

875
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,960
in

876
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,240
late 2020 if i remember correctly

877
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,200
and we were overwhelmed by the

878
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,480
interest from the participants and

879
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,399
all the positive feedback we received on

880
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,039
this competition alone so we extended

881
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,039
this we have our first season in spring

882
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,039
summer if i remember correctly it was in

883
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,519
april mid-april to to may

884
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,480
uh where we kicked off a boot camp uh

885
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,720
with webinars on uh threat intel and

886
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,640
networking tools and

887
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
introduction to cryptography and web

888
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,480
security and all this uh very

889
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,679
interesting uh topics and then

890
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,720
we

891
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
we had a competition happening in one

892
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,399
weekend so it was a

893
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,240
48 hour ctf

894
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,360
um

895
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,640
with uh 850 registered participants

896
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,399
through the boot camps but nearly uh

897
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,799
nearly 900 actual participants in the

898
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,640
ctf

899
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,880
uh more than half of the participants

900
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,279
were students in universities but we did

901
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,240
have some nearly 30 percent

902
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,880
participation from high school

903
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,399
uh peoples

904
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,440
and

905
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,600
uh some uh

906
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,880
20

907
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,120
uh participated just for fun

908
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,600
uh we had the first weekend the first

909
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,399
flag in 30 seconds

910
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,199
and

911
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,800
there will there were nearly 12 000

912
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,159
attempts

913
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,960
at solving the exercises with nearly 4

914
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,320
000 uh successful attempts

915
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,960
all the solves were

916
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,599
reached after 28 hours

917
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,480
and

918
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,879
this is a dashboard for for uh just for

919
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,320
the first season

920
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,719
and we are now uh currently in the

921
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,399
second season and across us are at least

922
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,159
as good as they were in the first season

923
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,839
but in most areas they are actually

924
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,040
better

925
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
we are hoping that unbreakable will

926
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
become a

927
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,960
uh will that will uh

928
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,399
become a um you know like uh this

929
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,760
uh go-to type of event in cyber security

930
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,159
in romania and it will be a reference

931
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,839
for uh

932
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,720
most universities and most high schools

933
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,880
uh that want to

934
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,000
explore

935
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,359
um

936
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,400
you know

937
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,440
the the capabilities of having

938
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,359
a hands-on

939
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,720
um

940
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,640
hands-on competition for their students

941
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,200
and for their people

942
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,040
and we are

943
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,960
very much looking forward sharing with

944
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,200
you the results of the season two of

945
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,359
unbreakable or actually season three

946
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,920
maybe next year at deathcam

947
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,680
um

948
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,400
and i'm going to move to the

949
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,359
latter

950
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,000
part of my presentation uh hopefully i

951
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,560
didn't board you too much with this

952
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,320
um

953
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,280
this is

954
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,000
the the education sock or the edgy sock

955
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,839
as we very unamusing and very um

956
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:48,720
you know

957
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,200
not that great sounding um

958
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,240
are calling this project of ours um this

959
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,839
is the

960
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,839
the culmination of

961
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,920
our efforts to bring

962
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,040
together

963
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,920
uh

964
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,440
a great

965
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,000
set of tools for uh cyber security

966
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,680
education and training

967
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,560
uh

968
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,160
lots of knowledge

969
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,800
from the private sector and great

970
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,040
collaboration with universities and the

971
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,240
public sector

972
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,200
uh we want to get uh we want to bring

973
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,640
this type of interaction between uh

974
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,440
these type of types of entities

975
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
under one roof

976
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,280
so what we are proposing is piloting

977
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,440
some regional and sectoral security

978
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,839
operations centers that are going to be

979
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,000
built and operated within romanian

980
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,280
universities

981
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,160
and are going to offer their services to

982
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,599
smes to small and medium enterprises

983
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,160
uh with a uh

984
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,720
um and a very uh heavy um

985
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,040
you know um

986
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,680
profiling of the

987
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,520
specific needs

988
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,400
of

989
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,280
uh

990
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,839
the business verticals and the regional

991
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,480
context in which they operate

992
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,880
in order to do this we partnered up with

993
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,000
uh some of

994
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
the most important universities in

995
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,440
romania and i

996
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,240
thank them for for their

997
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,920
collaboration

998
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,760
and we want to

999
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
develop what we want to

1000
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,520
develop and maintain the security

1001
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,079
operation centers together with our

1002
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,000
partners

1003
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,240
startups in cyber security and our

1004
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,800
corporate partners

1005
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,000
we want to have these socs

1006
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,400
operating on a three-prong approach

1007
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,119
uh in in principle we want to have a

1008
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,560
learn as you work

1009
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,160
approach to

1010
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,359
to to

1011
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,280
operating these services

1012
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,160
because the actually secops that are

1013
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
going to work in these socks

1014
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,920
are student

1015
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,200
are students in these universities

1016
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,440
uh we want to align the training and

1017
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,599
practice they are going to gain in this

1018
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,119
in these security operation centers with

1019
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,040
their academic curriculum

1020
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,839
and of course have an alignment between

1021
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,440
the certification and performance

1022
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,880
evaluation with their academic

1023
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,520
evaluations

1024
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,640
and then we want to reuse it

1025
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,760
this means that we need to adapt in the

1026
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,480
south eastern part of romania through

1027
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,640
collaboration with one university in

1028
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,119
constanza we are going to target

1029
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,000
uh

1030
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,839
some

1031
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,400
some companies in the uh hospital

1032
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,320
so we want to have the soc in the

1033
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,880
university like operated by students

1034
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,839
um you know three um

1035
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,040
on a three level uh hierarchy uh

1036
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,000
approach and we want to have these socs

1037
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,839
actually interact and communicate with

1038
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,359
other socs

1039
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,720
with various threats intelligence

1040
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
sources that we can provide that our

1041
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,320
partners can provide

1042
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,280
and of course with national authorities

1043
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,480
uh such as the the nsc and uh

1044
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,400
because you know threat intelligence

1045
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,520
sharing is um

1046
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,880
probably the most important activity you

1047
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,040
get to do you know at an operational

1048
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,079
level in soc

1049
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,160
our approach to mapping

1050
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,680
some of the components to the

1051
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,520
technologies that are your usual

1052
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,240
suspects usually required in soc

1053
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,079
um is uh is presented here on this slide

1054
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,800
so we want to use tools such as elastic

1055
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,400
security and um the hiven cortex for the

1056
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,200
cm and so our

1057
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,520
capabilities we want to use cyber radio

1058
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,200
for continuous learning and training in

1059
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
in the socs

1060
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,560
and um use

1061
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,800
orange temp that's treadmill exposures

1062
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,280
and management platform uh this is this

1063
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,920
is our custom build exposures management

1064
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,440
exposures assessment and management

1065
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,079
platform for all uh vulnerability

1066
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,200
assessment related activities and

1067
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,079
uh use and reuse

1068
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,119
um

1069
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,200
widely available open source and

1070
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,760
free software such as you know the

1071
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,720
diverse

1072
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,520
various honeypots we can uh

1073
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,240
we can deploy in the sock or mis or

1074
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,640
cuckoo for sandboxes

1075
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,800
this approach of ours is definitely

1076
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,599
going to evolve over time and i'm really

1077
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,160
looking forward to share some um you

1078
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,000
know some um

1079
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,119
uh maybe day two or day three results

1080
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,359
after the first uh the

1081
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,240
pilot

1082
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,160
of our soc maybe next year of death camp

1083
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,359
uh until then and this is my final slide

1084
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,359
i promise then we are going to have some

1085
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,880
a few minutes set aside for for q a

1086
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,160
um

1087
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,400
this is a plug to some of the things

1088
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,520
that

1089
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,599
we are doing at orange in order to

1090
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,560
improve

1091
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,760
um

1092
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,560
our

1093
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,800
capabilities in offering great cyber

1094
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,319
security services and uh in order to

1095
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,960
improve the cyber security awareness

1096
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,599
uh the overall cyber security uh

1097
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,119
awareness

1098
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,119
uh through our business partners

1099
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,440
partners and our academic partners

1100
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,599
that allows us to research

1101
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,079
and develop in a 5g infrastructure

1102
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,599
services and applications so this is

1103
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,119
where we uh

1104
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,160
worked on this just launched yesterday

1105
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,000
and it is available for download for

1106
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,800
free on threadmap.law and on the orange

1107
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,720
business services website

1108
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,800
this is a very nice document and uh it's

1109
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,640
our fourth edition so this is our fourth

1110
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,079
or fourth year um you can uh

1111
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,880
see some of the

1112
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,400
insights

1113
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,119
we um we gained from

1114
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,960
you know monitoring the trend the threat

1115
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,359
landscape tutorial customers

1116
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,720
um

1117
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,599
we are heavily involved in uh research

1118
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,240
projects in uh frameworks such as

1119
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,480
horizon 2020

1120
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,640
uh in various on various topics on

1121
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,440
critical infrastructure and the 5gbp

1122
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,800
um series of projects and then um

1123
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,880
one of some very interesting ones such

1124
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,400
as unicore

1125
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,079
and um

1126
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,200
one of the programs that i'm

1127
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,880
especially of course

1128
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,680
to not just uh etti students not just

1129
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,800
students from the electronic and

1130
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,880
telecommunication information

1131
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,960
um the faculty

1132
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,680
in

1133
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,040
polytechnica and bucharest but across i

1134
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,520
guess is six universities

1135
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,240
across romania and we are working hard

1136
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,880
on extending oep to even more

1137
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,640
universities and even more faculties

1138
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,000
there

1139
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,640
this is all on my part thank you i

1140
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,960
really hope i didn't bore you uh to

1141
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,440
death with my uh slides

1142
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,400
um

1143
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
this was an interesting pair and and

1144
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,119
present because some of the things that

1145
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,440
we uh that i mentioned here in these

1146
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,880
slides are uh actually uh

1147
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,839
uh we are very early in in our pipeline

1148
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,720
when it comes to uh actually developing

1149
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,680
and piloting these things such as the um

1150
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,440
educational soc

1151
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,760
so i really really hope that by next

1152
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,400
year i will be able to get back to you

1153
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,040
with some good news this and i guess so

1154
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,319
much

1155
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,240
sorry sorry go ahead i didn't want a

1156
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,520
button

1157
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,960
oh i just wanted to stress that uh we

1158
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,359
can now have maybe a few minutes for uh

1159
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,680
for q and a's if there are any queues of

1160
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,359
course

1161
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,520
thank you so much ewan this has been so

1162
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,760
comprehensive this is just absolutely

1163
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,720
unbelievable to see how fast cyberedu

1164
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,560
has grown and how many things have

1165
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,400
happened in the past year to me that's

1166
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,880
been amazing i remember when it launched

1167
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,119
i remember it feels like

1168
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,680
many years ago although it was only like

1169
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
last year

1170
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,359
from the day that it was launched it is

1171
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,880
amazing to see

1172
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,040
the steps the practical and very

1173
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,680
impactful steps that you're taking to

1174
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
actually making a difference in how

1175
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,240
cyber security education happens on a

1176
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,800
younger and younger age so we can get

1177
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,480
people invested in the industry and help

1178
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,960
cultivate their talents help amplify

1179
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,119
them and help them find their way

1180
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,680
because it is true that young people

1181
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,960
today live in a world full of

1182
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,640
possibilities but that doesn't make it

1183
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,240
any easier just like you mentioned to

1184
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,640
pick and choose what you do next what

1185
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,560
your next project is what you're going

1186
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,400
to learn next that is such a big

1187
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,319
challenge and just helping them on their

1188
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,040
path to find clarity and focus and

1189
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,440
develop those skills i think is so so

1190
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,680
important uh and i just love how

1191
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,920
everything has developed and i'm really

1192
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,960
looking forward to see how these uh edu

1193
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,040
socks um

1194
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,520
evolve and how to grow so i just have

1195
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,440
like we have time for only one question

1196
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,960
unfortunately uh but i wanted to ask

1197
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,560
what are what are

1198
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,720
what other abilities um do students and

1199
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,720
and uh you know of all ages or

1200
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,200
should they develop to help them on

1201
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,359
their way you know besides tech skills

1202
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,599
to help them on their way to becoming

1203
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,160
specialists to becoming founders to

1204
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,400
becoming you know entrepreneurs or

1205
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,599
whatever they choose to do with their uh

1206
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,359
know-how experience passion and

1207
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,280
curiosity

1208
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,800
well um that's

1209
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
that is actually a great question and i

1210
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,119
i i realized that i should have led with

1211
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,119
that actually when i started discussing

1212
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,119
subreddit as a whole as a concept

1213
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,480
um there is

1214
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,599
one

1215
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,440
principal uh area of focus at least uh

1216
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,240
from my perspective when it comes to

1217
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,319
um you know

1218
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,760
actually uh putting these capabilities

1219
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,960
to use

1220
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,000
um like in a lucrative way for someone

1221
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,599
that is interesting is interested in

1222
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,520
cyber security and that is sheer

1223
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,440
curiosity

1224
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,640
uh i know it may sound a bit off like

1225
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,079
yeah you know you got to be curious

1226
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,680
about things now you really have to be

1227
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,160
curious about things you really have to

1228
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,800
ask yourself yourselves

1229
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,800
uh not um not necessarily how do you go

1230
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,839
about doing that but mostly

1231
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,520
why do you have to go about doing that

1232
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,680
you have to challenge the status quo if

1233
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,359
something uh

1234
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,319
is there if something if exists you have

1235
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,520
to challenge it you have to

1236
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,400
you know have your uh uh

1237
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,960
real wheels spinning and you have to uh

1238
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,839
set your creativity uh on a very high

1239
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,200
roll and uh in high gear in order to try

1240
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,200
to change as much as possible on what is

1241
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,280
uh what actually is the norm or or what

1242
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,680
tends to become department and uh i

1243
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,040
think that this is

1244
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,319
one of the most

1245
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,920
practical uh way of um

1246
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,599
gaining progress

1247
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,319
uh in cyber security

1248
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,319
i totally agree critical thinking and

1249
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,480
systems thinking those are two abilities

1250
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,119
that are aren't only helpful in your

1251
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,760
let's say professional where you

1252
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,599
and the way that you apply your skills

1253
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,119
and knowledge in the professional kind

1254
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,599
of field but they're also great

1255
