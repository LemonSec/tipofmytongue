exploiter

42

security professionals to perform pen

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,920
testing engagements much

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
faster and more effective

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,598

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,319

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,480
souls inside the inside the the

102
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
conference and the all the amazing

103
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,959
activities happening here tell us about

104
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,759
cyberedu and how did the how did you get

105
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,000
to build this

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,199
hello yes uh probably

107
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,840
i must start by telling that cyberedu

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,360
started after death campaign 2019

109
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
actually after we closed the

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
anniversary edition some of the

111
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,720
participants told us oh we need we want

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
to see the challenges and the labs that

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,800
were given in the hacking village

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
because they wanted to learn more and

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
solve them and try to

116
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,120
solve them

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,919
in order to see if they can because

118
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
during death camp it's a lot of pressure

119
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
and actually this is how it all started

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,240
we wanted to first we wanted to create

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
an environment for hosting labs online

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,720
so

123
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,639
we created um cyberedu as the platform

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,680
for

125
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
hosting

126
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,240
ctfs and labs but

127
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,680
in a short time it became more as a

128
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
learning tool because we started to also

129
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,039
add

130
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,240
entry entry-level labs that could uh

131
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,680
support an individual in their learning

132
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
uh path towards cyber security because

133
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
we are

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
active believers that cyber security is

135
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,120
best learned by doing so

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
we we we cover this hands-on side of

137
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,039
cyber which is a very challenging part

138
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,600
but we are happy to take on and

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
actually we are really happy to see that

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,919
all hacking village this year is

141
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,639
happening on on cyberedu and it's really

142
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,120
amazing

143
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,759
tell us more in general

144
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,160
about what's happening in cyber red

145
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
right

146
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,080
i know you have quite a lot of users

147
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
already on the platform tell us a bit

148
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,880
about how the product is growing

149
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
yes

150
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,600
we actually

151
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,639
are almost to 8 000 users registered

152
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,560
users

153
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
it's growing really good we have over

154
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,639
200 labs available on different um

155
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
knowledge levels and also on different

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,360
topics related to cyber security and

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,000
currently we are working with lots of

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
universities to

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
bring cyberedu to the academic

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,479
environment because for

161
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,440
for academias it helps bridge the

162
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,280
theoretical information towards the

163
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,520
practice because in cyber it's really

164
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,919
important to also practice to have a

165
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,960
space to to apply what you've learned at

166
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,759
the university and we have

167
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,000
we started to work with

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,160
some universities and we are still

169
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
developing this this part and it's

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,639
really great

171
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,280
wonderful so uh it's 8 000 people who

172
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,919
are doing uh exercises in there but you

173
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,919
mentioned 200 uh workshops right labs

174
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
yes

175
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,440
i i mean you're providing the platform

176
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,199
but the platform does not live on and is

177
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,520
not actually useful without the content

178
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,000
and the educational

179
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,759
yes yes exactly we are regularly adding

180
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,000
new content in order to keep the users

181
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
engaged we are also organizing different

182
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
competitions

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
also to keep the the competitive spirit

184
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
alive and to motivate all the users to

185
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,520
to engage and to solve exercise and this

186
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,160
way they can also develop their skills

187
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
in order to reach the next level of

188
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,879
mastery in cyber security because on

189
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,680
cyberaudio you can start

190
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
fresh with beginners labs and then you

191
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
can move forward towards a professional

192
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,520
and

193
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,879
you as cyber edu you are

194
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,199
obviously building the platform are you

195
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,160
also creating all the content

196
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
currently we are yes we are building the

197
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,639
platform and we are also creating the

198
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,919
content not all of the content but most

199
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,879
of it because we also have um

scenarios inspired from real life in

210
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,560
order to challenge the

211
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,600

services around cyber security

230
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
in order to automate

who is generating security logs

248
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,920
we are seeing a lot of traction with

249
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,839
managed security providers kind of

250
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,600

they are taking care of the security of

252
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,040
their own customers and uh there is a

253
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,079
place where all the alerts are coming

254
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:30,959
and

255
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,200

307
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
i know a part of the startups that we

308
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,720
are uh talking to today uh have started

309
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,120
building products after delivering

310
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,279
services basically cyber security

311
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,000
services for uh many types of customers

312
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
and uh my guess is

313
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,800
that was a learning point for you right

314
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,440
before going into product

315
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,800
yeah indeed this is our story we

316
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,680
we

317
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,800
we had several years of service

318
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,000
delivery in cyber security areas in the

319
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
idea infrastructure i'm also networking

320
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,079
guy

321
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,800
my start of my career

322
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,000
and

323
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,120
this was the foundation for our

324
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,800
knowledge in applying this know-how uh

325
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,680
mixing it with uh big data

326
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
and developing around big data in that

327
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,279
data aggregation skills and with data

328
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,040
scientists and

329
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,880
we feel that we can

330
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,560
uh yeah bring

331
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,839

subject matter that is like cyber

333
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,199
security um and yet developing skills

334
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,519
which which is mandatory to develop a

335
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,360

a novel approach in uh detecting uh

345
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,760
browser browser exploits it was

346
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
first presented there's a concept at

347
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,639
death camp in 2016.

348
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,839
later it

349
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,839
it was

350
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
it grown into into a startup

351
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,760
now delivering uh professional services

352
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,680
uh basically to tell you a little bit

353
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,720
about what the canes is doing

354
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,399
um as you as you mentioned uh as you saw

355
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,240
in the in the past years there was a

356
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,079
plethora of browser exploits mostly in

357
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,959
chrome or safari browsers which were

358
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,360
mainly disclosed by a google threat

359
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
analysis group

360
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,279
they use for their

361
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,240
for their work and the research uh a

362
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
tool that is uh quite similar to the kns

363
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,399
the only difference is that the kns is

364
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,560
addressing to the to the great public

365
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,440
while

366
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,839
google google's tool is only

367
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,639
internal and is designed for research

368
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
purposes only

369
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,199
um this means in in a real situation

370
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,040
that um victims of browser exploits and

371
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,079
there are a lot of lots of victims

372
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,240
never actually know they had they had

373
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
been compromised

374
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,839
but their

375
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
their problem

376
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,040
was part of research conducted by uh

377
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,240
by google to to discover threat actors

378
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
and their their methods we at the canals

379
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,000
do

380
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
quite the same thing but the the

381
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,440
difference is that we allow the users to

382
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,279
to know if

383
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,839
they are visiting websites that will

384
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,639
might

385
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,440
attack their devices

386
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,720
we are

387
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,399
ready to launch now version 2 0

388
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,800
which will also give

389
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,959
detection for

390
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,360
mobile devices

391
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,959
until now we

392
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,759
were focused only on most on

393
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,959
desktop devices but uh

394
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,279
with version two zero we

395
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,199
improved a lot our mobile detection

396
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,720
capabilities and of course a lot of new

397
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,600
and interesting features

398
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,320
can you tell us a bit andre uh how how

399
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,959
this road has been for you so in 2016

400
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,279
you first presented the death camp right

401
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,839
uh the concept that uh that's at the

402
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,440
basis of the kenya's uh how has it been

403
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,680
to move into delivering products and

404
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,440
being an entrepreneur

405
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
from from what you were doing before as

406
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,160
a researcher well uh to be honest with

407
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
you i wanted to quit like a million

408
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,480
times

409
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,680
but

410
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
every time i was telling myself you got

411
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,880
this far you cannot stop now you must go

412
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,680
all the way and basically

413
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,280
um believing in in my product

414
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,959
and envisioning

415
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,359
how to better it and make it more

416
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,520
adapted to the to the

417
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,280
market needs uh i managed to

418
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,599
transform a proof of concept code that

419
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,480
was

420
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,599
research research purposes only into a

421
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,160
service that is accessible to the to the

422
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,799
broad public

423
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,440
and

424
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,280
yeah i wanted to to also mention that

425
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,200
my my service doesn't address a specific

426
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,760
market segment it's addressing to almost

427
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,640
everybody as everybody might be a victim

428
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,760
of browser exploits as we all you are

429
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,840
using browsers and out of accident or by

430
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,720
being target targeted by somebody

431
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,120
we might have our devices compromised

432
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,080
and never knowing this

433
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,120
yeah so as the education level rises

434
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,840
right about these threats uh the usage

435
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,520
for your product should should rise as

436
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,000
well yes yes exactly

437
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,360
thank you andrei um i'll move on to to

438
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,799
our my colleague

439
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,679
it's uh it's no secret that asset orange

440
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,360
romania have been working with these

441
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,760
amazing startups but they were part of

442
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,320
orange fab a program that we are running

443
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
so as to facilitate and to better

444
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,320
understand how we as a corporation can

445
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,320
work with startups uh iwan is here as a

446
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
as the cyber security expert inside

447
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,360
orange romania who basically has

448
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,080
actually been doing a lot of work with

449
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,720
with the entrepreneurs in this panel uh

450
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
so i invited him because i think uh it's

451
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,679
useful to share also uh uh the

452
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
perspective of people who are buying

453
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,640
services and products from startups uh

454
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,039
and maybe to to give an insight on how

455
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,600
how we are thinking juan

456
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,840
how is it to work with startups uh

457
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,919
besides maybe in comparison with other

458
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,120
established companies right

459
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,720
um hello uh thank you monica

460
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,679
it is interesting just to say the least

461
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,400
um in a sense that

462
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,240
we don't necessarily go about doing

463
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,200
business

464
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,360
uh you know very uh

465
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,480
or

466
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,000
in a specific framework

467
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,200
we have uh such liberties and we have

468
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
such um

469
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,480
flexibility that allows us to go

470
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,039
a bit beyond an mvp or a proof of

471
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,080
concept

472
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,360
and ask

473
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,559
okay how can we push this further i mean

474
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,400
for for instance uh um with uh

475
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
i think that

476
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,679
with each of the great people

477
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,520
present here in this panel

478
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,039
we went from

479
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,760
an

480
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,039
initial um original idea

481
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,080
uh that of course

482
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,640
went on to become became a product and

483
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,960
used that idea and those functionalities

484
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,360
to extend or expand the reach of the

485
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,000
product the features of the project of

486
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,360
the product or

487
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,159
even the the integration the the actual

488
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,840
implementation of that program of that

489
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,039
product

490
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,480
and further on

491
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,679
we did our best to actually uh road test

492
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,360
each of these products inside orange

493
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,640
uh before or uh in most cases in

494
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,600
parallel to going to the market

495
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,320
so this was interesting as well uh this

496
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,400
is where you can draw a very conclusive

497
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,880
line between uh working uh in a um

498
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,760
well

499
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
somewhat regulated and consistent

500
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,600
framework with the large enterprises and

501
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,760
large companies where pretty much

502
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,720
everything

503
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,240
or everything i mean most of the

504
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,320
you know interactions and developments

505
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
related to products and services should

506
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,720
flow in a very uh you know productive

507
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,520
way

508
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
predictable way

509
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,440
as opposed to working with startups with

510
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,000
these amazing startups and

511
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,520
uh being part of the actual development

512
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,879
uh phase of the product

513
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,520
i love the we we have an inside joke

514
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,600

most cases with these startups

523
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,600
present here

524
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,760

the

531
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,360
the conclusion of it all

532
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,280
but in particular we are um i am

533
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,679
actually working with uh

534
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,679
with some of the startups here to uh

535
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,919
develop new products and

536
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,440
new technologies

537
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,559
uh aside from the ones that are actually

538
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,559
part of the portfolio or

539
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,480
are actually accelerated for each fund

540
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,720
good thank you adrian i know you have

541
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,880
quite a quite a big team

542
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,080
tell us a bit about uh the journey right

543
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,919
uh when have you started i think it's

544
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,039
earlier even than 2016 uh with pentest

545
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,840
tools um and uh i trust that our

546
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
audience will will get to

547
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,280
learn a bit about your story um and

548
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
we i want to inspire people but i also

549
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,159
love what andre said that he wants to

550
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,799
quit uh every once in a while because

551
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,039
there are difficult stuff

552
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,200
and the idea is not to scare people but

553
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,039
to give them a bit of insight on the

554
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,799
what the challenges that are coming

555
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,159
their way if they are starting a

556
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,000
startups are

557
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,799
and how how not to actually get scared

558
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,120
by them and just to be prepared to to

559
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,000
address those issues so and adrian you

560
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,159
you have a big team now your product is

561
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,799
going very well uh tell us a bit about

562
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,200
your journey so far uh how have you

563
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
grown as a company and as a team and

564
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,360
what were your lessons learned around

565
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,840
along the

566
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,400
way okay okay um

567
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,799
so to start with myself

568
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,120
i i graduated

569
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,000
computer science from polytechnic

570
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,679
bucharest

571
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,880
and then

572
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,559
i worked

573
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,760
as a programmer for one and a half years

574
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,360
and then i switched to

575
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,039
security

576
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,200
and

577
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,360
i've been doing for about six years

578
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,679
penetration testing

579
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,799
when i

580
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,679
quit my job and switched to contest

581
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,000
tools

582
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,440
this was

583
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,559
in around

584
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,279
2016.

585
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,720
back then um

586
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,120
i worked as a penetration tester at one

587
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,520
of the big four companies uh here in

588
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,880
romania

589
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,360
and um

590
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,559
however

591
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,720
before 2016 for about two years before

592
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,440
i've been starting pentest tools as a

593
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,240
hobby project so i was doing it uh

594
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,200
as a

595
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
to see actually how how it is to create

596
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,480
your own website let's say how to put it

597
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
from zero to

598
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,600
to being used by only a few customers or

599
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,919
a few users there weren't even customers

600
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,360
back then

601
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
and um

602
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,840
the thing that uh motivated me to do the

603
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,480
switch was that this

604
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,159
hobby project that

605
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,320
i was doing uh on my own

606
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,400
actually had users and had

607
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,840
people using it and

608
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,679
um they were telling me hey

609
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
this this thing doesn't work very well

610
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,880
you can improve it like this hey

611
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,120
i'm using your tool can you add another

612
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,159
feature here to do this and so on so it

613
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,120
had

614
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,279
it had traction even

615
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,120
from back then

616
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,960
and um my story is that um

617
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
in

618
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,880
2015 i became a father

619
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,200
and i have twins

620
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,840
and

621
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,200
there was a one year when uh when it was

622
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,799
uh very difficult for me to to split to

623
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,919
split my my focus between

624
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,720
family between the full-time job that i

625
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
had and also between

626
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,799
and also to pentestols

627
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,039
and i had to make a decision to quit one

628
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,000
of them

629
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,520
and yeah i quit the job

630
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:53,890
and

631
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,440
[Music]

632
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,679
in 2016 um

633
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
i focused uh

634
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,799
on doing some um freelancing work uh

635
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,480
together with the pentas tools and um

636
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,720
to have more more time for uh for my

637
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,240
family

638
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,559
and uh the nice thing was uh that

639
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,080
i met with razvan roginish

640
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,919
you know him from

641
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,039
from

642
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,120
computer science faculty

643
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
and he told me hey

644
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,640
there is a nice startup program called

645
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
innovation labs

646
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,400
it looks like you would be a good fit

647
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
for that

648
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,840
because you have an early product but

649
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,919
you need a team

650
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,039
so

651
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,400
in 2017

652
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,279
i uh i formed a team together with the

653
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,320
two two students from from the faculty

654
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,919
and we participated in innovation labs

655
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,840
and we actually won the grand prize

656
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,200
there

657
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,120
and there

658
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,679
also started the um

659
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,640
the relationship with orange

660
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,960
after the after innovation labs we went

661
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,799
through through

662
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,600
to orange fab uh those were some very

663
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,240
nice experiences for us

664
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,320
and uh yes so since uh

665
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,440
since innovation labs we consider pentax

666
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,080
tools as a business so before that was

667
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,000
just a personal project

668
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,440
and

669
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
after that

670
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,399
[Music]

671
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,480
i also

672
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,960
partnered with andrei pitish

673
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,919
which who you probably know

674
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,080
from the romanian startup scene

675
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,200
and right now he's a co-founder at

676
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,799
pentestools

677
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,320
and

678
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,039
together we we grew the team and right

679
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,559
now we are

680
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,440
about

681
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,360
35 people something like that and um

682
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,480
still uh

683
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,960
still we need to to grow far uh further

684
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,399
because uh

685
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,840
actually the customers are asking us for

686
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,120
more features and more

687
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,200
a better product

688
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
yeah i'm curious when you decided to to

689
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,080
quit your job basically was pentestose

690
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,799
creating any revenue

691
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,520
yes it did create some revenue but very

692
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,720
very small

693
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,200
very very small but um

694
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,000
the thing is that uh i saw that it can

695
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,559
create revenue that was the

696
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,080
the main thing so

697
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,799
it's it's uh very difficult to to move

698
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,279
the needle from zero to one when you see

699
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
that you did something then that

700
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,520
something can be further improved than

701
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,399
uh

702
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,399
to grow it

703
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,200
yeah so that again that was uh with the

704
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,399
new family extension on your side that

705
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,200
was very brave for you to do right but i

706
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,440
understand that what gave you the

707
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
courage to do this was also the trust

708
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,520
that your product was going to grow if

709
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,039
you invest in it

710
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,799
everybody told me that it was crazy

711
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,799
actually

712
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,200
but

713
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,279
yeah i had

714
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,200
i had some trust that uh

715
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,159
that it will work

716
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,520
for for me as a person i'm not a very

717
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,919
optimistic guy let's say

718
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,960
i don't believe that something will work

719
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,000
if i

720
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,610
tell myself to work so

721
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,279
[Music]

722
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,200
if if i say yeah it will be great it

723
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,120
will be awesome everything it doesn't

724
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,480
mean that it will actually be so um

725
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,600
i try to keep my expectations uh pretty

726
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,200
uh realistic so um

727
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,159
yeah i i did some calculations and uh

728
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,760
yeah i i i said i could take the risk

729
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,279
and um

730
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,200
the beautiful part in the whole in this

731
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,880
whole journey was that um

732
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,840
me i'm pretty passionate about what i'm

733
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,600
doing and

734
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
yeah it was very hard

735
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
it still is very hard because

736
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,039
since the team grows there are

737
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,200
different uh type of different types of

738
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,320
challenges

739
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,520
but

740
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,600
i still like very much what uh what i'm

741
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,640
doing so that's that's what uh keeps me

742
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,559
ticking let's see

743
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,279
yes so it's not insane braveness right

744
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,440
just being delusional into thinking that

745
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,919
you if you put the work into it it's

746
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,799
going to work it's actually learning and

747
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,039
probably validating that what you are

748
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,240
doing

749
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,880
works have to actually

750
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,559
so you have to

751
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
if you have to climb a ladder

752
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,159
from step 0 to step 10 you actually need

753
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,320
to

754
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,919
climb every

755
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,080
every step so

756
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,840
it's not enough to say yeah i will get

757
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,760
to step 10 but you don't know how to do

758
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,840
it so you have to think of every step

759
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,120
how to how you move further and to

760
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,720
and how you grow

761
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,960
thank you uh just one more curiosity

762
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,080
about the team you said 30 35 people uh

763
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,919
tell us a bit about what types of

764
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,480
activities or types of jobs departments

765
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,799
do you have right because there's the

766
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,679
security part and the actual coding

767
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,279
but then there are a lot of other

768
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,760
activities that you are covering now

769
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,960
yeah we uh when when we started uh

770
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,200
we we were mostly programmers in the

771
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
team but

772
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
after that

773
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,559
since the number of customers grew

774
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,399
we actually needed

775
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,399
more resources

776
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,320
in the areas of

777
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,720
marketing content marketing

778
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,159
uh this is one of

779
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,559
one of our channels to to grow uh then

780
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,559
we had uh we have a support team uh who

781
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,559
a customer success team

782
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,600
who

783
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,519
keeps the relationship with the with the

784
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,799
customers

785
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,360
um recently we

786
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,880
uh we have uh colleagues for uh

787
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,039
web design um

788
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,320
and uh

789
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,440
yeah so

790
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,000
it's uh and uh yeah

791
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,799
besides the uh the security team uh who

792
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,559
is actually doing uh

793
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,200
security research so uh the biggest part

794
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,039
of the of the

795
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,679
of the team actually is uh software

796
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,679
development so this is actually the

797
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,960
biggest part

798
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,679
and

799
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,120
the others are

800
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
a bit a bit smaller but

801
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,480
every

802
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,440
every part of the team has its own

803
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,000
importance and um the actual business

804
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,360
could not run as it uh runs without any

805
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,200
of the of the parts so

806
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,120
everybody's important thank you yeah

807
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
thank you adi uh i i just pressed the

808
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,039
mic to chris tilbury to tell us about

809
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,880
the the the the different types of uh

810
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,360
of departments to say right of jobs

811
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,679
inside the company you are also quite a

812
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,720
big team

813
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,200
uh what types of activities do you do

814
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,840
yeah so of course mainly software

815
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,399
development uh the majority of the team

816
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,080
um they are software development um

817
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,760
skilled persons

818
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,039

um

825
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,039
we we are

826
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,679
we came from a services world

827
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,720
and we were not developers either if i

828
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
also finished in graduated computer

829
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,880
science and by the way again i remember

830
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,200
you as a teacher in my

831
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,159
uh

832
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,880
master penetration

833
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,320
security

834
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,440
yeah subject i had i remember perfectly

835
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,360

836
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,039
cool stuff

837
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,080
interesting and uh i believe it's still

838
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,279
actual what what we learned 10 years ago

839
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,320
um so um indeed yeah software

840
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
development uh i'm coming from the

841
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,640
subject matter expertise world i'm an

842
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,399
infrastructure guy

843
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,360
i know how switchy's router's firewalls

844

work

845
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,600
um and uh it was a lot of

846
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,800
onboarding from from my perspective on

847
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,599
how to structure a software development

848
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,879
team with agile framework and

849
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,679
we add all these expertise in the team

850
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,800

a lot of

852
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,599
a lot of um

853
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,800
influence here uh it's also having our

854

magnum period

856
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,599
he is the software development brain in

857
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,159
our team uh so besides of the

858
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,560
development uh subject matter expertise

859
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,719
in areas of cyber security and

860
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,159
infrastructure

861
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,399
um we are also adding um

862
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,199
yeah we added expertise from ai

863
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,440
perspective where we're having

864
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,560
colleagues which are uh working

865
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,920
on the deep research mathematical level

866
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,720
of neural networks and

867
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,320
ai

868
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,839
edge bleeding edge technologies and um

869
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:08,960
this

870
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,040
this triangle is

871
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,280
it's

872
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,400
maybe our biggest advantage because

873
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,240
we are trying to add all these three

874
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,960
types of expertise in one product and

875
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,760
the customer just to use it and yeah to

876
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,560
be

877
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,960
easy just with a

878
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,040
gui graphical user interface to take the

879
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,000
benefits of deep neural networks and

880
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,359
reinforcement learning and uh

881
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,839
very very hard to understand the

882
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,880
technologies uh of course we also

883
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,720
we invented ourselves

884
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,280
in terms of coming from services moving

885
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,400
to products psycho psychology uh which

886
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,720
was also a break

887
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,880
breakthrough um

888
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,800
even if we are still delivering that

889
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,680
kind of services and we are having a

890
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,160
branch of services attached to ikana as

891
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,880
a product like installing

892
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,040
model feedback ai model feedback

893
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,960
collecting the the subject matter

894
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,640
expertise into the model for each

895
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,320
customers

896
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,160
these kind of services are still there

897
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,680
but it was a major breakout for our

898
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,760
philosophy and the way of creating a

899
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,640
team

900
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,040
from services service delivery to

901
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
product company it's a pretty big

902
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,160
difference we we we felt it

903
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,480
thank you christine um speaking about

904
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,280
moving from service to product cyborg is

905
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,480
also

906
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,599
a use case of this florina

907
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,560
tell us a bit about how it is to go from

908
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,119
uh the the mindset of providing services

909
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,200
to your clients basically you do

910
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,040
activities and you get paid for

911
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,599
providing those activities right into

912
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,480
building a platform that can be used by

913
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,200
the by the users alone uh how is that

914
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,720
and what what's different

915
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,000
i must say that it's challenging to say

916
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,920
the least because we we started to

917
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
cyberaudio is actually a spin-off from

918
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,079
bit sentinel

919
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,000
in bit sentinel we do

920
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,720
cyber security services so all the team

921
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,000
is actually a cyber security specialist

922
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,480
somehow on the different sides red or

923
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,599
blue

924
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,560
um in cyborado uh

925
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,720
right now we are

926
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,359
tr we are still trying to figure out how

927
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,720
to transform all our knowledge from

928
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,520
cyber security services to a product so

929
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,560
we are still building a lot of content

930
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,800
and features and

931
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,160
lots of uh knowledge also for us on the

932
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,200
way we we develop the product but i

933
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,640
think it's uh it's it's very challenging

934
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,839
uh once you start to build a product

935
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,480
from from a service you you get to see

936
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,960
that you have so many things to develop

937
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,760
and to add like features and you get

938
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
feedback from the users you get feedback

939
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,560
from the customers and you get to

940
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,640
stay at the table and just to start

941
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,000
prioritize what we need now what we

942
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,880
where we want to go this year and to to

943
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,000
have like a big picture on the product

944
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and this is quite challenging but it's

945
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,040
also uh very exciting for us because we

946
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,440
are doers we like to

947
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,000
get things done actually this is the

948
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,079
good part of being a startup you can

949
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,400
implement your ideas and you can

950
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,839
add your mark

951
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,839
to the product you're building and it's

952
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,599
really great

953
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,560
uh what do you do to to learn

954
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
what what you need to change inside the

955
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
product

956
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,960
how do you understand what's happening

957
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,160
there what needs to be improved

958
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,520
uh we talk a lot with with our customers

959
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,400
and with our users actually on cyberdo

960
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,119
we have a discord channel and lots of

961
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,400
users

962
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,560
tell us okay we would like to have this

963
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,119
or this of course we have a long to do

964
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,480
list of

965
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,960
new features coming up and things to add

966
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,720
or or update

967
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,400
but we take into account

968
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,040
all of them in order to see if it's

969
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,640
feasible or not for us and i think um a

970
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,520
close connection with with our customers

971
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,640
also help us because we we talk with

972
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,800
universities to really understand their

973
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,599
need for instance because

974
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,280
different universities from different

975
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,000
countries have different way to to teach

976
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,880
their students so we kind of

977
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,599
we need to see how it works in order to

978
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,320
adapt and adjust because

979
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
every country every

980
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,000
educational method it's a bit

981
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,599
challenging but

982
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,480
we have a common passion for learning

983
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,880
and teaching cyber security so

984
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,200
we just need to add the things together

985
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,439
in order to to adapt and adjust

986
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,160
so you have opened the the communication

987
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
channel for people to come and

988
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,000
give you ideas uh do you also have

989
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,119
complaints um i don't know if anyone can

990
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,480
can take this how how is that going

991
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,319
of course we have complaints i think

992
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,160
every product has complaints if you

993
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,200
don't if you don't have a user or

994
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,960
someone who is complaining about about

995
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,119
your product it means that he doesn't

996
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,960
really use it so

997
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,079
we we accept complaints and we always

998
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,800
want to learn what what's wrong in order

999
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,200
to see if we can improve or if it's

1000
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,200
something like for a user experience or

1001
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,359
if it's really a bug on the on the

1002
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,079
platform or in the

1003
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,960
in the lab that the user is trying to to

1004
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,000
access

1005
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,160
we we take all these complaints as

1006
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,280
learning curves because in as a startup

1007
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,200
this is what you do in the first years

1008
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,280
you learn and you develop and you learn

1009
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,760
and you develop and you build because

1010
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,359
you start from an idea and you go to uh

1011
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,599
to market and to customers and to users

1012
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,240
and you need to be open to accept

1013
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,359
feedback and to learn from it

1014
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,319
thank you floridina indeed uh people who

1015
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,280
were passionate enough to complain uh

1016
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,800
that's actually a good sign right

1017
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,160
because they have the need and they're

1018
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,839
trying to do something with your product

1019
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,960
which is what you want and they care so

1020
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,359

that right

1032
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,760
well yeah well there are a lot of

1033
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,599
frustrations

1034
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,880
for instance um i started i started the

1035
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,720
kns

i finished it

1037
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,240
back in

1038
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,440
2017 it was

1039
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,960
a fully working

1040
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,119
product or service

1041
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,160
and

1042
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,200
i actually remember how i got into

1043
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,680
orange fab um

1044
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,040
i posted the status on linkedin saying

1045
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,079
okay i finished the kenya's it works

1046
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,280
fine but what the hell am i doing to do

1047
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,359
with it right now because

1048
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,520
it i was you know in a dead end i didn't

1049
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,560
see it how to access the market how to

1050
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,440
grow further et cetera and i remember

1051
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,400
christie patakian

1052
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,040
writing uh write me saying

1053
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,520
come with it uh to us and uh we'll have

1054
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,720
a look

1055
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,560
and i was like okay

1056
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,960
and uh this is how how the journey

1057
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,920
started but uh the the journey was uh

1058
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,040
quite a bumpy road because

1059
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,800
myself

1060
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,960
i wear many hats

1061
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,240
i'm i'm a private consultant cyber

1062
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,800
security researcher

1063
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,200
also i work for some governmental

1064
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,520
agencies with competencies in cyber

1065
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,280
security and

1066
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,680
it was quite a tough choice to

1067
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,720
decide to proceed further in in this

1068
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,920
direction

1069
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,640
uh basically it's quite hard to find the

1070
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,560
right team this is the the main issue

1071
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,800
then it is a lot of

1072
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,079
research

1073
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,200
involved and a lot of

1074
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,480
questions that have no answers that are

1075
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,280
ready to find and you have to to to do

1076
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,480
to do it the the hard way and of course

1077
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,720
you you get to some point where you you

1078
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,359
see no exit and you're like okay i'm

1079
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,520
going to quit i'm going to

1080
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,040
to keep my my day job and have a safe

1081
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,400
life and worry about nothing from now on

1082
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,200
but then again you come to think okay

1083
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,880
but what if i should do it further and

1084
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,720
you kind of pressure yourself into

1085
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,680
overcome any any any blocks that that

1086
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,599
you encounter

1087
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,640
it's too hard to to enumerate right now

1088
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,720
all the all the times and all the

1089
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,359
motives that uh wanted to

1090
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,160
that

1091
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,839
were quite uh

1092
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,440
deal blockers to me

1093
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,960
but

1094
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,680
mainly it is uh it is very important to

1095
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,280
to find the right team i didn't uh i i

1096
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,400
do everything by by myself right now of

1097
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,000
course i'm uh i'm open to finding uh

1098
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,960
some

1099
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,760
some people that could add value to to

1100
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,400
the to the service and to the product

1101
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,760
but uh

1102
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,400
yeah without the determination

1103
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,200
and the self-motivation i don't think i

1104
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,319
could have got here

1105
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,920
it's uh

1106
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,119
they say it's

1107
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,119
part of the most challenging thing about

1108
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,960
building a product and building a

1109
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,119
startup is the unknown unknowns right

1110
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,160
you don't

1111
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,599
there's a lot of stuff you don't know

1112
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,280
and you don't know that's coming your

1113
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,000
way

1114
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,480
yes exactly exactly that's that's the

1115
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,319
best way to put it

1116
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,359
so um let's uh let's do another round

1117
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,119
table uh

1118
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,119
thinking that you with all the knowledge

1119
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,720
you have today

1120
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,119
are going back to talk to the you that

1121
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,000
was just starting uh and thinking about

1122
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,680
these lessons learned and unknown

1123
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,960
unknowns that came uh what's what is the

1124
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,200
most surprising thing that has happened

1125
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,240
and maybe you can help yourself from the

1126
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,599
beginning to

1127
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,040
to address that

1128
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,920
uh can can you share a bit about this

1129
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,800
i think i would do i would uh go the

1130
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,760
same way with the same approach luckily

1131
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,160
it was the the right approach for me

1132
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,599
um

1133
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,160
i don't have any advice to give to give

1134
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,520
to my younger self except to keep doing

1135
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,079
what you're doing and try to improve

1136
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,520
yourself

1137
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,200
in a in a permanent

1138
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,960
manner and

1139
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,720
what is very important never focus

1140
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,200
on the on the money just

1141
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,920
be wary to create

1142
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,480
a good product a quality a quality

1143
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,160
service and

1144
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,599
at some point people will notice it and

1145
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,359
they will they will start using it so

1146
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,880
it's very important to

1147
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,119
to keep to be persistent

1148
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,040
and

1149
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,800
be self motivated so no never never give

1150
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,839
up if you really believe in in something

1151
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,400
yeah frustration is coming but keep at

1152
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,560
it right yes exactly

1153
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,720
thank you thank you andre yeah yeah

1154
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,160
thank you thank you uh let's see florina

1155
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,960
can you share a bit about uh

1156
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,880
what what was unexpected maybe and uh

1157
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,280
it's good to know from the beginning

1158
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,640
i would also um agree with what andre

1159
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,520
said

1160
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,319
uh it's it's very good if you start your

1161
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,920
journey with uh making sure that you

1162
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,000
expect the unexpected because um

1163
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,880
sometimes we tend to like

1164
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,359
think about okay we will do this and

1165
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,160
this and this and once you're starting

1166
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,599
to doing everything you realize that

1167
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,040
the day has only 24 hours and the

1168
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,160
daylight in winter it's even smaller so

1169
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,960
you just need to focus a lot all your

1170
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,160
energy in what you're trying to build

1171
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,960
and to really keep your passion open

1172
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,839
because uh i think the like the main

1173
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,000
ingredient for any startup is to be

1174
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
passionate about what they are doing

1175
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,240
without passion and without ambition you

1176
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,079
cannot build a startup and uh you can

1177
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,079
work for a startup definitely but you

1178
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,920
cannot build a startup

1179
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,240
there are so many challenges like ups

1180
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,240
and downs every day

1181
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,119
and it's quite challenging but uh it's

1182
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,760
also rewarding on the other side and i

1183
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,280
think like

1184
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,079
all of us in this panel we we are adding

1185
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,559
our experience into changing the world

1186
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,680
and into

1187
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,599
improving the cyber security industry

1188
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,240
and it's really great

1189
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,000
i think this is the perfect question for

1190
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,319
you you touched on the the day having

1191
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,079
only 24 hours

1192
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,319
and you do cyber i do you organize death

1193
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,559
camp you're still involved i think it

1194
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,720
beats sentinel a bit how do you actually

1195
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,680
prioritize question

1196
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,280
uh well i i always try to find a balance

1197
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,920
with everything i do i mean i am

1198
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,559
passionate about everything but i also

1199
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,400
have an amazing team

1200
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,920
to work with and um what i love the most

1201
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,400
in depth camp team in uh subreddit team

1202
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
and bit sentinel is the fact that we we

1203
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,760
help each other

1204
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,400
it's it's not enough like you are one

1205
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,920
person and you're trying to do

1206
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,920
everything on your own you cannot do it

1207
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,400
it's unfeasible and it's childish to

1208
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,079
even think about this

1209
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,640
um it's it's

1210
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,200
the best the best thing you can do is

1211
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,559
just to really think of what you can

1212
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,920
do and what you can uh do to ask for

1213
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,240
help in your team because

1214
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,480
each of our team members has lots of

1215
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,880
experience and has eagerness to learn

1216
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,680
and to support the team and i think this

1217
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,760
is also an important aspect for the

1218
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,319
startup to work as a team you cannot be

1219
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,400
one-man show and to think that it will

1220
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,920
work forever it doesn't you need to have

1221
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,960
people to to work with and to help you

1222
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,119
in different

1223
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,440
challenges and also for you to help them

1224
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,880
and to help them grow and in order to to

1225
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,240
get involved and also add their um their

1226
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,520
input in in the startup

1227
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,079
thank you florina christine tell us how

1228
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,720
what was surprising for you in building

1229
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,520
arcana ai

1230
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,079
um

1231
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,800
surprising i don't know if

1232
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,800
um

1233
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,599
so um yeah as i mentioned the the shift

1234
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,480
from services to to product was uh

1235
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,240
something

1236
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,640
a big milestone from my way of thinking

1237
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,119
personally at least um

1238
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,400
and i cannot say i'm surprised that um

1239
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
all everybody

1240
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,559
all the customers

1241
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,680
to whom we present arcana uh they are

1242
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,000
confirming that it's resolving their

1243
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,160
problems and they would like to have

1244
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,240
something like that uh something like

1245
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,040
that in in their ecosystem i can't say

1246
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,680
it's surprising but it's a nice surprise

1247
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,400
it's a nice feeling to receive up the

1248
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,319
energy from the customers from the

1249
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,839
people from yeah i.t world and um the

1250
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,359
the ones who are interested in this kind

1251
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,720
of technologies to be uh positive around

1252
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,559
it and yeah

1253
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,000
validating the idea

1254
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,640
did you have to learn to say in the past

1255
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,720
two two years what did you learn new

1256
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,520
while building arkhan ai um

1257
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,319
i wouldn't say that

1258
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,720
we didn't that do that at least

1259
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,440
personally but uh i

1260
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,559
i

1261
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,680
it's

1262
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,839
better to yeah to

1263
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,400
be confident that what you're doing it's

1264
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,480
the right thing

1265
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,720
and you will succeed in achieving your

1266
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,760
targets

1267
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,440
and um

1268
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,319
don't try to make it perfect because

1269
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,839
don't

1270
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,680
the effort to resolve all the problems

1271
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,359
at once um is is not the real target you

1272
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,960
need to purchase

1273
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,160
to to

1274
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,160
follow and to target is the idea is to

1275
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,200
do one step at a time do it better and

1276
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,680
validate continues to validate with the

1277
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,720
industry conferences customers real

1278
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,280
world and our relationship with orange

1279
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,839
also is helping us to to validate all

1280
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,599
the ideas with

1281
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,359
real environment real market real

1282
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,839
customizing real problems

1283
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,760
so we're going back to prioritizing

1284
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,839
right and not trying to do everything by

1285
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,319
yourself um i know you also got an

1286
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,119
investment so basically that's uh some

1287
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,920
extra help from the outside uh investors

1288
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,559
who put their money in the company to to

1289
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,680
support you into growing the product and

1290
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,079
trusting besides you that the return

1291
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,640
will come in the future right

1292
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,960
yeah indeed that uh

1293
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,880
the investment received from the

1294
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,839
crowdfunding with sid blink uh is the

1295
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,839
formal uh validation that's keep up the

1296
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,800
good job and do it and see you at the

1297
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,400
next milestone uh indeed it's uh

1298
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,119
that is a formal milestone we achieved

1299
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,640
and we yeah we wished we dreamed of two

1300
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,680
years ago when we started so uh even if

1301
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,559
the the road is uh

1302
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,920
uh is we are just fighting to run on the

1303
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,520
on the on the pit lane uh it's not the

1304
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,599
yeah it's a it's nice to have milestone

1305
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,640
and we are dream on the next one

1306
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,800
this is uh this is something typical i

1307
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,280
see into security startups as well

1308
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,880
because you're coming with great

1309
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,440
experience in the industry and when

1310
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,280
you're starting to build products you

1311
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,040
actually very very

1312
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,920
well know the problem you're solving so

1313
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,720
i think this and in adrian's case as

1314
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,960
well is what gives you confidence that

1315
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,800
you are building the right product and

1316
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,640
that the return will come in other

1317
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,880
industries you see people going a lot

1318
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,480
back and forth in just

1319
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,800
discussing uh with the customers and

1320
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,359
understanding about their industry use

1321
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,520
cases uh so uh this this i see an

1322
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,119
interesting thing that's particular to

1323
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,640
the cyber security industry adrian uh

1324
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,880
just tell us a bit about your lessons

1325
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,079
learned along the way uh you have again

1326
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,000
built a team i i'm sure you're still

1327
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,480
prioritizing even if you're 35 people

1328
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,040
you you still have a lot of work uh to

1329
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,839
do you also have an investment right uh

1330
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,000
what again what was surprising what

1331
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,640
would you tell your your past self in

1332
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,000
looking to what what what has been

1333
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,800
before that uh i would like to make a

1334
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,960
comment uh related to

1335
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,839
the

1336
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,040
services versus product uh business

1337
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,240
so um

1338
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,200
we at pentest tools i forgot to mention

1339
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,079
that we also have a services line a

1340
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,200
professional services line and we have a

1341
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,000
another dedicated team for that who do

1342
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,680
penetration testing

1343
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,000
and security assessments for for our

1344
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,200
customers

1345
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,040
and uh in our case um the uh

1346
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,079
the professional services uh line uh

1347
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,240
goes very well hand in hand with the

1348
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,000
product that we are building

1349
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,359
because um uh

1350
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,799
we we get input for the from the actual

1351
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,280
pentesters that are using the the

1352
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,520
product to do services

1353
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,359
uh with it and we improve the uh the

1354
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,400
product

1355
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,839
with this input

1356
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,280
and also

1357
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,319
on the others on the other direction uh

1358
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,960
the product helps the pen testing team

1359
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,520
be more efficient and effective in what

1360
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,079
they are doing so um

1361
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,680
in our case uh

1362
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,400
we tend to also keep and develop this

1363
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,960
this services line uh to go in parallel

1364
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,839
with the product

1365
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,599
um

1366
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,079
regarding lessons learned

1367
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,599
regarding to lessons learned

1368
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,040
maybe i should have

1369
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,160
dedicated more time and energy to

1370
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,319
creating

1371
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,520
a team faster uh because

1372
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,280
i see right now that

1373
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,920
when you have a good team uh

1374
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,799
the team can do things on its own so you

1375
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,599
don't have to manage it

1376
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,799
every day and to micromanage the team uh

1377
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:17,839
because

1378
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,760
if it's a good team then

1379
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,200
you can rely on it to

1380
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,000
to work on its own and uh a team can do

1381
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,480
much more than you would do would you

1382
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,000
would ever do uh as a as an individual

1383
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,200
so um

1384
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
yeah that is that is if you have a good

1385
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,760
team right uh if you if you manage to

1386
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,160
get the right people uh do you have some

1387
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,559
tips and tricks on how you're recruiting

1388
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,160
what you're looking for in the people

1389
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,319
that you select they are relating the

1390
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,280
related

1391
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,000
related to the good team uh it's uh

1392
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,839
the way you build it it's the way you

1393
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:52,720
have it

1394
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,680
so um i i'm very

1395
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,480
i

1396
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,480
i pay a

1397
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,000
i pay very much attention when hiring

1398
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,799
new new people into the team

1399
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,960
and besides the

1400
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,400
the technical

1401
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,200
knowledge i look very much at the

1402
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,079
attitude of the person and i um

1403
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,559
since i know everybody from the team

1404
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,920
i can

1405
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,559
estimate pretty well if

1406
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,599
that person will match with the others

1407
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,839
that i already have in the team so um

1408
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:34,079
this this way uh i was able to

1409
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,720
uh to create a group of people who get

1410
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,839
along very well with each other and we

1411
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:40,480
have a

1412
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,240
very nice

1413
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,000
communication and

1414
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,680
friendship relationship i would say

1415
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,400
between everybody in the team so yeah

1416
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,079
it's it's very important when you

1417
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,640
recruit a person to look also

1418
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,040
at the attitude and at the

1419
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,559
personal uh

1420
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,760
skills of the

1421
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,520
of the of the person that you're trying

1422
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,200
to hire not only to the technical part

1423
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,359
so you're looking okay so you're looking

1424
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,760
for a matching personalities across the

1425
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,359
team right and then uh but this i i

1426
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,280
guess this uh this also means that you

1427
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,200
invest a lot of time into looking for

1428
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,440
the right person then making sure that

1429
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,160
they find their place in the team

1430
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,359
yeah because i know um when a person

1431
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,480
when i i look for a new person i usually

1432
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,920
know uh

1433
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,359
with whom

1434
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,079
he or she will interact in the team

1435
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,359
and

1436
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,319
i know their personalities and i also uh

1437
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,839
put them to

1438
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,720
discuss together before actually hiring

1439
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,760
them and uh to to see if they match and

1440
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,640
uh

1441
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,520
if they uh can work actually together

1442
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,640
so thank you

1443
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,480
yeah that's very valuable so you get

1444
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,960
input from from the teammates as well

1445
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,000
um we were thank you very much we were

1446
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,920
discussing about uh

1447
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,720
understanding the industry very well

1448
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,280
and again starting to build products

1449
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,520
that you know are solving a problem that

1450
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,559
you already had um johan i'll i'll go

1451
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,680
back to you because at orange you have

1452
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,000
quite a good visibility on what's going

1453
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,680
on in the market

1454
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,839
and i know you're also educating

1455
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,359
yourself always

1456
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,680
in looking at what is happening in other

1457
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,559
markets that are sort of an inspiration

1458
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,400
for us like you just discuss about the

1459
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,920
security operation centers and

1460
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,400
universities are there in your talk

1461
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,920
that was again something that's

1462
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,640
happening in other countries and you you

1463
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,599
see it

1464
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,160
growing um

1465
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,119
thinking

1466
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,520
with our audience in mind and

1467
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,240
i i truly trust that people are watching

1468
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,960
this panel and starting to to get

1469
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,040
inspired and uh

1470
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,280
get confidence to start creating a

1471
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,319
startup right uh what where do you think

1472
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,640
uh the the next generation of startups

1473
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,119
in cyber securities is going to be what

1474
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,839
are the main problems we still have to

1475
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,400
to solve

1476
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:08,880
good question

1477
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,319
and i i will undoubtfully

1478
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,680
somehow connect my answer to the

1479
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,400
pandemic because there's been almost one

1480
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,920
and a half hours and nobody mentioned

1481
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,079
kovi 19 in this panel it's truly

1482
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,400
unbelievable but uh

1483
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,079
the the the true trends that are somehow

1484
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:29,599
uh you know capturing the moment are um

1485
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,920
actually uh they're stemming from some

1486
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,960
needs

1487
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,240
um

1488
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,960
coming from uh this push to a new normal

1489
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,520
to remote everything remote friendly

1490
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,440
expanded um

1491
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,480
um

1492
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,799
you know expanded borders specifically

1493
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,160
on security

1494
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,119
added complexity on infrastructures

1495
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:49,920
and

1496
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,240
everything else so uh

1497
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,359
my a key takeaway at least from my

1498
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:58,079
perspective is that the future is going

1499
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,520
to be a bit more data centric and less

1500
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,079
and a bit less user-centric

1501
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,079
so it's probably that it's probable that

1502
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,319
cyber security will have to align in

1503
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:09,680
some way with

1504
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,160
trends

1505
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,520
regarding the

1506
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,240
generation processing and

1507
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,440
analysis of threat data

1508
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,960
and this means

1509
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,960
that uh new startups or new um i don't

1510
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,119
know new interest domains in cyber

1511
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,799
security should have a clear focus on

1512
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,280
on generating um

1513
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,200
you know like

1514
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,400
real real-world applicable threat data

1515
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,440
such as threat intelligence

1516
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,480
and uh should focus on having a capacity

1517
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,720
to interpret to analyze and to interpret

1518
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,680
set data in such a way that it provides

1519
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,680
an immediate and

1520
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,880
cohesive

1521
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,720
visibility on

1522
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,920
the entire landscape of the business or

1523
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,720
or

1524
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,960
on the entire infrastructure

1525
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,760
and

1526
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,960
of course linking these two

1527
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,599
um you know

1528
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,240
linking these two concepts or aspects

1529
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,200
together

1530
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,400
is um awareness in user education this

1531
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,760
is

1532
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,720
this was is and definitely will be at

1533
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,240
the forefront

1534
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,319
of um

1535
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,319
having a uh

1536
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,960
positive security posture

1537
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,640
so um

1538
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,920
in a very brief conclusion

1539
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,480
invest big in data processing invest big

1540
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,000
in threat intelligence and invest hugely

in education this is my

1542
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,880
