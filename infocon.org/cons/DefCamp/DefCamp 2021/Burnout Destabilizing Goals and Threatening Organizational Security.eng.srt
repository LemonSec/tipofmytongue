risky and i'm very excited to talk about

6

heart about burnout but also i get to

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,160
touch about how our industry could

really use some help right now on making

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,640
things better for everyone

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,800

burnout is not

you it's not about self-care anymore it

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
is about how we are

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,559
in this certain system that we are

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,920
placed in and how it keeps causing us to

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
get burned out which i'm going to touch

21

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,000
now let's get into the real reason why

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,960
you're here today

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
i just want to say that you may be here

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,960
right now

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,680
let's be honest with one another

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,119
the pandemic

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,240
there was no guide on how to survive it

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,439
and we're still in a pandemic

50
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,719
and we are on a fine line of just being

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,759
okay

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,320
and not being okay

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,159
and we've been dealing with burnout even

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,280
before the

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,598
pandemic within our industry so that's

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,360
why it's important for us to talk about

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
this because even if when the pandemic

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
is over we still have to address this

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,040
with burnout we do place ourselves an

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,840
organization at a security risk we're

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
more likely to click on a link

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,520
because we're not 100 who we are because

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,480
our

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
we are not a full completely charged

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
battery in a sense so we're going to

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,640
make a lot more mistakes

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,599
um we may not even patch correctly we

68
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,760
may be overwhelmed of what is needed to

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,519
be patched but also let's be real

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,480
sometimes us being insecurity

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,800
people see us as kind of like robots and

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
not humans um and this is one of the

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
things is that within security itself

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
we're expected to work 24 7 and always

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,519
be at the edge of our seat 24 7

76
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,480
because that is what's expected of us is

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,280
to work all hours and be expected to be

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,159
on calls at all hours because

79
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,280
security is 24 7.

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,239
so

81
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,080
at the end of the day is how do you even

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,640
balance a personal life and work life

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,879
because the reality is is that if we're

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,599
not balancing our work and personal life

85
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,640
that's when we start having burnout

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,519
because that balance is gone

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,159
so you may even see signs of it such as

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,319
like

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,200
you've

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,360
noticed changes with your colleagues

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
even with yourself

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,760
they

93
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,239
may be withdrawn or fast to become angry

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,760
and sad

95
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,400
you might see delay and responses or

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
projects and this could be seen remote

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,599
too you don't have to actually be in

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,440
person to know if someone's burned out

99
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,480
or not

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,159
but this is the thing is to understand

101
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,439
is that since we've been remote

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,040
and also since we've been working from

103
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
home and the pandemic the thing is is

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,799
that it's incredibly hard to put a line

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,760
in the sand saying this is my work time

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,319
this is my personal time and putting

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,680
boundaries down

108
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,319
because it's almost impossible in the

109
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,639
past to have boundaries when you work in

110
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,000
security

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
but the thing is is that i think at this

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,120
point

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
we are starting to realize if we don't

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
put down boundaries when we're not

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,880
practicing more balancing of work and

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,479
personal life

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,800
we end up getting burned out and the

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
effects can be really bad

119
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,680
and for those that aren't aware of how

120
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,759
bad burnout can start forming and

121
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,120
looking like

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,440
it used to be that it took a few minutes

123
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,320
to respond to an email now it takes

124
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,759
hours or days you may feel exhausted and

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,720
trapped

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,600
you might even feel empty you may push

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,919
yourself to like this breaking point and

128
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,600
it's almost impossible to come up with

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
new ideas or new strategies and then you

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
start getting some aches here and there

131
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,600
as well you get overly anxious over

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,560
events and deadlines you can get angry

133
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,199
or you can get sad very fast

134
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
and the other thing is that you may even

135
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,960
not respond to your friends and family

136
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,280
at you know at a certain time not

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,320
because you're busy it's because

138
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,600
you're worried that that's going to be

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
another task on top of everything and

140
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,360
that's when you start having this guilt

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
that comes in

142
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,400
and when that guilt starts coming in

143
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
it's reminding you that your personal

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,919
life is now slipping your work has

145
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,840
become your life

146
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,560
and then when your life is your work you

147
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
start feeling under appreciated for

148
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,199
everything that you have given up to be

149
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,840
in that role or where you work

150
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,720
and then you get resentful at your work

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,800
now when you get resentful this ends up

152
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,080
being this change of hating and dreading

153
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,240
going to your job this is the moment

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,199
that you do lose team members so burnout

155
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,000
is something very very serious

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,919
and it's not just that but also when we

157
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,639
don't address burnout this can happen to

158
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,880
your body you're going to feel exhausted

159
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,720
you're going to struggle to sleep you

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
can you'll start mimicking the same

161
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,520
symptoms as anxiety and depression

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
you'll start noticing that you get sick

163
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,680
more often your muscles get tight and

164
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,280
sore you might get more headaches

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,680
suddenly or

166
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,600
gastrointestinal issues as well

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,520
and

168
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,280
cardiovascular problems increase so this

169
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,880
gives you a higher

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
chance of

171
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,960
the stress that's been prolonged for too

172
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
long so you have high blood pressure and

173
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,080
heart attacks and strokes

174
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,440
because there's too much adrenaline

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,680
cortisol in your body over an extended

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,280
time

177
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,440
so burnout is not a joke it is something

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,680
serious and no matter how much you push

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
it and you don't want to address it the

180
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,319
thing is

181
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,800
it will hit you and when it does it will

182
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
hit you hard

183
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,599
so the thing is is why are we burnt out

184
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,560
within our industry like i said before

185
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,800
we operate 24 7 around the clock and

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
even in the middle of night that means

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,880
if i get a phone call at 2 or 3 in the

188
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,960
morning that means i need to take that

189
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,199
phone call because it's important

190
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,800
because i don't want to put anyone at

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,599
risk and neither do you so that's the

192
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,520
thing is like we're always around the

193
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,919
clock it's very hard to ever have a

194
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,319
moment of just relaxing or

195
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,599
whether or not

196
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,759
one is the call going to happen that

197
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,599
there's a breach

198
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,840
because the thing is attackers they go

199
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,160
at all hours and we're always knowing

200
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,560
that a breach is going to occur it will

201
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,440
occur eventually we just don't know when

202
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,080
and this is the thing

203
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,160
we're also really scared when there is a

204
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
breach because we know that it's most

205
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,560
likely going to be an ad hoc style to

206
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
fix it

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,759
because the reality is according to the

208
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,520
opponent institute while security

209
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,759
response planning is slowly improving

210
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,759
year after year that the vast majority

211
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,680
of organizations

212
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,599
74 of them

213
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,879
reported not having a any incident

214
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,000
response plan or having an ad hoc plan

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,960
when it comes to having a breach

216
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,120
this also means that those that did have

217
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,759
plans in the first place

218
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,080
um they didn't have any time of when

219
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,240
they're going to review or when they

220
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,160
were going to

221
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,680
test them out or revisit them at a date

222
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
and this is really scary for us because

223
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
well we don't have up-to-date plans

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,159
how how are we

225
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,559
it's the the just amount of stress and

226
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,880
weight on our shoulders of

227
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,760
how are we going to deal with this when

228
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,839
this crisis happens so this is why it's

229
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,160
important if we put more attention

230
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
towards preparing and prevention we have

231
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,720
a better chance of feeling like we're

232
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,519
we're a little bit less stressed

233
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
but this also allows us to know that if

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,880
we are burned out and we have a call

235
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,800
saying that there is a breach

236
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,360
we have a procedure that's intact that

237
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
we can actually utilize

238
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,720
now the other thing is is that 94 of the

239
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
forbes 2000 list still don't have

240
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,240
vulnerability disclosure policies so

241
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,880
this is another hard thing for

242
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,760
uh having security plans is that if you

243
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
don't have security strategy that

244
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
doesn't incorporate having a bug bounty

245
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,040
program

246
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,720
and or a vulnerability disclosure

247
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
policies

248
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
it is a horrible situation because the

249
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,920
thing is there's too much reliance on a

250
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,800
security team and we need diverse eyes

251
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
to find bugs so then

252
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
we're able to fix it but it also is one

253
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,040
of those things that we have to come

254
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,920
to this point in our industry is that we

255
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
need to build a bridge between the

256
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,880
hacker community and the companies

257
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,640
because the reality is if we don't build

258
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,800
that bridge we're going to keep having

259
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,240
these situations and we could have

260
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,720
avoided many breaches

261
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,200
if we had those programs set up

262
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,839
and of course what we tend to do in our

263
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,519
industry is that

264
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,360
we forget about that there's a human

265
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
element at play so what we do is we

266
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,920
throw tools hoping that that's going to

267
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,760
fix the

268
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,079
um and and what i mean by that is that

269
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,880
right now organizations use more than 45

270
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,120
different security tools

271
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,279
and you don't even know how much you can

272
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,640
trust that

273
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,959
but also usually our incident response

274
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,720
plan coordination

275
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,399
has approximately 19 tools as well now

276
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,200
are those tools updated

277
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,320
how secure are those tools

278
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,079
were there more tools added to them

279
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,279
because remember

280
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,200
most of the plans that we have already

281
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
don't exist or they're out of date the

282
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
other thing is that more tools

283
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
part of the process means that there's

284
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
going to be a slower remediation time

285
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,959
and it's going to cost more money

286
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,519
and let me paint a picture of how

287
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,600
stressful this situation is for a

288
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,240
security team now

289
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,360
i want you to imagine that you're on

290
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
a crew and you're on this cruise ship

291
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,760
and you just found out that your ship is

292
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
sinking but you found a little bit late

293
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,120
because you weren't alerted by your

294
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,519
system on time

295
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,519
your customers are bored

296
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,920
and they're trusting you for their

297
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,959
safety

298
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,440
now the one thing to remember is that

299
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,399
your team

300
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,560
is a bit scared this is a brand new

301
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,399
situation even though they've practiced

302
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,839
multiple times on what to do in this

303
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,519
situation the thing is is that they're

304
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,279
scared because they're suddenly in the

305
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,040
heat of the moment

306
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
but the thing to also keep in mind is

307
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,680
that there is this fear

308
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,880
of failing that can paralyze people too

309
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
when they're in uh

310
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,320
you know when they're dealing with a

311
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,079
crisis

312
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,639
so the thing to keep in mind here is

313
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,440
that your team your crew is trying their

314
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,519
best to keep everything afloat and to

315
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
make sure that everyone is going to be

316
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
okay with the ship going down now there

317
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,880
is a catch here your team hasn't really

318
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,240
slept well

319
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,720
um they also feel a little seasick so

320
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,880
you could kind of say that they're

321
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
kind of processing and operating as if

322
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,680
they have burnout in other words they

323
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,120
are not exactly 100 state of mind

324
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,639
and this is something to keep in mind

325
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
so now you have the back story

326
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,720
now i want you to imagine your captain

327
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
pulls out the safety binder

328
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
to know what is the protocol for this

329
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,120
ship

330
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,399
but unfortunately that binder

331
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,360
that was updated is not on that ship at

332
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,079
all so you're using an old procedure but

333
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,480
have new features to the ship and your

334
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,800
team is burned out in a sense because

335
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,720
they're seasick and they're paralyzed by

336
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
the fear of failing are you stressed out

337
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,800
now because this is what it's like

338
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
when we deal with bad plans and when the

339
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
human element is taken out it leaves you

340
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,839
with a wreckage

341
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,360
literally

342
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
the truth is is that bad actors are

343
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,279
everywhere and they take all hours and

344
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,760
zero days drop often and we constantly

345
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,000
need to be up to date of what bad actors

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,399
use this takes time and energy and this

347
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,920
is why we're struggling because we're

348
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,680
part of a crew

349
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,880
but

350
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
we don't function well or communicate

351
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,560
well it could become a really scary

352
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,519
situation and the reason is that we are

353
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,959
insecurity

354
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,320
because we know it's incredibly

355
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,720
important to protect one another

356
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,880
and the other thing is to keep in mind

357
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,959
is that we've also come to terms that we

358
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,120
work around the clock and we don't even

359
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
have time to practice self-care because

360
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,160
of the demand and the stress of where

361
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,240
what we're doing

362
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,279
so

363
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,920
you have to understand when we come to a

364
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,720
place in our career we might be like

365
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,880
what is the point of this

366
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,000
if our employer isn't helping us or our

367
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,920
industry isn't changing

368
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,240
how are we going to change things in a

369
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,639
sense

370
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,760
and this is why burnout matters is that

371
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,000
if we keep turning to tools

372
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
and we don't find the time to digest the

373
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,880
human element of this that is in play

374
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
we're never going to be able to get

375
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,560
where we want to go with our security

376
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,839
team and that is the reason why

377
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,480
we also need to rely on the hacker

378
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
community because the reality is the

379
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,040
hacker community is going to find the

380
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,240
bugs your security team cannot find

381
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
and this is important to note because

382
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
it's better to have the hacker committee

383
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
find those vulnerabilities than an

384
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,279
attacker to get a hold of that

385
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,600
vulnerability and not report it to you

386
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
and take advantage of you you don't want

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,760
to breach right none of us want to

388
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
breach that's why we're in this in the

389
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,800
first place

390
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,959
and that's why we have to understand

391
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,120
something which is

392
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,760
we cannot overly rely on our security

393
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,040
teams to find all the bugs

394
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,680
because the reality is that your team is

395
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,639
most likely burned out at some point or

396
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,240
at least one person is going to be

397
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,279
burned out on your team at all times

398
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,600
and so this is the thing is is that we

399
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,199
need to understand that having

400
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,680
vulnerability disclosure policies and

401
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,240
bug bounty programs are incredibly

402
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,959
important to our strategy when it comes

403
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,480
to security

404
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,959
but also it allows us to

405
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,240
partner with individuals that are trying

406
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,240
to help us in other words

407
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,519
now the thing i want to just say is that

408
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,360
when you do have a bug bounty of honor

409
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,920
really disclosure policies in place it's

410
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,759
so incredibly important

411
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,240
that you have someone who can manage

412
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
inquiries and delegate bugs and also can

413
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,600
be on top of communicating and this is

414
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
why having a bug bounty program such as

415
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,480
hacker one it's incredibly important to

416
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
have that

417
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,320
it makes it easier for communicating for

418
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
finding and fixing those bugs faster

419
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,800
than ever which does keep you protected

420
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,440
from attackers

421
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,240
now

422
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,560
for the bug bounty hunters that are

423
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,720
listening to this

424
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,600
first of all thank you for doing what

425
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,560
you do

426
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,440
because

427
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
we need you at the end of the day we

428
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,279
need you even if organizations don't

429
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,959
have vulnerability disclosure policies

430
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,880
or a bug batting program they will one

431
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,759
day

432
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,240
because they will realize they need you

433
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,120
too

434
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,360
we can't always rely on our own team we

435
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,680
have to get outside help

436
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
now the thing i can tell

437
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,000
from your perspective is that the

438
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
reality is that

439
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,240
we can put in so many hours to find bugs

440
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,839
and there comes a point where we don't

441
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,079
find things for weeks and months and

442
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,160
this can be alarming and this can be

443
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,279
scary and the reality is that sometimes

444
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,199
we just need to take a break

445
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,720
taking a break from everything from

446
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,560
infosec and then coming back a week

447
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,199
later you'll feel a lot more refreshed

448
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,040
but the thing is is that bug bounty

449
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,760
hunters it's it's a lot of hours and

450
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,439
dedication if you're doing this full

451
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,119
time and especially if you're doing this

452
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
part-time and having a full-time

453
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,520
security job it's a lot of work

454
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,839
so trying to find time to balance that

455
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,119
personal life is also really hard

456
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,439
but the other thing is stressful is like

457
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,919
waiting for the communication

458
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,400
like there it can be terrible i'll be

459
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,880
honest there's delays and expectations a

460
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,799
conflict all the time when trying to get

461
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,039
paid out or getting an update on the bug

462
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,679
that you submitted and this can be also

463
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,919
very stressful and when we have so much

464
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,240
stress that isn't being dealt with this

465
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,640
ends up turning into burnout

466
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,280
so it's really important that

467
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,559
when we report to an organization is for

468
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,880
us to both understand

469
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,559
that

470
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,679
we're all

471
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,559
part of a situation and we all have

472
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,200
wants and desires and it's also a really

473
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,400
stressful to be in this industry

474
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
and i want to talk about that a little

475
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,720
bit further into this conversation

476
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
but first i just want to say is that

477
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
overall i hope

478
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,600
from the beginning of this conversation

479
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
is that everyone's pretty much burned

480
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,720
out at some point or at this very moment

481
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,120
and that is the reality of everything is

482
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,280
that with coven 19 we're taking care of

483
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,679
family members we're on camera daily

484
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,080
we're unable to leave our home sometimes

485
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,840
we can't see our friends and family and

486
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,600
some of us live alone some of us put off

487
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
some really important life events

488
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,720
and some of us have lost people because

489
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,559
of the pandemic

490
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,480
and our colleagues are struggling we're

491
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,320
struggling some of us are worried of

492
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,720
keeping a job some of us are doing bug

493
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,799
bounty for a living

494
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,160
because

495
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,039
we are trying every way possible to get

496
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,799
funds in our pocket

497
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,679
it's a very weird time

498
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,640
and the thing is it's okay to be honest

499
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,840
and say

500
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
now let's be honest with one another is

501
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,200
that

502
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,120
we can't keep doing everything all the

503
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
time and that's okay

504
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,679
but the thing is is that

505
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,280
we have to figure this out as an

506
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,919
industry of how to do something better

507
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,760
because the human element created

508
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,320
security and runs on security and we're

509
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
all struggling right now to a certain

510
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
extent so let's change this problem and

511
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,320
dive into five investments that we can

512
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,919
do

513
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,559
so first things first listen and take

514
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,679
action together be strong be kind

515
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,720
ask your team what do they need don't

516
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,120
just listen and and then

517
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,200
you know not take actions the thing is

518
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,760
we have to take actions so listen to one

519
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
another and try to get a good idea of

520
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,880
what you can do to help out the

521
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
situation

522
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,960
and because that is the reality of

523
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,039
what's going on is that even on secure

524
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,480
teams we're not being able to

525
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
communicate what is needed

526
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
um it might be like hey we don't need

527
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,240
this tool anymore there's this other

528
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,720
tool that does three things in one

529
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,760
it could also be about trying to get

530
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,640
uh helping your cso out to go to the

531
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,320
board to push for vulnerability

532
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,600
disclosure policies or to get funds

533
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,559
um to even invest in the security team

534
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,200
and

535
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
you know and that's the reality is is

536
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,840
asking people around you how can you

537
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,799
help

538
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,240
because the reality is that we kind of

539
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
have to work together to kind of get out

540
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
of this mess

541
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
like i said listening to one another and

542
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
taking action is definitely important

543
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,039
but also planning together so if you're

544
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,280
on a security team it's really important

545
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,559
is to create strategies and revisit your

546
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,720
security response plan making sure that

547
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,640
it's up to date and also just keep on

548
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,919
remembering

549
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,120
that you know if a tool is added or

550
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,480
removed that should be updated in your

551
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,720
incident response plan if there's a team

552
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
member change that should be updating

553
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,400
your incident response plan if there's

554
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,840
environment change such as everyone's

555
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,440
working from home now that needs to be

556
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
updating your incident response plan

557
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,280
it's so important that we have solid

558
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,440
plans because this does reduce the

559
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,919
stress of when a breach occurs that we

560
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,640
have a game plan in a sense

561
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,799
you owe it to yourselves you owe it to

562
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,480
your team your colleagues your

563
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,440
organization even your customers

564
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,120
now the one thing i want to also say is

565
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,360
that you also do have to practice

566
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,120
certain self-care which is if you're

567
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,960
starting to feel burned out it's time to

568
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,240
take time off that means

569
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
take time off that means

570
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
not being on social media that means

571
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
getting off of your computer your

572
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,159
devices that means taking a whole week

573
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,919
off because studies have shown if you

574
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,760
want to deal with burnout and get rid of

575
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,440
burnout take a whole week off

576
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,240
and

577
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,720
don't do anything work related it's

578
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,480
really important that's the only way

579
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,039
that you can recover believe it or not

580
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,520
is to do that and to make changes in

581
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,400
your workplace or your home life so just

582
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
keep that in mind

583
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,240
and i know that it's

584
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
very scary to take time off because

585
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
sometimes we're afraid if we take time

586
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,640
off that our teammates are going to have

587
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,480
to pick up our work or we're going to be

588
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,559
afraid that we're going to be coming

589
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,799
back to a dumpster fire so it's really

590
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,280
important to understand is

591
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,200
we need to take time off regardless

592
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
because even if you are not taking time

593
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,679
off and you're burned out chances are

594
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,720
you're going to impact someone else

595
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,799
or some other team or some other

596
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,520
organization because you're not able to

597
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,760
properly do what you can do if you

598
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
weren't burned out

599
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,679
now the other thing to keep in mind is

600
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,760
that this also means reducing your

601
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
meetings if you have meetings have one

602
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,960
day off a week for meetings

603
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
um so then we can play catch up in a

604
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,559
sense

605
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
now the other thing i would say is

606
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,400
investment number four is have a

607
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,159
vulnerability disclosure

608
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,720
policies and have or

609
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
an or okay and or a bug bounty program

610
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,520
i mean it if you are if you care about

611
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,840
your security at your organization

612
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,039
have one but also not just have one but

613
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,320
also make sure that it is managed well

614
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,720
and what i mean by that is

615
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,600
having effective communications between

616
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,240
the hackers that are submitting the bugs

617
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,559
and your organization's response it is

618
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,559
so important that we have better

619
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,120
communication across the parties because

620
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,280
that's one of the reasons why

621
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,480
it can be very stressful to participate

622
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,880
so it's really important is to just make

623
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
sure that it's managed well have it

624
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
really structured well

625
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
and really

626
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
really try your best and get feedback

627
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,279
from the hacker so say like how can we

628
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,960
do better next time

629
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,279
ask them they love to respond and tell

630
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
you about that and also

631
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,240
hackers

632
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,559
feel free to reach out to them and ask

633
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,360
them

634
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,159
how can i do better next time how can i

635
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,120
improve my communication or how can i do

636
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,480
better and i think that's the one thing

637
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,799
that we can always do is just ask how

638
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,918
can i do better

639
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,279
now i want to just take this moment here

640
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,000
to just talk really quick on this one

641
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
investment number five is be kind and

642
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
respect boundaries

643
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,600
we have to just understand delays and

644
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
expectations are in conflict all the

645
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,480
time in bug bounty world and also when

646
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
we're reporting vulnerabilities but it's

647
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,799
really really important is to understand

648
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,799
to be kind to one another because we

649
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,960
don't know what the other person's going

650
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,000
through

651
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
and it's really important that we need

652
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,440
to start practicing empathy a little bit

653
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,240
more is to try to understand what their

654
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
situation is like so we can understand

655
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,440
one another

656
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,760
because by having empathy this also

657
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
helps reduce our stress but also this

658
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,960
allows us to

659
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
you know in the end kind of reduce that

660
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,120
burn out here and there or reduce the

661
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,200
possibility of getting burned out

662
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,159
and what i mean by is like

663
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,120
when it comes to submitting bugs

664
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,799
and you're waiting to hear back please

665
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,880
don't harass them

666
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,279
what i mean by that is don't contact

667
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,520
them on their social media that means

668
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,919
don't dm them on their twitter or

669
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,520
linkedin or their facebook or instagram

670
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,000
what i mean by that is understand that

671
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
it is their job and they don't work 24 7

672
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,679
around the clock they have

673
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,159
boundaries they work between nine to

674
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,279
five

675
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,520
in a certain time zone and that the

676
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,720
weekends they don't want to work

677
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,799
and it's really understanding to

678
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,559
understand this whole situation is

679
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,919
please respect boundaries

680
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,919
it is their job but they also have a

681
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,400
personal life outside of work

682
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
and respect that

683
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,120
so

684
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,760
when you do have communication with them

685
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,080
what you can do is ask

686
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,520
when should i follow up

687
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,360
and i like this question quite a bit

688
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,279
because when they ask me that question

689
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,760
when should i follow up

690
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,520
i can give them an idea of like

691
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,200
reach out in two weeks or reach out

692
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,520
within seven days

693
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,600
and this really helps the conversation

694
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,360
because then you just mark it in your

695
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,880
calendar and then you

696
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
write back to them on that day if you

697
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,200
haven't heard back or an update

698
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,320
other thing is that if you are um

699
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,640
basically following up with a hacker

700
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,720
that has submitted a vulnerability it's

701
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
important to understand that

702
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,000
for some bug bounty and hunting

703
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,320
is their income

704
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,039
so

705
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,360
please understand if they're like hey i

706
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,679
haven't been paid out yet

707
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,159
understand that to them getting paid is

708
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,679
really important

709
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,640
because for some is their main income

710
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
and also it doesn't matter the thing is

711
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,039
if they've paid and you've accepted this

712
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,520
bug they should they need to get paid

713
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,480
out

714
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,799
the other thing to keep in mind is that

715
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,840
language and culture does play a role

716
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
we're all around the world we're all

717
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,559
different

718
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,279
so

719
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,039
it's important to be kind in your

720
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,399
responses

721
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,480
but also

722
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,600
be as transparent as possible but also

723
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,159
to provide a time frame for them this

724
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,000
also helps with you when they try to

725
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,080
come back and to follow up with some

726
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,080
updates

727
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,080
so here's a quick slide of what you can

728
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,760
do right now to reduce burnout

729
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,960
is have set 101s for 15 minutes with

730
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,360
each employee if you're on a team make

731
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,919
money or fridays a no meeting day

732
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,360
set up a meeting with your team to

733
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,039
explore ways on how you can improve

734
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,039
together you can always create anonymous

735
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,279
survey to find out what is going on and

736
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,520
how the company can do better but please

737
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,200
note not everyone's going to participate

738
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,840
and don't enforce it but also

739
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,600
have vulnerability disclosure policies

740
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,080
and someone who can manage the incoming

741
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,960
at the same time

742
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,480
and last

743
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,320
remember when we work together and

744
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,559
listen to each other magic does happen

745
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,320
and when we work together making sure

746
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,720
people get personal time off without the

747
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,200
fear and take time away we then become

748
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,760
collaborative but also acknowledging

749
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
that when we collaborate we also reduce

750
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
the stressful items that hold us back

751
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,399
from our team from thriving and focusing

752
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,320
on that balancing to work in person life

753
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,520
is something very important for everyone

754
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,320
and we just support that

755
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,240
and also

756
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,840
we need to work with the hacker

757
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
community bug bounty programs voluntary

758
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
disclosure policies are incredibly

759
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,120
important for reducing the stress on

760
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,679
your teammates because sometimes we need

761
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,240
a little bit of help outside our

762
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,640
security team

763
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,360
so overview right now does place you and

764
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,840
your team at a huge risk collaborate to

765
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,080
form strategies to improve the team

766
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,480
start making plans and revisit security

767
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,279
response plans and promote self-care by

768
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,399
being kind and respectful to boundaries

769
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,640
and also take some breaks that's the

770
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,840
only way you're going to heal from

771
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,279
burnout

772
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,120
i just want to say thank you all so much

773
