1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,560
folks we're nearing the end of the first

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,640
day of death camp and i hope you have

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,799
had a blast i hope you've had the time

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,800
to check both the expo area and the

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,960
hacking village that you've sampled

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,639
talks from both tracks that you're

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,480
interested in and thank you very much

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,760
for interacting with us in the chat

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,640
we have one more speaker lined up

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,720
and i'm really excited to hear his

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
perspective because

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
uh we talk about security professionals

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,400
their arsenal of tools and their

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
knowledge a lot at death camp but i

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,120
think it's worth also exploring the way

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,040
in which the board members of these

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
large companies both those in the public

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
and in the private sector act on

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,840
nurturing security and resilience

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,120
brian who is a vp and ciso of mandiant

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
advantage has a unique perspective on

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
this matter he has recently had

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,199
conversations around this topic on his

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,559
own podcast

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,640
and he found that board members are

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
paying close attention to their

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,120
organization's security programs

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
brian can you give us a sneak peek into

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,079
this world

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,559
so first off uh thank you so much

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,000
everybody for having me here today i've

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
really enjoyed the talks uh great

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,479
technical content uh this is my first

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
time being involved

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
hopefully next time i can actually

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
physically be there it'd be a lot more

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,240
fun but uh

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,119
this will will hopefully be a relatively

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,360
interesting and fun presentation for all

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,200
of you

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,080
let me give you a little bit of

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,560
background you can't have a presentation

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,720
title uh security cyber security in the

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
board choosing success over the starlack

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,119
pit without a little bit of definition

46
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,200
of where that came from uh so

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,119
essentially uh as mentioned i have a a

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,560
podcast called the cyber security

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
effectiveness podcast

50
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,479
and every once in a while i do these

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,439
micro uh podcasts within their focusing

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,920
on military and government or financial

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,159
services or red teamers or reverse

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,640
engineers in different sections

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
but i decided to focus it on board

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,079
members and we always talk about in

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,640
security how security is very strategic

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,399
and it matters to the executives it

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,920
matters to the board

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,280
and i wasn't sure if that was just

61
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,360
hubris or not do they really care and if

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
they do care what do they care about

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
and one of the board members actually

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,360
told me um

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
when he's having conversations with

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,959
these csos and these security executives

67
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
it's often like they're falling into the

68
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
sarlacc pit and i'm sure everybody on

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
this uh on this uh

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,239
zoom knows that reference but just in

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,840
case you don't it's a star wars

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
reference actually return of the jedi

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,480
and it's this uh it's this pit that if

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,120
you fall into you digest very slowly

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,879
over thousands of years so you're dying

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,400
over thousands of years and while you're

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
doing that you're being digested so it's

78
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,599
an awful horrible way to die clearly um

79
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,040
and he was saying that it doesn't have

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
to be that way the problem is that board

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
members and security professionals often

82
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
have different perspectives

83
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,159
they care about different things

84
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,840
they want the same goal they want their

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,440
organization to be safe and secure and

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
successful but

87
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,519
sometimes they're just not connecting so

88
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,360
what i've tried to put together in this

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,640
presentation it's a very short

90
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,480
presentation 30 minutes

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,280
but i've tried to cherry pick a few um

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,640
different board members that i

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,239
interviewed and a few different quotes

94
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,400
from them and share those and explore

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,920
those in a little bit more depth as we

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,239
go through so that's uh that's really

97
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,680
the point of this it's for those of you

98
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,599
who do spend time talking to executives

99
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,920
and board members and uh might like to

100
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,519
see you know what it is that they care

101
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,040
about

102
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
a very short background on me again my

103
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,120
name is brian contos i'm the dp and csa

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
over at mandiant i've been in security

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,159
for about 25 years i've worked uh really

106
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,319
extensively across the world so over 50

107
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,760
countries

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,599
i started with the defense information

109
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,519
systems agency in the us government and

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,200
then bell labs i was actually living in

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
sao paulo brazil for a couple years

112
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,239
while i did that

113
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,680
and then when i came back to the united

114
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,560
states

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,159
i just started building startup

116
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
companies so riptech arcsite imperva

117
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,799
mcafee solaris silence and a whole bunch

118
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,519
of others uh most recently the last

119
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,879
company i helped build was called

120
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
barodan we're required by mandiant i've

121
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,720
written a couple books and i've done

122
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,319
some documentaries and some other things

123
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,760
but let's go ahead and just jump right

124
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,159
into this presentation now

125
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,040
very uh very very short historical

126
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
perspective on threats and technology i

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,478
think it adds some color to this

128
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,720
conversation because it helps frame

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,800
things in terms of our perspectives

130
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,199
also of course i'm sharing conversations

131
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,560
with board members that's kind of the

132
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
meat of this uh hitting on business

133
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,479
relevance because that seems to be

134
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,199
really underscored um with every single

135
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,520
board member i talk to it's it's how is

136
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
what you're telling me from a security

137
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,360
practitioner perspective

138
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,919
important enough for me to put in my

139
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,440
myriad of risks so board members

140
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,680
executives have 10 000 different types

141
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
of risks they deal with

142
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
all day long

143
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
cyber is is just one and while it's a

144
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,960
critical one it has to be factored into

145
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,320
all the other variables and some of

146
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
which might be even more detrimental or

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,199
have a greater impact to the

148
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,320
organization

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,759
and then talking a little bit about some

150
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,199
of the things that are just hot what are

151
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,960
what are what are board members thinking

152
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,039
of in terms of this is this is the tech

153
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,600
that's um we're hearing a lot about we

154
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
care a lot about things like threat

155
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,880
intelligence and incident response

156
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
capabilities and validation and things

157
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,680
like that

158
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,520
so let's just jump right in

159
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,240
um

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
the first thing is shrinking threat

161
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,039
windows and again this is all about

162
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,560
framing perspective

163
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,960
and the way i like to do this is i like

164
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
to look at sea

165
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,600
and air in space and internet and kind

166
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
of those those domains if you will

167
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,240
sometimes people from a military side

168
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
will call them domains of war they'll

169
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,320
add land to that as well but these

170
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
domains are actually domains of

171
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,520
commercialization when were these areas

172
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,759
first commercialized and then when did

173
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,680
those areas first suffer

174
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
at least the first documented uh cases

175
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,479
first suffer some type of threat so in

176
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,880
about 3000 bc in the mediterranean sea

177
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
was our first recorded

178
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,759
um history of people actually using the

179
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,240
c for commerce so somebody basically

180
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
said look we've we've got a bunch of

181
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,199
stuff in a boat why don't we take it

182
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,560
over to this other location and see if

183
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,639
they want to you buy something or trade

184
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,600
something

185
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,199
well it took about 1300 years before we

186
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,479
had the first recorded pirates so 1300

187
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,160
years before somebody said why don't we

188
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
just rob that boat

189
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,840
that's a pretty big threat window

190
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
we generally don't talk about threat

191
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,199
windows like that

192
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
in cyber right but 1300 years pretty big

193
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
but it starts to get smaller

194
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,280
so we take air the first

195
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,960
commercialization of air was in about

196
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,520
1859 it was a hot air balloon uh of

197
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,840
course uh and it was used to transport

198
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,160
mail it was a great idea it crashed and

199
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
burned it literally crashed and burned

200
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,400
it it turned out to be a failure but it

201
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,160
was it was sort of the first step into

202
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,759
that commercialization

203
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,680
we didn't have the first hijacking this

204
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
was actually in peru

205
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,599
uh until 1931 so again not

206
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,479
not 1700 years but still a pretty big

207
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,280
pretty big threat window um and then we

208
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
have go to space

209
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
so the first commercialization that we

210
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
saw in space was just a couple years

211
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,639
after sputnik it was a satellite called

212
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
telstar it was run by att it was for

213
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,840
television broadcasting that was in

214
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,720
1962. now we haven't seen a lot of

215
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,960
attacks in space certainly there's a lot

216
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,039
of discussion amongst governments and

217
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,680
militaries intelligence agencies whatnot

218
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
as it relates to satellite warfare

219
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,840
some of this is academic some of it's

220
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,520
maybe a little bit more than academic

221
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,759
but in terms of cyber criminals trying

222
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,240
to exploit space because of the barrier

223
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
to entry and how satellites and base

224
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
stations generally have a one-to-one

225
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,319
connection um generally the juice isn't

226
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,919
worth the squeeze it's a little too much

227
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,240
effort but with that said we have seen

228
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
some isolated incidents like the trula

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,599
data theft that used command and control

230
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,960
bots uh back in 2015 uh that actually

231
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,199
leveraged commercial satellites so there

232
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,840
has been some documentation of this

233
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,199
finally

234
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
the commercialization of the internet

235
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,280
now there's about a million in one ways

236
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
to talk about when the internet was

237
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,599
actually first commercialized but most

238
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,639
people point to about 1988 people that

239
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
belong to nsfnet had a bunch of users

240
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
using email

241
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,039
or as they called it electronic mail

242
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,680
and then mci had the same thing and they

243
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,520
said hey why don't we charge

244
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,680
our customers and let them email each

245
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
other what a what a concept

246
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,360
but uh pretty much

247
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
right about there 1988 is when we had

248
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
the morris worm which

249
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
exploited our commands and finger and

250
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,120
things like that on unix systems and was

251
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,839
able to really wreak havoc um uh in the

252
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,839
first really prolific worm there was

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,600
attacks before that there was viruses

254
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
both theoretical and application there

255
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
was pc based viruses like the brain and

256
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
other things before this but this was

257
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,279
the first internet based so we've gone

258
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,200
from about 1700 years to really zero and

259
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,399
that's about what we see in on on the uh

260
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,000
on the internet right our threat windows

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,320
are generally very very small so from a

262
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,839
cyber security practitioner's

263
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,440
perspective

264
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,200
we get all excited about this well we've

265
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
got a new threat right there's a there's

266
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,240
a new vulnerability it's a critical it's

267
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,920
a critical cve we've got to address this

268
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,519
we've got to get on it how come the

269
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,200
executive team doesn't understand we got

270
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
to take these things down why isn't the

271
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,120
board acting and again to us it's

272
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,640
critical and to everybody else it should

273
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
be critical as well but it's one of

274
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,720
potentially many other critical factors

275
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
so if you put yourself in the lens of a

276
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,480
board member

277
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
yes we agree this is important but

278
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,920
there's actually five other things that

279
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,519
are even more timely that we have to

280
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,560
address that perhaps you're not aware of

281
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
um and we're seeing technology shift

282
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
advantage pretty quickly if you've ever

283
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,959
seen the movie 300 uh this this picture

284
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,480
will be quite familiar but about 323 bc

285
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
uh the greeks ran the ancient world

286
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,920
right they were

287
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,519
they were the they were the top of the

288
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,320
top

289
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,480
and it was with pretty basic technology

290
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,279
they had bronze and they had iron and

291
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,440
they had these phalanx units with spears

292
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
and they could work very well

293
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
collectively if they were on flat

294
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,640
terrain and they were moving forward

295
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,800
and with that basic technology certainly

296
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,880
very basic by today's standards they

297
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,160
were extremely extremely successful well

298
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
then the romans came around and they had

299
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,640
this new metal called steel and they had

300
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,240
this sword called the gladius sword

301
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
which actually they took from spain just

302
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
a little side note but they said you

303
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
know what why would we fight these

304
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,800
greeks in a straight line on flat

305
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,279
terrain why don't we send a group over

306
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,040
and flank them from the back we'll fight

307
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
him in the woods on the hills and the

308
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,600
rocks

309
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
we'll use guerrilla warfare type

310
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,560
techniques

311
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
and they were very successful so from

312
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
today's perspective wow steel and maybe

313
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,480
not charging head-on into a phalanx unit

314
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
it seems pretty basic

315
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,880
but then it was a massive shift and

316
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,000
advantage

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
and again we're seeing that on the cyber

318
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,519
side both for the bad people that have

319
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,360
nefarious intent and those that are

320
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
trying to stop those with nefarious

321
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
attentions technology is being leveraged

322
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,720
and what was thought to be pretty

323
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,519
advanced tech maybe even

324
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,600
10 15 years ago

325
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
today seemed to be pretty

326
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,279
pretty benign right the attacks and the

327
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,079
uh

328
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,399
the defenses

329
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,360
so we we go a little bit more modern uh

330
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
not that much more modern but a little

331
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,720
bit so we've got a 15th century ottoman

332
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,880
empire so modern-day turkey

333
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,320
and this is really a take on complexity

334
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,399
so

335
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,480
learning to use a longbow

336
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,399
could take years and learning to be

337
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,959
really effective at using a long bow

338
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
could take over a decade so it takes a

339
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,640
long time that's a big investment into

340
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,720
an individual and a group and a part of

341
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
your military to learn how to use the

342
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,839
longboat like we've got this guy here

343
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,600
standing in the middle

344
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,519
now the janissaries did something that's

345
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,760
unique they didn't invent gunpowder and

346
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
they didn't invent the musket and they

347
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
weren't even the first group to use

348
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
muskets in the military but they were

349
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,279
the first ones to embrace it in mass

350
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,279
and they said you know what we can train

351
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,279
somebody how to use a musket and be

352
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,160
pretty effective with that musket in a

353
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
few weeks they might not be the best

354
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,760
shot in the world but if you get enough

355
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,519
of them lined up in a row that's pretty

356
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
darn effective especially when your

357
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,639
enemy is charging you and they've got

358
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,639
leather armor or maybe chainmail and

359
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,240
they've got some shields and they've got

360
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,519
swords and spears and pokey sticks

361
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
they were very very effective so

362
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,720
embracing gun powder bracing the musket

363
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,639
reduced the complexity in the time it

364
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,680
took to train to become effective with

365
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,279
their military and they were highly

366
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,720
highly effective because of this they

367
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
were one of the most effective

368
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
militaries in history

369
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,519
based on again what we would consider

370
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,920
relatively simple technology but

371
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,519
embracing it in a way that reduced the

372
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,120
complexity

373
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
and my final example is this is uh world

374
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,959
war ii

375
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,880
this is a world war ii tiger tank tiger

376
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,320
tanks and panther tanks that were

377
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
developed in germany will sort of be my

378
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
discussion point here but if we go back

379
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
to world war one

380
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,519
um in world war one germany had about 20

381
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,720
tanks

382
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,000
not a lot very few compared to uh with

383
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,720
the us and france and england and others

384
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,440
had so extremely small number but they

385
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
saw during world war one how effective

386
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,519
tanks could be not that they really

387
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,040
embraced that significantly in world war

388
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
one they weren't they were there they

389
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,079
were effective but it wasn't wasn't like

390
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,600
the janissaries with their with their

391
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,720
muskets

392
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
by the time world war ii came around

393
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
they had built

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,680
in a very secret way

395
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,800
these

396
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,399
tanks well

397
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,160
the thing that they did that was

398
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
interesting is these were extremely

399
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,800
extremely advanced pieces of machinery

400
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,199
far more advanced than what the us had

401
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,920
built with our m4 sherman tanks

402
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,519
what russia was building and what others

403
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,000
were creating it was super advanced it

404
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
was like a finely tuned clock on paper

405
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,920
the problem was it took a long time to

406
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
train somebody to operate one of these

407
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,399
tanks that was the first issue a u.s m4

408
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,560
sherman tank if you could drive a car

409
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,160
you could drive a tank

410
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,240
same thing in russia sometimes the

411
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,600
people that were actually driving the

412
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,279
tanks and fighting were the people that

413
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,720
actually built those tanks a couple

414
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,000
months before

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
at least later in world war ii that was

416
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,959
the case

417
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,160
but the problem too with these tanks was

418
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,600
that not only was it hard to train

419
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,639
people but supply chain problems so if

420
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,639
the tank gets broken which tanks tend to

421
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,880
do things fall apart things get

422
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,360
shot at and blown up and fall apart

423
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
they didn't have the manpower and the

424
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
capabilities to supply that supply chain

425
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,360
to fix those so even though it was much

426
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,279
much more advanced it was way better

427
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,120
than any tanks built by the us or

428
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,320
anybody else

429
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,519
in operations it was a failure because

430
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,120
of the complexity of training and

431
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,639
because of the broken supply chain and

432
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,760
they were not able to support it

433
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,160
so with that and kind of giving you

434
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,760
different perspectives on different

435
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
things again a very short history if you

436
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,760
will let's jump into our first quote

437
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,720
here

438
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
and this quote

439
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,760
is by uh art coviello and arco yellow

440
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
some of you may have heard of him or

441
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,279
maybe even know him he's been a mentor

442
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,639
of mine for many years but art was the

443
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,880
former president and ceo for rsa

444
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,000
security uh but he also sits on a huge

445
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,440
number i could i couldn't even list him

446
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,199
on the slide number of boards especially

447
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,639
in the technology

448
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,959
um in the security space and he's also

449
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,320
on the board of a publicly traded

450
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
financial services company so he has a

451
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,639
really broad perspective on sort of

452
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,720
what boards think

453
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,399
um and he says and i'll just read these

454
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,839
quotes

455
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,079
all companies big or small public or

456
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,240
private must embrace cyber security as a

457
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,959
key issue okay we get that

458
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,720
with today's threat landscape if you

459
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
don't you're not meeting your fiduciary

460
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
responsibility

461
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,920
and i i really love this quote for the

462
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
fact that it just kind of boils it down

463
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,000
to the most simplistic perspective look

464
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
it doesn't matter who you are you have

465
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
to care about it and if you're not

466
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,920
taking time to consider it you're not

467
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,600
doing the most basic thing that you do

468
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,199
as a board member which is your

469
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,680
fiduciary responsibility to making sure

470
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
that the company uh isn't hemorrhaging

471
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
money and they're investing in the right

472
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,639
places

473
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,639
this is really key because i think if

474
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,800
you went back even as short as five six

475
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,199
years ago this wasn't necessarily the

476
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,560
perspective

477
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
and certainly a lot of board members

478
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,759
would they're they're not security

479
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,160
experts a lot of them aren't even uh

480
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
that really tech savvy if you will um

481
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,759
but to have somebody that's been in the

482
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,920
game this long to have that perspective

483
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,360
and say look this is this is what you

484
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,120
have to do it's really a powerful thing

485
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
so it addresses i think the initial

486
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,279
question that some people have is do

487
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,440
boards really care about or should they

488
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,240
really care about cyber security and

489
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
plain and simple the answer is yes yes

490
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,199
in fact they

491
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,800
should so

492
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,160
one of the things that i took away from

493
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
these conversations as well is

494
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
security isn't really about cyber risk

495
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,320
for these these uh these board members

496
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
and that seems like a weird thing to say

497
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,759
it's like saying security is not about

498
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,559
security uh but let me dive into that

499
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,520
for them security a cyber risk

500
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,400
is about the financial the brand and the

501
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
operational risk that can occur from a

502
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
cyber attack not the cyber risk and of

503
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,559
itself

504
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,160
and and that seems like a very simple

505
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,079
thing of course they care about

506
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,880
finance brand and operational risk but

507
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,720
oftentimes i'm told and this goes back

508
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,200
to the sarlacc pit comment that

509
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
csos and other security executives don't

510
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,760
approach the conversation from the

511
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,840
financial brand and the operational risk

512
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,919
they talk about look how prolific this

513
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,559
new bot is or look what type of impact

514
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,120
this ransomware can have on us or

515
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,960
because we don't have incident

516
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
prevention controls in this part of our

517
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,559
network we're at this level of risk

518
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,559
instead of talking about well what's the

519
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
financial the brand and operational risk

520
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,280
from that cyber attack now we know ceos

521
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,720
care about this

522
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
we know board members care about this

523
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
because we're even talking about on the

524
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,120
news

525
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,799
i'm seeing this around the world a lot

526
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,799
of board members a lot of ceos will be

527
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
on the news they'll be interviewed and

528
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,760
cyber is brought up and they're

529
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,960
discussing it

530
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,480
but more important than just showing up

531
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,840
on the news which is nice because you

532
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,120
never heard them talk about it on the

533
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,200
news before is you're seeing cyber

534
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
security mentioned in annual reports

535
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
corporate governance documents and

536
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
committee charters these are all their

537
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
legal publicly available documents that

538
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,000
they have to share with shareholders and

539
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,480
stakeholders right and within them let's

540
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,640
take an oil company for example

541
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,559
oil companies have to worry about a ton

542
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,919
of things everything else that every

543
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,160
other business has to worry about plus

544
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,039
environmental issues uh military and

545
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,640
political issues

546
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
issues perhaps related to terrorists

547
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,039
and the list can go on and on and guess

548
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,480
what another bullet

549
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,240
cyber and cyber can actually have a real

550
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,320
impact on their organization what they

551
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,799
call a material risk which is a risk

552
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
that actually can have

553
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720
financial impact in the organization

554
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,679
um the other thing that we're seeing is

555
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,360
as security practitioners we've been

556
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,880
saying we need to see it at the board

557
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
table we need to see it at the board

558
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
table for probably far longer than i've

559
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,679
been doing this and i've been doing this

560
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,600
for a while

561
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,919
well now we have it their ears are open

562
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,600
their eyes are open they're listening

563
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,679
they're watching they want to see it

564
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,120
but they want to make sure that you're

565
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,360
measuring how effective your security

566
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,760
controls are like other businesses

567
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,160
measure how effective they are so if you

568
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,880
think of the chief financial officer

569
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,320
if the ceo asks the cfo how much money

570
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,559
do we have in the bank and the answer is

571
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,440
well we do pen testing we follow pci we

572
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,600
do best best practices we just did a

573
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,520
vulnerability scan we did this it's kind

574
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,840
of a wishy-washy answer it's like ros

575
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,679
site return on security investments it's

576
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,200
about reducing risk

577
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,320
um

578
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,600
they're probably not going to be the cfo

579
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,120
very long they just want to hear that

580
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,559
hey we've got 5 million dollars in the

581
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,320
bank and last week we had three million

582
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,840
so i guess we're doing better and

583
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
security they want the same thing they

584
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,120
want to know do you have a way to

585
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
measure how well our security controls

586
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
are doing across endpoint and email and

587
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
network and cloud and prevention

588
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,799
detection and response and all these

589
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,120
disparate areas can you actually can you

590
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,799
actually measure it and can you trend

591
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,159
and just show if we're doing better or

592
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,360
not like the vp of sales like the chief

593
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,120
financial officer like the chief

594
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,360
operation officer again security has now

595
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,600
become strategic you have to speak like

596
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,080
you're a strategic member of the team

597
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,679
and finally and this is something i just

598
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,440
wanted to throw in here because i

599
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,039
interviewed a very large number of csos

600
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,919
and they were talking about their

601
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,960
conversations with not only the uh the

602
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,559
board but with um the ceo cfo and the

603
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,559
rest of the executive team

604
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,960
and this kind of bubbled out as like the

605
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,120
six basic priorities that they care

606
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,000
about

607
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
and i think most people on this call

608
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
would look at these as just the really

609
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,720
bare bones basic but again this is the

610
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,159
mindset this is what they're thinking

611
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,760
about they're not thinking about you

612
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
know the specifics of a new ransomware

613
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,919
attack or some new vulnerability they're

614
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,840
thinking in these broad strokes so what

615
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,919
are the six priorities securing

616
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,760
communication channels like email i want

617
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,679
to be able to send emails safely

618
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,919
protecting my financial systems and my

619
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,520
customer data and my intellectual

620
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,679
property of course i have to protect all

621
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,600
my data especially those financial

622
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,960
systems and customer data and

623
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,799
intellectual property

624
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,640
a sharing availability of my critical

625
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,400
apps in the infrastructure okay i got to

626
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,919
protect it i got to make sure people can

627
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,600
get to it i have to make sure that the

628
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,200
infrastructure that supports those

629
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,120
systems whether it's in the cloud or

630
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
it's a sas solution or on-prem that it's

631
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,559
secure as well

632
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,480
safeguarding access not only do i want

633
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,679
it up and running but i want to make

634
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,159
sure i can control who who can get in

635
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
and then demonstrating compliance so

636
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,280
placating auditors checking the box but

637
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
hopefully not just saying yes we pass

638
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,039
the audit but using the investment and

639
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,799
time and resources that we put into that

640
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,480
audit to make sure that we're actually

641
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,440
getting

642
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,080
real security value

643
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,480
this next quote is from alexa king she's

644
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,240
a very interesting board member because

645
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,200
she's actually a lawyer and

646
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
in addition to being a lawyer and being

647
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
an executive vice president for a tech

648
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,559
company she actually sits on boards as

649
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,039
well so she kind of has another unique

650
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,120
perspective as they all really do

651
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,880
and she says if you provide boards with

652
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,400
evidence-based data

653
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,919
and that's important i should have

654
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,840
bolded that evidence-based data that's

655
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,640
key

656
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,120
regarding your cyber security posture

657
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,320
trends intelligence effectiveness etc

658
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,240
they should be able to provide you with

659
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
valuable input based on their broader

660
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,039
perspective

661
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,039
i really like this quote

662
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,720
because she's saying it's not just

663
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
unidirectional this is bi-directional

664
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,960
communication you're giving information

665
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,159
to the board but hopefully they're

666
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,080
giving you information back and they're

667
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,000
saying yeah this is this is important

668
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
but please also consider that we're

669
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
looking at opening up an office in asia

670
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,440
or we're looking at acquiring this other

671
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
company or we're looking at divesting

672
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
this this region

673
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,960
these are things that you might not have

674
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,320
been aware of but things that you can

675
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,200
take away so it's not just going up and

676
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,360
presenting it's having that that open

677
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,200
bi-directional line of communication to

678
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,960
be able to get things back and leverage

679
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,039
it they want to trust me they want to be

680
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,120
able to share their expertise that's why

681
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,880
they're there one of the biggest values

682
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,559
of having board members they sit on lots

683
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,480
of boards they see and hear lots of

684
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,000
things they have a much broader

685
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
perspective which is why they're on the

686
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
board than the person that actually has

687
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,760
to operate the company and do security

688
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,679
for the company so

689
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,520
very good input should be bidirectional

690
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
again evidence-based of course she's a

691
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,919
lawyer so she would say evidence-based

692
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,799
but having evidence having proof there's

693
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,520
there's no room for guesswork there's no

694
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
room for assumptions at this level when

695
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,039
you're talking to the board they want to

696
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
hear all the good things but you have to

697
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,640
also share all the bad things and you

698
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,000
have to show them the supporting

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,600
evidence the proof of where you're

700
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,760
getting this it can't just be high-level

701
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,000
conversations about you know what you're

702
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,360
hearing or what you're seeing or what

703
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,200
the potential threat might be you need

704
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,320
metrics at this level

705
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
business relevance again this was

706
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,799
underscored many times as a key concept

707
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,520
so things such as across all industries

708
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,120
we know that

709
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,279
they rely on on critical assets to

710
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,440
generate revenue to be competitive to

711
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,799
deliver services all these other things

712
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,480
significant investments are made to

713
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,159
ensure that these systems stay up they

714
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,760
stay running in business continuity

715
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,559
people have access to data and customers

716
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,559
regulatory compliance again hopefully

717
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,720
going beyond the placation of auditors

718
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
but actually getting value from this

719
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
critical asset protection making sure

720
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,520
that those key assets are actually

721
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,159
um being safeguarded and a lot of times

722
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:31,760
we'll use oil and gas as example you

723
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
have these old windows nt4o machines

724
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,919
that have been end of life for years but

725
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,159
they still in some cases decades they

726
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,679
still operate multi-million dollar

727
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,760
turbines or pumps or they control flow

728
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,840
or temperature things of this nature you

729
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,600
need to have systems that protect those

730
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,400
systems

731
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,720
so think of it as that onion approach so

732
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,320
they really care about that keeping the

733
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,400
business running and finally the biggest

734
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,760
one i think is rationalization

735
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,919
optimization i'm now starting to see

736
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,679
teams that have like a vp of security

737
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,279
rationalization or security

738
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,600
rationalization teams that their only

739
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,159
uh purpose is actually to be able to

740
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,279
determine

741
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,120
that money that we just spent a hundred

742
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,960
thousand dollars on for security are we

743
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,000
actually getting a hundred thousand

744
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,480
dollars of value from that have we

745
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,400
actually optimized what we find in

746
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,960
general is people get maybe 20 30 of the

747
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,880
value from their security controls not

748
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
because they have bad people or bad

749
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
products or bad processes they've just

750
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,080
never had tools in place to validate and

751
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,279
make sure that they're actually getting

752
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,120
value from those tools historically

753
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,400
there's tools like breach and attack

754
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,120
simulation security validation that can

755
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,640
can help with those steps to make sure

756
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
that you're actually getting value you

757
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,919
can measure that value and you're

758
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,400
optimizing those systems and that again

759
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,960
ties into business relevance

760
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,039
this gentleman is jay lee jaylee

761
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,200
probably sits on more cyber security

762
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,880
company boards than anybody i

763
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
interviewed um

764
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
he was also the former cso for

765
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,480
blackstone a very very large financial

766
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,799
services company and he said boards and

767
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,240
business executives can generally

768
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,320
quantify risks brought on by economic

769
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,799
downturns political changes natural

770
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,919
disasters but understanding preparedness

771
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,080
and impact analysis from cyber is often

772
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,240
based on assumptions because of a lack

773
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,000
of evidence-based measures there's

774
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,159
evidence based again right representing

775
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,760
the effectiveness of your cybersecurity

776
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
controls so once again jay is

777
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,600
underscoring the fact that

778
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
assumption-based security doesn't work

779
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,919
you need to measure on evidence and

780
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,080
again if you're talking to a board it

781
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,000
all has to be evidence-based they want

782
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,080
facts they don't want ideas or gut

783
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,159
feelings those are all valuable those

784
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,080
all help they don't go away for sure

785
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,480
they make you valuable as an operator

786
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,159
but at a board level you need to be able

787
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,559
to present facts

788
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,159
some of the common security findings

789
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,320
that reduce value that we're finding

790
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,480
across the board and i think a lot of

791
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,240
you would notice this that sort of make

792
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
it so controls aren't optimized which is

793
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,919
a big thing again optimization and

794
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,679
rationalization we're finding that

795
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,880
there's a lot of weak out of the box

796
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,760
configurations like default configs

797
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,440
somebody installed something during the

798
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,760
poc it turned into a production product

799
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,360
whether it was the vendor or a partner

800
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
your own internal team

801
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
but it was just the default config which

802
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,279
probably isn't right for you

803
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,840
misconfiguration of existing controls a

804
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,159
lot of times we find that

805
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,360
networks that were supposed to be

806
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,760
segmented aren't segmented we're finding

807
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,279
that security controls that were thought

808
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,399
to be in place aren't actually in place

809
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,559
and sometimes it's a lack of resources

810
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,320
to post deployment so something's been

811
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,360
deployed

812
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,440
you kind of get it working but there's

813
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,799
so many things that you need to care

814
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,559
about you you kind of switch gears and

815
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,480
that's just left operate most companies

816
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,320
we run into have somewhere between 50

817
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,559
and 200 different security vendors

818
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,720
within their organization that's a huge

819
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,880
number of things to be first just to be

820
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,799
able to keep it running let alone to

821
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,720
optimize it and have the risk metrics

822
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,080
and make sure it's actually doing what

823
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,520
it's supposed to be doing it's very very

824
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
challenging

825
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,679
i mentioned the segmentation flaws as

826
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,440
well but one of the big issues we also

827
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,840
see are sim so sim's a huge investment i

828
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,760
spent about uh almost seven years at

829
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,679
arcsight from the early days when sim

830
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,200
was just becoming a thing and we didn't

831
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,039
even really call it some back then to

832
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,399
when we took our site public and

833
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,240
eventually got bought by hewlett-packard

834
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,919
so i got to kind of see the evolution of

835
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,320
it and sim is like this super set of

836
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,080
everything else that's under you has to

837
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,440
work properly

838
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,679
the the ntp has to work you have to be

839
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,679
getting your logs i t stuck a proxy

840
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,720
server now you're not getting your

841
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,799
assist logs right somebody that was

842
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,480
supposed to have a bi-directional tap

843
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,640
for an ips accidentally configured as

844
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,399
unidirectional so the ips drops

845
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,399
everything there's a zillion things that

846
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,679
can go wrong

847
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,840
reporting to the sim before you start

848
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,399
doing sim stuff correlation volumetric

849
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,640
analysis temporal analysis pattern

850
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,679
discovery anomaly detection on and on so

851
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,440
we a lot of times we see that even

852
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,880
before you get the information to the

853
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
sim it's wrong and then once you do get

854
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,640
it to the sim if you really have a way

855
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
to test that this very advanced rule

856
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,679
that you've written or this

857
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,600
correlational alert is actually going to

858
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,440
work so again that's where tools like

859
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,880
breach and attack simulation and

860
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
security validation

861
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,679
come in uh this is matt biggie matt

862
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,679
biggie was a former um

863
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,799
us army air force or us army ranger

864
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,880
um he's also a partner at crossland

865
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,039
capital he sits again on many many

866
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,120
boards but his military background adds

867
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,360
some color to his interview he says

868
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,039
audit committees evaluate a wide range

869
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,080
of risks

870
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,159
from standardized accounting practices

871
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,480
to the composition of boards

872
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,679
are

873
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,600
in cyber security historically the audit

874
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,039
committees have lack controls

875
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,880
effectiveness evidence

876
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
validation measures against threat

877
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,559
intelligence and optimization metrics

878
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,480
for incident analysis and response

879
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
capabilities so what i really want to

880
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,240
hit there is the fact that he's saying

881
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,559
look it's not enough even to say are my

882
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,000
controls effective or not and i'm

883
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,840
measuring how will this

884
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,679
this tool work

885
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,760
or if i run this attack in my network

886
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,679
will it be blocked will it be detected

887
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,520
will i be alerted upon will my people

888
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,679
know what to do will the processes work

889
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,200
but now i want to do that against all

890
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,120
the latest threat intel as well so i'm

891
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,080
getting all this great threat

892
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,840
intelligence i need to operationalize it

893
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
so i can automate it and test it i need

894
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,600
to personalize it so i want to test it

895
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,440
in my environment i want to safely

896
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,960
execute these real attacks that i'm

897
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,760
getting these iocs and these ttps within

898
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,679
my environment to see how my products

899
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,640
and my people and how my processes will

900
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,960
act under this you know do we block do

901
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,039
we respond do we detect how will this

902
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,120
happen and then give me the facts

903
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,640
this is how good we were at doing this

904
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,399
last month this is how good we're doing

905
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,080
it this month this is how good we are

906
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,840
doing it against this very specific

907
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,399
attack right and i think again that's

908
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,840
that level of visibility that

909
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,600
organizations are looking for

910
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,960
and they're looking for security that's

911
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
done not just better but different and

912
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,480
by that what i mean it's not the next

913
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,200
next firewall the next next ips the next

914
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,360
next sim it's actually taking a step

915
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,960
back and saying how can i take the

916
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,760
things i've got and make them better so

917
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,799
identify a gap for example in my system

918
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,720
if i do have a gap using breach and

919
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,960
attack simulation or security validation

920
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,440
type tools tell me how to tune that then

921
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,000
once i've tuned it let me re-test with

922
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
that attack to see if my security

923
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,159
controls are preventing are detecting

924
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,360
our alerting

925
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
and then let me go ahead to avoid

926
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,640
environmental drift let me automate this

927
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,320
so now i got this information from

928
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,600
thread intel

929
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,120
i found out that i've got some systems

930
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,640
that are vulnerable to it

931
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,120
i tune my system i test it now again

932
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,559
against that threat until and it says

933
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,919
okay you're secure you're preventing

934
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,240
detecting responding now i want to test

935
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,200
it every single day in perpetuity

936
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,279
with a 10 000 other different attacks to

937
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,559
make sure that that thing that was

938
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,039
blocking or detecting or responding and

939
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,360
alerting is now still doing it next week

940
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,880
and next month the next quarter next

941
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,840
year

942
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,760
by doing that i can start rationalizing

943
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,960
i can start saying you know what we need

944
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,880
to invest over here or we need to

945
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,640
prioritize this over this because i know

946
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,559
what's not working and what is working

947
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,919
i'm going way beyond traditional

948
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,279
vulnerability scanning or patch

949
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,960
management this is a great way to

950
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,440
augment that i can very easily map my

951
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,919
capabilities to miter attack or nist

952
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,600
sands owasps

953
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,279
and report and demonstrate the value

954
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,799
that my security team is providing

955
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,559
this is bill kroll so bill crowe was the

956
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,120
former deputy director for the nsa he

957
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,279
was with the nsa for about 35 years so

958
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,279
he knows a lot about threat intelligence

959
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,120
bill and i actually wrote a book a few

960
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,760
years back as well so he's just a very

961
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,720
very smart person he sits on a number of

962
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
boards and of course he brings all that

963
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,200
intelligence agency background with him

964
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,360
and he says having an intelligence led

965
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,120
approach to cyber security doesn't make

966
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,039
your security team doesn't just make

967
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,880
your security team more effective it

968
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,039
provides the evidence leadership needs

969
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,200
there's evidence again to ensure that

970
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
your goals and objectives and priorities

971
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,159
are aligned with their business

972
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,840
requirements in the face of the latest

973
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,519
relevant threat actors so an

974
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,360
intelligence led again and we saw

975
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,200
intelligence mentioned before

976
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,720
taking that rich intel that you're

977
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,200
getting from all your disparate sources

978
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,799
operationalizing it so you can

979
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,440
automatically test now iocs and ttps

980
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,480
within your environment to see what's

981
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,399
what am i able to prevent if this got

982
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,399
into my environment can i stop it from

983
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,080
exfiltrating data does it uh compress

984
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,840
information and does it

985
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,919
sort of leak it out via

986
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,640
icmp for example or does it create a ssh

987
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,320
tunnel and what my devices do if it

988
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,559
can't see it how my people react so

989
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,000
having an intelligence line instead of

990
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,320
intelligence being sort of this

991
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,919
late indicator of compromise that you

992
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,919
used for forensic analysis you're

993
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,200
actually putting it at the tip of the

994
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,240
spear

995
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,760
so you're validating all your security

996
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,840
controls against that intel that is the

997
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,760
new new and that seems to be really top

998
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,080
of mind uh threat until for for these

999
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,679
board members

1000
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,360
again threat intelligence as i said

1001
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,880
being the tip of the spear it's all

1002
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,960
about making it relevant so you can

1003
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,880
really focus where your security spend

1004
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,600
is against not just the the old stodgy

1005
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,240
sql attacks and uh you know command and

1006
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,919
control type issues and things like that

1007
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,360
we still want to test for that because

1008
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,279
it still works everybody here knows that

1009
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,039
a sql injection attack that worked 20

1010
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,880
years ago unfortunately can sometimes

1011
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,640
still work today but you also want to

1012
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,720
test against this latest attack too even

1013
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,559
if it's simple stuff like are do i have

1014
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,000
a device beaconing to these known

1015
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,200
malicious ip addresses and domains

1016
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,960
here's karen norman karen ortman sits

1017
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
again on a number of boards

1018
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
cyber security company boards of course

1019
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,879
and technology companies and her

1020
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,719
perspective was really companies are

1021
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,560
embracing cyber security services at

1022
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,079
increasing rate and i won't read the

1023
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,800
whole quote but cara's whole perspective

1024
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,399
is look it's great to have all these

1025
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,359
tools

1026
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,440
and security tools and test them with

1027
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,719
breach and attack and security

1028
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,199
validation and pull threat intelligence

1029
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,000
academically yes this makes sense

1030
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,480
but not everybody has the human

1031
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,560
resources and the expertise to do this

1032
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,639
effectively so her perspective on it was

1033
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,760
very simple

1034
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,679
look guys you need to embrace services

1035
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,040
whether it's managed services or

1036
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,800
augmenting your team with incident

1037
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,879
responders or what have you this is

1038
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,480
going to be really key as we go forward

1039
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,599
because you're not going to be able to

1040
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,199
be as effective

1041
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,000
without sort of having a third party you

1042
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,719
know

1043
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,359
on retainer or consulting services there

1044
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,879
just isn't enough time in the day

1045
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,320
because of the operational constraints

1046
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,920
of most people so we're seeing more

1047
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,839
people embracing those services and

1048
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,920
security teams now having to learn how

1049
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,800
to manage these outsourced services

1050
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
more effectively

1051
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,720
and final thoughts as we wrap up here

1052
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,520
again security has become strategically

1053
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,920
extremely strategic luckily we do have

1054
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,079
the ear of the c-suite and the board but

1055
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,079
unfortunately a number of cisos are

1056
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,760
still talking about assumption-based

1057
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,839
security what they think is happening

1058
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,440
what might occur instead of

1059
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,200
evidence-based hence they're falling

1060
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,359
into that sarlacc pit and it's not just

1061
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,200
about tools it's about the intelligence

1062
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,119
and the people behind those tools and

1063
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,880
validation is one way to make sure your

1064
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,640
security tools are working reach an

1065
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,480
attack simulation is another you can

1066
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,320
also leverage various security services

1067
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,599
and pen tests which will at least give

1068
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,760
you a snapshot it's better than nothing

1069
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,520
but there's a way to automate this and

1070
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,280
finally at the end of the day where you

1071
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,760
want to get based on these csos is

1072
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,320
measurable value measurable roi that you

1073
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,240
can actually communicate to them now if

1074
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,920
you'd like to see any of these podcast

1075
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,000
interviews each one's like 30 to 60

1076
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,200
minutes long

1077
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,720
you can find the cybersecurity effect on

1078
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,079
this podcast on spotify or itunes on our

1079
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,320
website wherever it is you'd uh like to

1080
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,839
listen to podcasts

1081
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,079
and with that i think i'm at time so

1082
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,440
thank you so much everybody i really

1083
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
appreciate giving me the opportunity to

1084
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,960
speak today

1085
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,440
so much for this perspective oh i just

1086
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,400
want to

1087
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
shoot one very small question your way

1088
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
because you talked about about this

1089
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,240
bi-directional communication between

1090
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,000
board members and the cyber security

1091
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,480
experts who do the execution of

1092
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,040
strategy um why do you think it breaks

1093
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,280
down is it jargon is it the lack of

1094
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,440
knowledge is it pre-existing biases on

1095
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,800
both sides

1096
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,920
i think you're right on all those

1097
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,599
accounts every board member and every

1098
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,119
cso or security team is a little bit

1099
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,400
different as as security practitioners

1100
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,000
sometimes we don't realize how much we

1101
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,400
get bogged into our own jargon

1102
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,079
we certainly don't realize how much we

1103
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,400
get very laser focused on specific

1104
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,680
attacks or issues we're trying to

1105
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,599
mitigate especially the latest hottest

1106
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,280
thing that's all over the boards and all

1107
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,520
over the news and again board members

1108
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,960
need to step back and they're looking at

1109
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,640
things in terms of how relevant is this

1110
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,800
to the business so having that open

1111
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,480
communication we have to continue to

1112
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,720
educate but we have to educate them in a

1113
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
language that they speak we can't expect

1114
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,560
them to understand us we need to speak

1115
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,640
in a way that they'll understand and i'm

1116
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,880
seeing a lot of security executives now

1117
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,040
going through business training some

1118
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,079
have come up through technical

1119
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,839
backgrounds or different processes they

1120
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,119
might not have all the soft business

1121
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,800
skills spending a little time learning

1122
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,040
that can actually be very helpful as you

1123
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,880
climb that ladder

1124
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,320
yeah that makes a lot of sense and i

1125
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,560
guess it it works both ways right we all

1126
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,800
got to be good at recognizing when we're

1127
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
speaking jargon and when we're speaking

1128
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,440
human right yes absolutely

1129
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,200
thank you so much for your presentation

1130
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,119
and for your presence here at deaf camp

1131
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,280
it definitely made the first day and on

1132
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,960
a very high note

1133
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,119
um thank you this was a pleasure
