1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,960
so this this next guest of ours uh

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,640
raphael

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,359
is a c-shirt and pen testing team leader

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,440
at sydica and uh he will talk to us

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,360
about something that i believe is very

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,360
important not just as a principles but

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,520
also when you actually get to apply it

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,600
which is working with boundaries and

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,480
figuring out how to make the most impact

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,680
and also kind of building that muscle

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,800
that helps you prioritize which is such

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,760
a crucial skill in this field rafael

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,600
thank you for joining us welcome to

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,399
death camp we're excited to

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,200
um have your presentation to to listen

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,960
to it to learn from you so thanks so

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,000

for sitting tight and as always you know

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,320
things happen but uh collaboration makes

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,079
technology work at the end of the day so

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
rafael thank you so much for hanging on

thank you uh andrew

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,880
good afternoon death camp i'm very glad

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,360
to be here uh a big thank you to the

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
organization for setting up this event

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,320
and

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,880
for switching it to a virtual setting um

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,720
you see this brings a lot of uh

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
difficulties but uh as andre already

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,400
indicated uh

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,960
together we will generally find a way to

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
get things going

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,439
so also thank you for for joining this

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,000
talk um today i'll be talking about how

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,240
to leverage threat intelligence

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,920
in the the selection and privatization

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,840
of detection sources

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
um maybe a very quick who am i

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
uh my name is rafael i've already been

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
introduced i'm the sister and fantastic

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,720
team leader at ceja

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,320
i in terms of education i hold a master

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,159
not very typically in applied economic

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,560
sciences um i've followed a lot of

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
trainings along the years and in idea

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,640
and security fields from vendor

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,040
trainings and microsoft cisco uh

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
forensics spend testing development

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
scripting etc

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,119
also did crisis management trainings uh

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,038
because that was a big part of

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,360
the first half of my time at my previous

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,760
job i hold a couple of certificates the

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
mandatory cissp

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,160
for uh to open hr doors i hold some gx

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,760
certifications

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,000
as you can see here in the slide and in

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
terms of experience um i started started

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
out as an independent id and security

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
service provider for small and medium

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,760
enterprises

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,599
i did that for about two years and then

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,200
i moved on to a consultancy role at bmp

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
barbara fortis a large western european

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,120
bank

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,400
where i spent a year in it

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,720
then about six and a half years in

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,400
search related activities

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
so uh idea and security incident and

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
crisis management and then i went on to

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
about five years of building and leading

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
the c circuit in the global security

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,560
division of that bank

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,879
and now uh since about a year i've moved

79
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
uh well a little over a year now i've

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,800
moved to siege

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,920
uh

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
an mssp where i'm leading the c-cert and

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,000
fantastic teams

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,840
what's the problem that i want to

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,840
discuss with you today

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
um both in my previous job so both at

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,480
the at the bank the bmp by before this

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
where i used to work and now uh at siege

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
where i'm confronted with a myriad of

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,239
different customers

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,519
there is a

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,879
recurring

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,640
question that arises each time we're

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
setting up a security monitoring or a

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,799
detection and response service

96
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,040
all of these organizations have

97
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,879
usually a wide array of potential

98
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,519
detection sources they have system logs

99
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,200
from all the systems in their network

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
they go from windows event logs some

101
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
some companies already added sysmon on

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,959
top they have linux servers uh with a

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,280
lot of interesting log files in there

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,200
for our log file system

105
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
there are security control logs from

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
active directory over anti-virus edr

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,200
firewalls ids ips web application

108
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
firewalls clouds uh solutions like a lot

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,040
of the the typical cloud providers are

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
now offering for example microsoft has

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,918
specific cloud security controls for

112
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,639
their uh cloud setups

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,880
and then the the higher profile uh

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,800
high confidentiality organizations like

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
for example banks they usually also have

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
file integrity monitoring and more

117
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,840
advanced more uh

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,960
granular security controls as well

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,320
on top of that there's the other ones

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,400
that are not necessarily security

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
related you have network logs and

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
statistics

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320
like dns for example or like netflow

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,520
data

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
cloud logs and statistics we all know

126
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,600
the cloud apps that are

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
registering

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,199
where we're connecting or authenticating

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,759
from what devices we are using what what

130
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,840
time frame we are logging in usually

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
this is generally coupled with machine

132
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,840
learning to to establish a baseline and

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,560
i

134
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
identify outlying behavior

135
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,680
there's also application logs both from

136
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
externally developed and internally

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
developed

138
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
applications

139
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
and on top of that

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
the mssps and vendors in the field are

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,199
offering a huge amount of possibilities

142
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
to add detection sources on top of that

143
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,720
the problem today is we can not

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,639
implement them all in a timely and in a

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,160
cost-effective manner we need to make

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
choices um

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
there is uh

148
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
so far i haven't met a company that has

149
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,080
an unlimited budget an unlimited amount

150
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,280
of people an

151
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
unlimited amount of time to implement

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
something

153
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,120
so uh we need to take this into account

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
and then the question arises which of

155
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,440
these detection sources will we select

156
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
and which ones will we implement first

157
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
on even so that's a selection and

158
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
prioritization of those detection

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,639
sources that i want to talk about today

160
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,960
that's the problem uh now it's a

161
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
solution

162
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
i think uh uh an important uh solution

163
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
here is to

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,639
increase the effort that we're building

165
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,120
in an activity that's uh

166
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
generally referred to as threat modeling

167
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,000
uh trap modeling is slowly becoming a

168
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
bit of a buzzword i think it's maybe not

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
the most popular one but it's just

170
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,800
one that i hear often and a lot of

171
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,039
people are now talking about it but if

172
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,560
you are actually doing it a lot of

173
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,039
people have wild theories about how you

174
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,479
could do trap modeling and this

175
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,319
generally ends up in very complex

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,360
approaches uh very difficult to uh to

177
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
put in motion very costly also

178
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,919
but i think we can keep this type of

179
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,520
activity this type of initiative

180
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,840
relatively simple as well

181
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,240
and so in that spirit i i've tried to

182
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,120
condense it in a definition to reflect

183
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
that that straightforward approach that

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
i want to um that i want to present to

185
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
you guys today

186
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
so i came up with leveraging internal

187
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,440
and external threat intelligence sources

188
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,400
to identify

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,759
threats that are relevant to the

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,599
organization the organization for which

191
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
we are creating the threat profile

192
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,759
as well as the tactics techniques and

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,840
procedures the ttps that are used by

194
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,560
these threat actors

195
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,080
so all good but

196
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,639
if it's that simple how do we do it well

197
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,000
first of all let's have a look at the

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,240
different intelligence sources uh that

199
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,919
we can take into account as i said in

200
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,440
the previous slide there's external and

201
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,080
internal threat intelligence sources the

202
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,919
most important one and that i think that

203
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,039
nowadays

204
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,360
nearly everyone knows uh and the one

205
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,639
that don't know it very well i've

206
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,240
certainly heard about it is the mitra

207
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,400
attack framework

208
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
uh for the ones that don't know it or

209
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,080
don't know it very well i will explain

210
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,400
in the next slide very quickly uh what

211
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
it uh what its

212
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
purpose is

213
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,680
there's also a lot of external threat

214
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,479
intelligence providers you have paid

215
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,479
threat intelligence providers

216
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,879
we all know some names like recorded

217
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,720
future for example big organizations

218
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,400
that are specializing in threat

219
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,879
intelligence that are uh providing this

220
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,400
as a service to

221
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,960
both customers directly and via mssps

222
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,840
but there's also free

223
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,280
uh threatened thousands fees that are

224
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
providing uh ttps and iocs for example

225
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,160
in the form of threat intel fees that

226
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,560
you can then onboard in free and open

227
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,440
source platforms like miss for example

228
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,680
um there's blogs and articles the

229
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,840
internet is full of them the vendors do

230
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,639
it

231
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
cyber security rockstars have their own

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
blogs now where they are

233
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,440
presenting all of their findings or

234
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
or writing about all of their

235
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
experiences

236
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,799
and last but not least there's academic

237
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,880
research which is also very interesting

238
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,959
because it's generally not under such

239
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,640
budget and time pressure as as

240
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,399
commercial initiatives are

241
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,279
and

242
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,760
academic researchers often go into a

243
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
more

244
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
theoretical but also a more

245
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,600
a

246
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
more in-depth approach

247
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,800
in their

248
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,680
research and their investigations

249
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,200
now next to that there's also internal

250
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,839
threat intelligence services and

251
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,160
i think that for most organizations

252
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
historical incidents are the most

253
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
important internal threat intelligence

254
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,200
source um the the organizations that in

255
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,120
the past have uh dared to leave uh

256
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,200
an rdp service uh exposed on the

257
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,040
internet for example they have surely

258
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
encountered incidents around this and

259
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
they have drawn uh lessons learned from

260
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
this they have learned they have drawn

261
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
conclusions from this and uh they have

262
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
found indicators of compromise they have

263
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,480
found ttps during those incidents but

264
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,760
even more

265
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,600
important in terms of internal threat

266
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,959
intelligence is

267
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,959
in my opinion what mssps are

268
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,399
experiencing

269
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
when they're doing security monitoring

270
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,480
digital forensics incident response and

271
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
threat hunting for the many different

272
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,920
customers that they have so they have a

273
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,839
broader view they see much more uh uh

274
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,160
threat intelligence uh in the form of

275
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,399
etps and iocs than your typical

276
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,399
organization would do

277
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,680
so

278
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,760
let's first very quickly summarize what

279
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,240
the mitra attack framework is

280
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
it started out as a threat intelligence

281
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,160
framework to track advanced persistent

282
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
threats apts

283
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,240
and uh it has become much more in the

284
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
meantime but that was the original setup

285
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,519
and um they refer to apts which are the

286
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,519
threat actors and that materialize all

287
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,720
of these threats that we're talking

288
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,600
about they refer to them as groups so

289
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,200
apts in mitra are called groups

290
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,920
the phases of the attack kill chain like

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
the lockheed martin cyberkill chain and

292
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
the faces that exist in this skill chain

293
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,040
they are referred to as tactics in mitra

294
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
and they are slightly reworked of course

295
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,720
they're not the exact same so these

296
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
tactics are uh they start with

297
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,399
reconnaissance and resource development

298
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
they go into initial access uh execution

299
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
persistence etc

300
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,399
and then inside each of these tactics uh

301
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,200
very specific techniques are uh

302
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
described that uh

303
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,079
that are

304
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,320
uh conducted by these

305
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,640
actors by these groups

306
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
in each of the tactics in each of the

307
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
phases now two years ago mitra has

308
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
changed his approach these techniques

309
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,800
have been sometimes uh when the

310
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,720
techniques were very granular they have

311
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,079
been grouped they have been called sub

312
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,399
techniques and grouped into a broader

313
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,760
technique and sometimes when the

314
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,120
technique was a bit too broad they've

315
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
broken it down into several sub

316
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
techniques

317
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,800
then there are there's the procedures

318
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
procedures are very precise description

319
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,040
of how a specific group executes one of

320
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,279
these techniques or uh sub techniques so

321
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,360
how a trap actor

322
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
goes about doing it just like our

323
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,120
procedures in day-to-day work there are

324
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,959
very precise descriptions of how

325
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,720
something is executed

326
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
so for example rather than saying

327
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
this is domain account this is discovery

328
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,320
of domain accounts what which would be

329
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
the technique the procedure describes

330
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,200
says this actor for example wizard

331
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,480
spider

332
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,519
executes this technique by uh running a

333
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,320
tool called bloodhound or running a tool

334
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
called adfind and that brings us to the

335
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,320
last uh

336
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,240
type of record that exists in the mitral

337
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
tech framework which is software

338
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
that software can be

339
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,000
a legitimate software like what i just

340
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,399
mentioned a defined is just an ad

341
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,880
querying tool that is

342
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,760
sorry to interrupt just a second you're

343
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,040
breaking up just a little bit uh in

344
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,760
terms of internet connection i mean uh

345
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,800
so

346
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,399
yeah maybe

347
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,480
hopefully things were stabilized sorry

348
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
to break your flow

349
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,800
no no problem can you hear me

350
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,000
well again now yes you're fine now but i

351
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,440
find that if you try to like slow down

352
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,519
the pace just a little bit that might

353
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,480
give it a chance to catch up i know i

354
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,959
i'm a big talker as well

355
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,600
no problem no problem i'll try to

356
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,040
to

357
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,200
to decrease the pace of it

358
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
all right um

359
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,000
so

360
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,720
uh i i'll repeat the last part so the

361
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,160
the third type of software that could be

362
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,920
that

363
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,200
that exists is malware for example um

364
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600
could be droppers and loader or actual

365
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,160
uh malwares that are being deployed by

366
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,040
these groups uh there were examples like

367
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,839
bazaar load or trig bot or rio or county

368
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,519
that we will address further along in

369
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,240
the presentation

370
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,199
so

371
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,320
this is

372
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,959
the visual representation that

373
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
mitra attack has

374
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,000
has chosen they chose to

375
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,320
visualize these all of these techniques

376
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,160
into matrixes

377
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
there are several of them

378
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
there's also an industrial control

379
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,079
system one there is one for mobile

380
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,480
systems there is one for cloud but this

381
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,880
is the one for enterprises and it's the

382
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,120
the most used one it's the one that

383
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,920
um that is the broadest it's more

384
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,279
representative for uh for organizations

385
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,560
so as you can see

386
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,959
each of these columns represent a tactic

387
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,440
or a phase if you like

388
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,120
from reconnaissance over resource

389
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
development

390
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,160
up until the very last phases like

391
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,399
command and control exfiltration and

392
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,600
impact

393
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
and inside each of these tactics each of

394
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
these phases you see the techniques and

395
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,560
the ones that have a little uh a little

396
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,440
uh dark gray marker at the end are

397
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,839
actually techniques

398
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,320
that if you would uh expand them they

399
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,800
would show um the sub techniques that

400
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,199
are represented there and the little uh

401
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
number behind the the technique name

402
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,519
between brackets is the the amount of

403
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,920
sub techniques that are uh that exist

404
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,320
under each of these techniques i

405
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,000
couldn't expand them here i had to

406
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,279
collapse it because if you expand the

407
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,040
sub techniques it comes so large that

408
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,120
it's not usable for a first slideshow

409
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,279
so

410
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,560
all of this

411
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,480
how could we go about and doing it

412
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,839
because it's um

413
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,440
it's very interesting this might attack

414
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,519
framework but i think that the best way

415
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
to to explain how you can use this for

416
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,600
drug modeling is by using an example

417
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,760
um i'm a big fan of mr robot but i

418
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,480
really find that uh we use the evil corp

419
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,680
uh

420
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,639
way too often for uh for uh as an

421
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,839
example in presentations as a as a

422
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,480
company so i came up with another one

423
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
that i called nice corpse

424
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
and i tried to describe a bit of the

425
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
company profile here uh just to give an

426
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
example so let's say that nice corp is a

427
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,040
fintech company so uh usually fintech

428
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
companies are i.t companies that are

429
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,279
providing it-based services

430
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,279
for or

431
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,759
with the financial industry

432
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,480
this company is located and active in

433
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
the united states of america

434
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,160
they work closely together with

435
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,959
government open banking apis

436
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,199
so they they calls

437
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,920
to apis that are exposed by the banks

438
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,610
for example to get

439
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,959
[Music]

440
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,480
account history

441
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,880
or account

442
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,440
balance or transaction history from from

443
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,160
a

444
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,399
bank account of a quick recap of the

445
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
last things that i was saying so nice

446
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,079
corp is working together closely with

447
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,160
governments in terms of e-identification

448
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,000
of their customers

449
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,160
they're leveraging open banking apis so

450
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,480
uh doing calls to the apis that banks

451
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,639
expose in the in

452
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,440
the

453
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,000
spirit of the open banking initiative

454
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,920
nice corp has also recently been hit by

455
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,720
county ransomware like so many companies

456
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,959
in different industries and different uh

457
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,040
geographical locations

458
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,279
and a partner company of them has been

459
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,959
hit by rio grande somewhere and now

460
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,639
obviously as you can imagine their

461
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
management is very worried about the

462
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,040
future um

463
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
about future attacks and their cyber

464
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,280
insurance company is uh very worried

465
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,319
about ransomware specifically so uh they

466
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,480
want to increase their

467
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,839
their resilience and their detection

468
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,879
rate against these attacks

469
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,319
so

470
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,240
okay now my slideshow doesn't all right

471
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,959
so

472
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,079
um

473
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,840
how can you practically go about using

474
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,480
that microattack framework now to

475
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
identify the techniques in that nice uh

476
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,160
enterprise matrix that are relevant to

477
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,080
the to the company that you are making

478
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,919
the threat profile for

479
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,480
first of all and i found that this was

480
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,880
it was easiest to take all of the group

481
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,559
information the entire table with

482
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,080
information on groups

483
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,720
actors from mitra and copying it into um

484
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
an excel file

485
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,080
and then looking at the profile of the

486
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,400
company for which we are we are

487
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,840
identifying all the threats and

488
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,120
techniques

489
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,919
and

490
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,640
start marking in green all of the

491
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,679
relevant uh aspects that you can find in

492
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
the descriptions of these strap vectors

493
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,240
so you can start looking at

494
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,880
for example whether threat actors are

495
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
targeting the technology industry

496
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
are targeting the banking industry are

497
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,080
targeting governments uh so in terms of

498
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,440
the the

499
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
industries that they are targeting you

500
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,039
can also have a look at

501
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,039
the the countries the geographical

502
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,640
locations that they are targeting for

503
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,679
example

504
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,720
here i made some uh in green i marked in

505
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
some of the

506
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,320
threat actors nato member countries

507
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,799
north america united states of america

508
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,799
all of these references

509
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,960
at the very bottom wizard spider was

510
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
included because

511
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,280
it's

512
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,799
an apt that's very well known for

513
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,960
ransomware campaigns

514
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,280
which was also one of the big

515
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,280
the big topics for for uh nice corp and

516
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,799
um then i found that if you end up with

517
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,799
too many uh groups in in the in the list

518
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,280
an interesting way is to go back to see

519
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
the ones that you have made green

520
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
markings in and look at things that are

521
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,799
potentially um indicators of the of

522
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,640
those groups better being excluded from

523
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,720
the trap profile like for example you

524
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,679
can see

525
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
blind eagle uh on the fourth uh on the

526
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
fourth row um it does target government

527
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,080
institutions but mainly colombian

528
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,679
government institutions so for a

529
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,080
organization that is located and active

530
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,600
in the united states of america it might

531
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,640
just be

532
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,080
less relevant that's a bit of a

533
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,520
balancing exercise that the threat

534
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,360
intelligence analyst

535
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,199
needs to needs to take into account

536
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,640
from those

537
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,320
jet actors from all those groups that

538
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,799
you've identified you can zoom in on

539
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,360
them a bit more so

540
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,880
go a bit further than the general

541
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
description look at the software that

542
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,760
they are using and you will see that

543
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
there will already be some matches for

544
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
example if you look at wizard spider

545
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,760
year i took a very small screenshot of

546
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,720
four of the many software references

547
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
that are linked to wizard spyder so you

548
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,400
can see that they are leveraging global

549
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,960
strike a very very popular pen testing

550
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440
framework

551
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,080
uh ransomware dire ransomware and emoted

552
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,039
you can see that these software

553
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,679
items also

554
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,600
have a table where they are referencing

555
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,720
all the different techniques that they

556
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,000
are using so these techniques are

557
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
potentially interesting to uh to add to

558
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,360
the profile as well and from these

559
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,799
different uh

560
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,880
pieces of software you can often see

561
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,960
that they will link back to other

562
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
malware or other software and sometimes

563
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,280
the malware that is used to deliver this

564
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,320
malware

565
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,720
um for example you can see here uh with

566
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,039
quantity uh that it's being distributed

567
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,159
via trigbot so on the on below uh in the

568
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,559
list you can add trigbot and then go

569
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,799
look a bit deeper into what trigbot is

570
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,039
all about there you can see that trigbot

571
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,520
is possibly a successor of dire

572
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,840
so dire can be included you can see also

573
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
that it makes reference to groups we'll

574
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
come back to that in the

575
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
in the next slide and in the second row

576
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,159
you see that for for uh ryuk for example

577
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,919
there's an indication that there are

578
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,640
good similarities with hermes ransomware

579
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,320
so you can expect the techniques will

580
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,280
overlap there as well

581
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
and then the last i zoomed in a bit on

582
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,640
the last example where with trigbot

583
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,320
um you you would find uh the reference

584
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
to wizard spiders say that you wouldn't

585
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,400
have had wizard spider on your radar as

586
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,880
a threat uh as a relevant threat actor

587
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,360
you would uh eventually

588
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,440
run into it through

589
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
the the chain

590
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,559
going through conti

591
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,559
which is being distributed by trigbot

592
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,320
and then trigbot which is being left

593
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,559
bridged by wizard spider another

594
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,600
approach that you can use as well is uh

595
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,080
then just zoom in again on that uh draft

596
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,799
actor and see which software they use uh

597
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,320
sorry which group that uses this

598
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,840
software so in the case of trade bot you

599
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,679
will see that not only wizard spider but

600
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,559
also also ta505

601
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,159
is a draft actor that leverages this

602
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,480
software and you could therefore include

603
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,280
uh ta-505 as well depending whether you

604
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,919
see a lot of overlaps with the profile

605
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,919
of your of the company for which you are

606
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,200
making the profile

607
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,679
then you can uh next to the mitra attack

608
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,600
framework also consult other cut

609
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
intelligence sources

610
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
external threat intelligence sources

611
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,280
that is i just

612
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,720
put a couple of

613
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,960
screenshots here to to give you an idea

614
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,120
of how easy it is to find the

615
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,640
information on the internet on the

616
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,320
public internet for this

617
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,480
i just used gunty as a as a

618
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,919
an example

619
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,080
at the upper left corner you see a

620
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,400
report from caesar

621
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,919
where they are

622
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,760
enumerating all of the mitra attack

623
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,000
techniques with their t number with

624
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,559
their t reference uh and uh and

625
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
explaining how conti is

626
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,799
is conducting those

627
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,120
uh the bottom left you can see a sofo

628
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,480
slab uh report extract where they

629
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
per per tactic they have listed all of

630
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
the products all of the software that is

631
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
being used by the county ransomware

632
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,480
operators

633
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,159
on the top right is a alien alien vault

634
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,480
where you can see uh if you're if you

635
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
look for county you can see that they

636
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
have

637
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
about a thousand pulses which are

638
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,120
basically like threatened health feeds

639
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,440
they have 13 000 indicators of

640
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
compromise

641
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,360
they link county to 12 malware families

642
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,120
etc so there you can zoom in you can

643
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,960
find iocs you can again find other ttps

644
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,360
in the middle uh the the blue uh

645
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,279
screenshot is from any run it's an

646
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,159
online sandbox um where you can also

647
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,600
look through the public submissions so

648
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,799
everyone who has

649
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,279
submitted a sample there to to run in

650
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,600
the in this online sandbox and that has

651
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,320
set it to public you can find them back

652
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,240
and you can find the results and you

653
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,840
will see that if you open the report of

654
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,200
each of these

655
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,880
these sandbox runs

656
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
the report even contains also references

657
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,000
to all of the techniques of the mitra

658
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,840
attack

659
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,200
framework and then lastly on the bottom

660
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,080
right

661
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,960
uh i looked up gaunty and virustotal

662
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,159
and there

663
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,159
generally there are some indicators like

664
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,320
the hashes and and the verdict of

665
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,480
virustotal which is already

666
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
interesting but in the comments in the

667
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,880
community section you will see a lot of

668
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,080
references by uh security researchers

669
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,679
and analysts that on a daily basis are

670
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,520
working with this and this screenshot

671
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,799
was made a couple of days ago and you

672
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,880
see that just an hour before i made the

673
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,440
screenshot uh there was there were still

674
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,880
compti uh

675
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,600
samples being being tested and reports

676
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,679
and findings on them being posted it

677
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,840
will also often include references to

678
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,799
other sandboxes like joe's sandbox etc

679
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,880
it's also very interesting to to look at

680
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
these uh external threat intelligence

681
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,200
sources to dig deeper into the the

682
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
software or the threat actors or the

683
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,760
ttps that you are investigating for the

684
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,000
trend profile

685
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,279
okay

686
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,120
then last but not least after all of

687
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,279
this external intelligence there's also

688
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,400
the internal

689
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,679
intelligence

690
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,480
i have to say that i found and this is

691
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,640
completely normal that non-mssp

692
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,279
organizations will have a

693
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,640
less a

694
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,559
less amount of threat intelligence

695
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,640
coming from their internal practices

696
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
it's normal because

697
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,440
hopefully uh organizations that are not

698
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
mssps just like the bank that i that i

699
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,640
worked for uh during uh several years

700
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,960
hopefully they don't uh have too many

701
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,559
incidents they don't have too many

702
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,000
detections that they can draw threat

703
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,679
intelligence from from security

704
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,960
monitoring it could be hopefully

705
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
everything has been prevented and it's

706
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
just from your security monitoring but

707
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,799
they don't uh typically do a lot of

708
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,039
incident response or digital forensics

709
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,200
uh at least not in depth

710
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
and also less threat hunting or less

711
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,840
variations in drought hunting than a

712
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,880
typical ms mssp would be conducting

713
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
whereas an mssp

714
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,960
is servicing many different

715
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,679
customers and they do

716
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,240
they have more like are

717
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,039
in better place to identify new ttps

718
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,559
uh or a new modus operandi or transits

719
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,200
that they are uh that are

720
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
in being observed in the wild so for

721
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,400
example uh with new ttps

722
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,919
just a couple of months ago i think

723
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,360
about five or six months ago somewhere

724
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,799
in summer

725
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,600
the process uh ghost thing has been

726
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,760
identified as a new uh as a new

727
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,960
technique

728
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,120
uh which is not yet included in the

729
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,039
mitral attack framework as a specific

730
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,400
sub technique of the process injection

731
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,559
technique which i expected it will be

732
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,320
become part of in the future is actually

733
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,600
an an evolution of process double

734
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,679
ganging so that's a new gtp that's

735
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,279
already being detected in the wild but

736
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,440
that's not not yet in the uh in the

737
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,120
mitral attack framework

738
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,279
new motors operandi uh for example

739
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,679
lately we've encountered a lot of um

740
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,200
county ransomware operators um that are

741
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,480
um

742
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
when when they fail to

743
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,159
deploy the ransomware successfully or

744
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,799
encrypt a significant part of the data

745
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,559
in the customer's network

746
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,000
um they they fall back to a sort of uh

747
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,480
bluff poker game where they

748
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,679
um create fake evidence of data being

749
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,080
exfiltrated and then they try this way

750
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,200
to send it to to management or to uh to

751
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,799
representatives or stakeholders of the

752
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,279
company to try to force them into paying

753
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,960
a ransom while they actually don't even

754
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,399
have

755
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,159
this

756
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,399
well they don't even have uh exfiltrate

757
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,399
the data from the company

758
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,799
and then another trend uh that we for

759
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,880
example see is that

760
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,410
the ransomware operators are

761
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,720
[Music]

762
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,520
more are the skill set that they are

763
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,640
using is decreasing um a couple of

764
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
months ago this was also confirmed by a

765
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,399
document that leaked

766
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,320
on the internet it was a disgruntled

767
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,480
affiliate of a county ransomware gang

768
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,720
who posted the manuals uh the

769
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,480
instructions that are created for the

770
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,840
ransomware operators the county

771
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,760
ransomware operators and you can see

772
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,520
from these instructions that they are

773
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,279
very uh

774
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,600
uh very much uh oriented at

775
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,480
non-specialists so it's very clear that

776
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,120
a subset of very advanced um

777
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
attackers are

778
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,640
generating or or

779
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,159
acquiring the access to different

780
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,520
companies and they are creating these

781
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,279
manuals but they are selling the

782
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,880
accesses or they are

783
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
monetizing through a sort of pyramid

784
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,600
scheme uh these accesses by letting less

785
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,039
advanced uh operators execute a

786
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,880
checklist of

787
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
instructions that they have prepared

788
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,679
another thing another interesting part

789
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,919
of internal threat intelligence is that

790
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,720
you can include ttps that are popular

791
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,240
with these less advanced more

792
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
opportunistic attackers but are no

793
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,720
longer tracked in mitra because apds are

794
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,559
no longer or never actually use them

795
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,240
a good example of this is for example

796
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,760
network service scanning when you're

797
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,720
creating a threat profile based on apts

798
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,200
on modern apt so apds that have been

799
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,279
active in the last few years you will

800
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,399
see

801
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,799
that network service scanning will often

802
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,919
not appear in the techniques that

803
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,039
that are tagged when you select these uh

804
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,279
these strat actors while it's actually a

805
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,200
technique that for opportunistic

806
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,360
attackers less advanced attackers very

807
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,440
often is used and that's something that

808
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,039
uh mssp's generally this this um this

809
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,399
feeling with uh with with uh the

810
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,480
attacks that occur on a daily basis

811
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,039
this lives with mssps they they just

812
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,440
discover this type of

813
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,760
of trend uh through their security

814
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
practices

815
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,240
so

816
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,399
micro created the navigator

817
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,320
uh on the github page you can see the

818
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,799
navigator for the micro attack

819
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,960
matrix this is a very interesting tool

820
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,320
because now that you have selected all

821
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,399
of these techniques uh that are used by

822
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,760
all these strap actors that you want to

823
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,919
include in your thread model you can map

824
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,159
them you can as you can see here i did

825
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,399
it with a coloring scheme so this is the

826
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,240
result of five thread actors being

827
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,600
selected and

828
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
and some techniques being added that

829
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,840
don't even belong to the strip actors uh

830
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,919
the the less advanced one we added them

831
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,600
manually

832
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,679
and here out of the color grading is not

833
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,159
very important because i i never used

834
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,679
scoring of those techniques but you

835
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,480
could for example

836
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,039
use different scoring and different

837
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,200
coloring uh based on how often these

838
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,799
techniques occur so for example if one

839
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,480
of your trad actors that's the way that

840
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,159
is presented here if one of the actors

841
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,840
was using that technique is presented in

842
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,240
green if two are using it it's yellow

843
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
tree is orange four is red and the fuxia

844
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,440
color is the one technique that was used

845
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,760
by all five of the trap actors that were

846
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,279
taken into account

847
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,480
you could

848
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,279
use this to prioritize uh even the

849
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,440
techniques that that are used by more

850
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,120
detectors but we didn't go about it in

851
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,440
this exercise because it was uh because

852
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,679
we found that the amount of techniques

853
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,880
was still

854
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,000
still

855
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,640
very usable

856
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,919
for all of these uh techniques you can

857
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,279
as you can see here for example under

858
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,200
the technique os credential dumping

859
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,440
there is a sub technique uh elsa's

860
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,399
memory credential dumping you can go and

861
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,640
zoom in in the micro attack framework

862
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,519
and look at how to detect these

863
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,320
techniques what are the the data sources

864
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,480
that you need to detect uh this

865
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
technique being executed you will see

866
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,279
that for uh for elsa's memory uh

867
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,720
credential dumping

868
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,679
you would require command execution uh

869
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,159
operating system api execution process

870
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,519
access process creation etc

871
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,919
so this is a very important uh

872
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,480
part of the exercise because uh you need

873
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,240
to identify for all the techniques that

874
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,519
you have

875
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,200
added to the thread profile you need to

876
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,919
identify what detection sources you need

877
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,200
exactly to be able to uh to detect them

878
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,640
adequately

879
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,880
there is a nice little tool that exists

880
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,039
to do this if if this wouldn't exist you

881
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,320
would have to

882
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,679
go and look in each one of the

883
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,360
techniques that you have now tagged

884
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,480
nicely in your uh in your in your mitral

885
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
attack navigator you would have to go

886
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,559
and zoom in on each one and list all of

887
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,200
the uh data sources that you can use to

888
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,840
detect them

889
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,519
luckily two very nice guys that work at

890
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,080
the harbour bank cyber defense center

891
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,320
they've created a cool a tool that's

892
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,480
called detect um

893
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,320
and it's actually a

894
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,640
set of python scripts they do

895
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,519
more more than only this but the part of

896
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,039
it that i want to talk about today is um

897
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,000
the script that they can be used um to

898
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,240
translate this json layer that you see

899
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,640
on the left so the the

900
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,360
mitra attack navigator uh matrix that

901
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,760
has been covered you can save this this

902
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,559
uh

903
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,720
this layer in a json file and that json

904
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,399
file you can translate through that

905
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,960
python script into a list that does a

906
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,200
count of all the data sources

907
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,279
that can be used to detect all of these

908
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,039
techniques so you can see here this is

909
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,279
an example this is not uh related to the

910
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,960
nice scoreboard to an exercise we did i

911
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,880
took these screenshots from their github

912
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,840
page but so on the left you see

913
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,519
microattack navigator that's filled in

914
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,679
the json layer has been exported and

915
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,840
then through this detect

916
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,240
python script has been translated into a

917
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,399
list of that counts how many times

918
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,799
command execution appears as a data

919
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,000
source in all of these techniques

920
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,519
that you see on the left so command

921
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,200
execution could be used to detect 243 of

922
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
the techniques on that are colored on

923
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
the left

924
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,519
process creation as a data source can be

925
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,000
used for 197 etc

926
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,440
now

927
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,119
these data sources

928
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,719
are um

929
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,040
rather uh they are very they're very

930
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,359
granular but they they are not

931
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,480
translated directly to some log doesn't

932
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,760
say for example

933
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,399
it says process creation but what this

934
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,719
framework does not do for you is for

935
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,239
example telling you that process

936
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,719
creation is something that you could

937
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,399
detect with a detection source like

938
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,639
sysmont so the data source process

939
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,719
creation is part of the detection source

940
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,560
sysmon for example

941
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
it's very important that in an exercise

942
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,480
where you want to decide on these

943
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,239
detection sources

944
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,639
you also list uh all the detection

945
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,480
sources for this data that are already

946
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,159
present in your organization and like i

947
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:52,960
said at the beginning of the

948
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,480
presentation you might already have

949
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,119
windows event logs you might have sysmon

950
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,240
uh you might want uh i want to uh look

951
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,480
at your firewall logs etc

952
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,359
um but on top of that you also need to

953
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,800
take into account and again that's the

954
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,079
job of the treadmill intelligence

955
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,720
analyst you need to take into account

956
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,480
also the detection sources that are

957
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
offered and preferably mastered by your

958
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,640
msp or mssp or

959
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,119
several of your mssps

960
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,880
and even thirdly look at the ones that

961
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,960
are available on the market because it's

962
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,480
not because you don't have it present in

963
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,599
the organization or because your mssp

964
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,320
is not offering it that maybe another

965
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,760
vendor in the market is not offering

966
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,280
something very interesting that you

967
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,599
would uh like to that you would like to

968
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,760
include or deploy as a new detection

969
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,839
server so that all of that is part of

970
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,000
the threat intelligence analyst's job

971
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,839
now it's not important to have this

972
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,520
described on the same level this can be

973
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,000
log types this can be product types

974
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,920
right you can you can say product type

975
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
is edr but you can also talk about a

976
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,079
very specific product you can talk about

977
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,640
microsoft defender for identifier

978
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,560
endpoint or a crowdstrike falcon as an

979
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,280
edr but you can also reference specific

980
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
security solutions like an

981
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,280
anti-ransomware solution or something

982
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,599
from the microsoft cloud stack like

983
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,760
defender for identity you can just

984
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,000
describe them at any level that is fit

985
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,160
for your organization and then list them

986
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,520
this is an example of uh of a list that

987
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,440
you could that you could create a list

988
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,680
of potential detection sources here we

989
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,599
kept it a bit generic and for example

990
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,680
you see the two ones for uh that are

991
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,599
attacked with availability on the mssp

992
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,599
side defender for identity is a very

993
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,800
specific active directory uh on-prem

994
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,599
active directory uh detection source but

995
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,680
edr solution your mss e might for

996
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,920
example offer two different epr products

997
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,680
you can describe it as a product type

998
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,599
and then later on choose what it is that

999
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,760
you want to uh that you want to pursue

1000
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,720
from your

1001
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,119
from your uh mssp

1002
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,359
uh so just another couple of examples

1003
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,520
here listed but this is the format in

1004
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,200
which we've uh we've

1005
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,680
listed or enumerated these detection

1006
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,720
sources so far

1007
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,119
now is the point where these

1008
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,200
uh the data sources that we have

1009
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,359
enumerated using the

1010
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,280
detect python script

1011
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,560
and the ones that we need to uh

1012
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,079
to detect all of the techniques that

1013
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,839
we've added to the threat profile need

1014
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,680
to be linked to the products that we

1015
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,119
have on our radar that we have

1016
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,040
internally that our mssps are offering

1017
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,800
or that we are thinking about buying in

1018
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,040
the market generally

1019
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,920
this

1020
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,040
is an exercise that i'd say is half half

1021
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,079
of this is experience and knowledge of

1022
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,280
the analyst but of course there is a

1023
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,839
documented basis for this as well all of

1024
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,680
these logs all of these products have

1025
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,920
their documentation like sysmon you

1026
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,599
there's endless documentation and

1027
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,440
tutorials on sysmon that describes all

1028
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,920
of the different events event ids that

1029
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,760
describes all of the different uh data

1030
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,240
sources that you could find in there

1031
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,960
and and so that's very useful

1032
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,280
it becomes a bit different in it with

1033
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,359
products because what we're noticing is

1034
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,599
that some of those products are

1035
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,560
becoming more more of black boxes where

1036
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
what what they are detecting is not

1037
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,640
exhaustively enumerated by the vendor

1038
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,320
because it is the

1039
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,800
internal um

1040
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,359
recipe of the of the vendor for example

1041
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,839
with edr solutions this is the case

1042
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,960
uh edr solutions well the edr vendor

1043
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,480
will not give you a list and say here

1044
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,880
are the 500 techniques or the 500

1045
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
signatures or the 500 rules that we have

1046
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,119
to trigger on it's also not that simple

1047
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,359
because er solutions typically take into

1048
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,599
account machine learning etc so it's not

1049
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,440
that simple for an organization to

1050
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,119
present you with an exhausted list of

1051
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,560
everything that will be detected by

1052
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
their edr solution

1053
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,200
there's another option for these

1054
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,920
and that's to actually go about testing

1055
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,359
um these these solutions against several

1056
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,480
techniques

1057
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,320
uh now this testing can be done through

1058
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,400
red or purple teaming but there's also a

1059
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,920
lot of initiatives that you can find on

1060
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,680
the internet mitral evaluations for

1061
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,560
example

1062
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,520
is one

1063
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,599
um and we'll come back to that in in one

1064
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,800
of the next slide but my free

1065
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,240
evaluations um uses a set of select the

1066
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,599
technical threat profile that they

1067
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,599
create every year based on a specific

1068
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,839
trend actor and then they test all of

1069
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,440
the uh the popular security tools

1070
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,160
against those uh the techniques that are

1071
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,440
employed by these by easter actors

1072
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,240
so that's also a good way to to cover

1073
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,520
the tools for which you don't have an

1074
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,920
exhaustive list or very detailed

1075
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,240
documentation

1076
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,200
so

1077
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,440
as an example exercise to show you what

1078
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,040
this looks like what what could be the

1079
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
outcome of such and such

1080
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,359
such an exercise

1081
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,440
we actually took and this is an exercise

1082
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,760
that we did for customers of ours

1083
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,720
um

1084
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,040
we we took the six apt groups that the

1085
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,119
mitra attack evaluations have used in

1086
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,599
the last four years so you see in 2018

1087
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,680
and 2019 you will no longer find them on

1088
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,040
the mitra

1089
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,520
attack evaluations uh

1090
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,520
webpage they they have been classified

1091
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,880
now but in 2018 they used apt-tree as

1092
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,560
the representative

1093
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,319
actor 2019 they used apt-29 in 2020 they

1094
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,480
used carbon neck and fin 7 which is

1095
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,800
basically considered as one big trap

1096
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,119
actor there are separate separate actors

1097
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,319
in the micro attack framework but

1098
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,400
they're so closely linked that they were

1099
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,359
used

1100
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,359
together in 2020

1101
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,720
very representative for uh for uh the

1102
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,119
banking uh threat profile

1103
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,040
and then this year is still ongoing they

1104
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,280
used wizard spider very representative

1105
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,680
for the ongoing ransomware

1106
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,079
attacks in the last few years and uh

1107
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,200
sand worm

1108
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,680
also somewhere referenced as sandwich

1109
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,599
team very often

1110
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,920
on top of that we added some techniques

1111
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,079
that we observed that were used by less

1112
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,160
advanced but but uh

1113
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,079
and more opportunistic attackers are but

1114
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,440
then they're very popular with these

1115
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,200
attackers like for example network

1116
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,119
service scanning we didn't include it in

1117
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,560
the exercise while it was not part of

1118
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,160
any of these

1119
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,760
techniques

1120
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
and then we went and excluded some

1121
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,280
techniques from the

1122
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,040
well all of the techniques from the

1123
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,720
reconnaissance and resource development

1124
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,480
tactics they're the two chronologically

1125
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,400
they are the two first tactics

1126
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,920
um and they are the ones that are

1127
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,040
typically conducted outside of the

1128
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,599
visibility scope of the organization

1129
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,640
whenever someone is setting up um

1130
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,119
phishing websites setting up servers

1131
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,200
developing malware that's done in a way

1132
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,119
that is not detectable from inside your

1133
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,200
organization it's not in the network we

1134
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,839
have other solutions for that which we

1135
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,839
call brand intelligence monitoring where

1136
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,079
we're going to monitor

1137
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,359
ssl certificate registrations and

1138
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,079
dns registrations that are using

1139
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,240
variants of the brand names of our

1140
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,319
customers etc but we didn't include them

1141
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,920
here because this was an exercise very

1142
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,839
specifically oriented that what we could

1143
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,079
detect inside an organization with seam

1144
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,240
solutions and other security solutions

1145
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,160
inside the network

1146
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,319
now this resulted in a threat profile of

1147
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,720
a total of 163

1148
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,040
techniques being selected

1149
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,599
um you can see this was actually the one

1150
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,359
that uh that i used a bit earlier as

1151
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,800
well that's what this um this navigator

1152
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,280
visualization came from now it doesn't

1153
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,400
look like

1154
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,720
that many techniques in this

1155
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,599
in this view but remember that this is

1156
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,480
the collapsed view so if i expand all of

1157
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,880
the techniques all of the

1158
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,400
techniques would become visible with

1159
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,520
their with their coloring scheme

1160
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,920
so this uh

1161
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,720
this

1162
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,920
navigator visualization was saved into a

1163
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,839
json layer

1164
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:46,000
transformed with the detect.pi

1165
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,359
script into

1166
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,480
the

1167
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,079
list of data sources and the data

1168
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,280
sources were translated into a list of

1169
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,400
logs and products that

1170
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,920
and i took an example of one of the

1171
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,079
customers for who we did this exercise

1172
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,880
into this list of detection sources

1173
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,440
and what we actually did was we ranked i

1174
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,960
forgot to mention that in the previous

1175
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,079
slide we ranked all of these

1176
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,040
these tools as the first best second

1177
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,839
best third best for best etc

1178
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,960
solution to detect those techniques

1179
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,000
and

1180
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
what you can see here in this

1181
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,599
in this matrix

1182
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,800
is uh

1183
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,480
very quickly and i marked it in red

1184
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,359
and it gradually goes down to green uh

1185
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,760
when the number is decreasing but the

1186
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,599
edr solution and in this specific

1187
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,200
customer's case the edr solution that

1188
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,880
was on the radar was microsoft defender

1189
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,480
for endpoint was discovering um

1190
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,240
56

1191
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,400
of all the techniques in the threat

1192
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,839
profile as one of the uh

1193
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,280
no sorry as the best solution so mde was

1194
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,240
the best solution to detect 56

1195
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,680
of all of the techniques that were in

1196
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
the threat profile now if we looked at

1197
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,680
it a bit further

1198
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,839
we looked at all of the options where

1199
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,680
mde could be

1200
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,800
that could be a detection uh source for

1201
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,920
the technique it even extends to 82

1202
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,319
of all the techniques that we

1203
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,640
that we had added to the threat profile

1204
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,319
so the conclusion for for the customer

1205
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:25,359
was

1206
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,599
82 of those selected techniques could in

1207
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,079
some way be detected by an edr solution

1208
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,400
but for 56 of them edr is even the best

1209
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,560
detection source

1210
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,960
uh defender for identity was another

1211
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,640
product that was on their radar and that

1212
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,240
could cover up to 12 percent of the

1213
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,079
selected techniques in the threat

1214
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,839
profile

1215
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,040
firewall logs can cover up to 22 of the

1216
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,040
techniques ids idp could could uh detect

1217
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
up to 21

1218
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,359
and dns monitoring could cover up to

1219
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,880
seven percent

1220
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
so

1221
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,680
what

1222
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,160
you you can imagine what the consequence

1223
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,800
on the customer side was

1224
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,680
a new project was started and an edr

1225
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
solution was deployed so so we actually

1226
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,240
deployed an edr solution to replace

1227
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,319
their uh their their

1228
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,040
what previously was done based on on

1229
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,520
sysmon and in-house detected

1230
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,440
detection in-house developed detection

1231
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,040
logic

1232
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,359
a project is being started to deploy a

1233
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,440
defender for identity

1234
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,880
on the firewall logs we've zoomed in and

1235
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,720
discovered that we were only

1236
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,880
ingesting in the seam the internal

1237
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,960
firewall log so the external firewall

1238
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,119
logs have been added there as well it's

1239
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,760
very important to leverage another part

1240
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
of threat intelligence which are iocs

1241
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,920
known malicious ips non-malicious domain

1242
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,359
names etc

1243
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,000
these are typically uh better detected

1244
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,160
on your external so your your internet

1245
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,440
facing your

1246
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,000
your border firewalls

1247
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,440
and then ids and dns monitoring are

1248
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,200
being looked into at the moment to see

1249
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,480
how they can be uh included in the in

1250
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,640
the setup in the stack of this uh of

1251
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,480
this customer

1252
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,680
so just to

1253
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,200
to show how this exercise actually ended

1254
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,480
up in

1255
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,720
driving the initiatives driving the new

1256
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,119
projects that have been initiated on the

1257
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,000
customer side

1258
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,760
now

1259
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,680
last slide a couple of remarks that i

1260
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,520
want to make

1261
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,680
trap modeling can be used for other

1262
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,160
purposes as well uh it can be used to

1263
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,319
drive your threat hunting and red purple

1264
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,319
theming obviously if you have created a

1265
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,160
threat profile of your or threat model

1266
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,040
of your organization you can

1267
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,000
identify the techniques that are not

1268
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,480
covered by your detection sources and

1269
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,000
therefore perform threat hunting

1270
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,560
specifically uh oriented at detecting

1271
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,200
them you can also do uh red or purple

1272
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,720
theming to uh to to highlight uh gaps in

1273
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,040
the in the or even highlight gaps in the

1274
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,200
detection but also improve the detection

1275
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,520
uh make it more granular uh refine it

1276
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,760
continuously improve it

1277
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,520
you can use it to evaluate security

1278
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,560
products as the mitra uh evaluations

1279
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,160
it's it's not mitral attack but it's

1280
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,480
actually mitra ingenuity uh that is

1281
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,480
working on this they are evaluating

1282
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,079
security products uh by uh trap modeling

1283
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,640
each year based on a chat actor that

1284
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,920
throughout that year their threat

1285
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,720
intelligence actors have

1286
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,559
identified as the most prevalent or the

1287
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,200
most representative threat actor

1288
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,720
and you can also use it to research

1289
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,119
coverage in terms of specific threats

1290
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,359
for example we are now doing a purple

1291
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,000
theming exercise uh where we're setting

1292
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,839
up all of the different edr solutions

1293
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,000
that we have against the threat profile

1294
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,920
that we have created for ransomware

1295
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,400
campaigns of the last few years and

1296
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,359
evaluating those um those different edr

1297
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,680
solutions that we're offering to to see

1298
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,880
which one uh covers um all of the

1299
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,520
different techniques uh that are used by

1300
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,920
ransomware operators best or most

1301
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,520
exhaustively

1302
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,599
now this is not a one-size-fits-all

1303
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,119
solution

1304
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,480
we have a tendency in id and in security

1305
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,200
to

1306
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,440
try to automate as much as possible and

1307
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,599
i'm all for it

1308
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,280
wherever it's possible i try to do it

1309
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,599
this type of work is really

1310
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,680
something that an intelligent human

1311
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,760
being preferably with some experience

1312
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,839
has to conduct so i'm a strong advocate

1313
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,200
of having this type of exercise

1314
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,200
conducted by threat intelligence

1315
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,760
analysts or or soccer c-cert analysts

1316
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,680
that uh or

1317
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,760
soccer cyber security architects people

1318
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,040
that have the the understanding of how

1319
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,640
uh sub works

1320
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,160
and um

1321
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,640
and not to quickly jump to try to

1322
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,960
automate this with tools who will never

1323
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,200
have the same effect so for me the

1324
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
tailoring

1325
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,000
of this approach to match the the goals

1326
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,079
of the exercise a very important aspect

1327
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,000
of doing good trap modeling

1328
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
and the last but not least this

1329
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,920
presentation here has focused very much

1330
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,040
on detection um that's typical for us as

1331
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,480
as uh

1332
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,040
uh professionals we always want to

1333
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,640
detect and respond

1334
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,359
but a very important aspect is also

1335
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,440
in terms of lesson learned to look at

1336
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,280
the mitigation because mitigation can

1337
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,920
sometimes be a better option rather than

1338
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,800
for example detecting and responding to

1339
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,319
the disabling

1340
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,400
of of security tooling the disabling of

1341
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,800
anti-virus at the disabling of edr or

1342
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,160
whatsoever

1343
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,119
um

1344
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,640
it uh can mitigation can sometimes be a

1345
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,079
better or an equally good solution uh

1346
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,920
think about for example not running

1347
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,680
local admin not giving local admin

1348
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,760
permissions to your users this will make

1349
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,000
it much harder for an attacker to

1350
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,280
develop a a malware or or a loader a

1351
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,720
stager that will

1352
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
in the first stages of the attack be

1353
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,800
able to deactivate the security tooling

1354
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,319
that you have in place and then continue

1355
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,400
to the next phase of the the cyber kill

1356
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,079
chain

1357
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,839
so um

1358
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,280
that brings me to the

1359
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,040
end of the

1360
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,520
presentation i hope that was uh clear

1361
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
and of added value to the the people

1362
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,680

1363
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,040
