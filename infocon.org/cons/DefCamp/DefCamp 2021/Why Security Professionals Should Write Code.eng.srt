1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,879
with insights and we are eager for you

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,440
to dive right in

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,839
all right thank you you basically uh did

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,840
my whole talk in one

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,240
sentence thank you

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,839
i'm going to share my slides

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,400
so as alexandra mentioned i'm here today

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,160
to talk to you about why security

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,800
professionals should be writing code

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,519
um so just first who am i a bit of

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,240
background information about me um i was

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,320
in a red team and a blue team so i like

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,079
to call myself purple because that's the

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
marketing term for it um i was working

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,160
at mcafee by before that at kpn igen and

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
fox i t foxite is a dutch security

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,600
company for those who don't know it

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,760
i love doing conferences

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,200
i think my

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,840
first touch with cyber security was at a

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,760
conference so that was really nice when

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,360
i was doing my computer science masters

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
at udelph

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
i'm the organizer of wika which is a uh

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,960
that's the nice logo down there um

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
with the the women in cyber security

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,600
community uh of the netherlands but my

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,680
true passion besides cyber security is

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,119
writing books and playing dungeons and

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,200
dragons because that's uh every

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,720
everything everyone should be doing this

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,479
in their lives playing dnd

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,040
um anyway enough about me uh let's go

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
back to the topic at hand

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,720
why security professionals should be

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,759
writing code um this is

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,360
sorry about this the dog was barking

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,200
so we have everything today we have

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,360
barking dogs we have internet problems

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,200
it's great uh i'll just go into the code

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
and just go back to the slide

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,000
i thought i heard something but okay

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,960
sorry about this um

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,920
all right so to go back we have this

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
pink script

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,119
um that takes the input of a user and

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,360
i'll just show you how to run it and

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,240
actually i have access to the

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,280
uh

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,520
oh i this i see there was no sound but

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,439
it's back now apparently so

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,119
i have access to the chat so if the

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,000
audience wants to contribute to this

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
writing a secure ping

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,560
software

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
then i will

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,440
i can i can read what's in the audience

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,319
chat

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,640
so i'm going to share my code

60
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,840
for the demo

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,599
and just to show you how it runs

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,720
and this

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,959
is spoilers

64
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,400
just ping google

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
that's it but

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,680
as you could see from the spoilers i can

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
easily escape

68
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,200
this uh command because it basically

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,840
just take the user input and runs it uh

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,160
with os.system and for anyone who has

71
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,680
price and knowledge they know that this

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
is this should be like a red flag for oh

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
god this is really not insecure you can

74
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,160
just say okay you can ping this stuff

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,519
and then

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,480
get all the secrets

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,560
so how would you secure this and i would

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,520
like to see some

79
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,480
[Music]

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,239
input from the audience if possible

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,239
otherwise i will just keep on going

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,959
i think this is like delay actually

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,800
right in the

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
the live stream and

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,040
me

86
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,239
you can keep on going and i can read you

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,799
any replies that come in on the chat

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,400
yeah sounds good

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
um so one way to uh actually secure this

90
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
one

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280
thing you would think for example what

92
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,720
you can see was i

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,239
basically broke

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,439
the initial query by adding a semicolon

95
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,519
and then run another command of my

96
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,280
choice so what i can do

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,840
is maybe i can add an

98
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,519
if statement i'll just go back to the

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,439
slides i can add an if statement that

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,040
says um

101
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,080
if you find the semicolon then just

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
remove it and then execute the command

103
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,238
this is great

104
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,079
um

105
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,279
but

106
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,040
there are other symbols that you can

107
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
actually add

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
that

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,560
um

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,280
will also break the command

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
and that is a pipe symbol so then you

112
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
just say uh

113
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,479
forget the input type it somewhere else

114
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,360
and then

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
um

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,520
execute whatever command comes after

117
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
so what are you going to do are you

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,120
going to for each of the characters that

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
are considered bad are you going to add

120
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
them to your if statement and this is

121
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
something that we actually see a lot in

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,400
um in code that is written which is more

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,040
the blacklisting approach or the

124
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
disallow list approach

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,720
uh where you just keep on adding

126
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
characters to to a list of bad

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
characters

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,880
and

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
and then you process the input but this

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,240
is not actually the right way to do it

131
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
because

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
if there is one entry point hackers will

133
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,759
always find a way to get it

134
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,680
so the i'm just going to tell you

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,759
briefly how to actually do this if you

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,080
would uh if you really insist on having

137
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,160
the os dot system

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,720
python command here uh the way to do

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
this would be with a allow list so or

140
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,919
whitelist approach so you only allow

141
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,400
a regex that matches an ip address in

142
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,160
this case you just want an ip address so

143
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,240
you will you will only allow something

144
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,440
that looks like an ip address and

145
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,880
nothing else that would be the way to do

146
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,600
it

147
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
but for a lot of um developers that

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,280
where you keep on pinging back and forth

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
saying yeah you know you're allowing uh

150
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,360
semi columns or you're allowing this

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
they're not going to think about

152
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
um oh maybe we should just change the

153
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,280
mindset of okay disallow into what do we

154
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,919
actually allow and this some this

155
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,759
conclusion could have been made by just

156
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,520
talking to the security specialist

157
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
immediately and maybe brainstorm about

158
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
the problem a little more and especially

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,880
if they have no idea how the hacker

160
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,240
mindset works

161
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,280
um then they they might be a little lost

162
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,039
in building actual secure software

163
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,000
so

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
as we can see building secure software

165
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,440
is challenging and we can see that by

166
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,919
going into even just open source

167
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,360
softwares like gitlab for example uh or

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,000
any other open source project they have

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,880
a ton of issues and these are all the

170
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,960
open issues in the gitlab project this

171
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,039
screenshot was taken a month ago i'm

172
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,680
sure it has increased by now but 40 000

173
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
issues that are that can be related to

174
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
code it can be related to ux it can be

175
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,280
related to

176
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,840
anything user store databases or

177
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,120
anything else

178
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
and then when we look at the security

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
issues so the issues that actually

180
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,199
concern security we have 6000 issues

181
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,360
open so do you really think a developer

182
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
has time to even think about all the bad

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,960
characters that could be included in an

184
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,120
input field maybe not they have

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
deadlines they have pressure and they

186
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,960
have 40 000 issues open

187
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
so let's start to build uh something

188
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,960
together and see how it

189
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,599
how that workflow happens so imagine you

190
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,240
want to build a cool website

191
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,960
and your cool website has a ton of

192
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,400
different users

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,120
so because it handles user data it needs

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,520
to be secured and if you are in your in

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
europe you need to do this according to

196
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
gdpr regulations

197
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,880
um

198
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
because of the user data the user data

199
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,280
that is handled is stored into this cool

200
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
database and this cool database of

201
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
course needs to be secured because you

202
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
want your user data to be entirely

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,199
secure

204
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,639
so you also need to secure the

205
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,240
communication between the website and

206
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
the cool database

207
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,000
now imagine this website runs on a

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,319
server somewhere uh or in a container

209
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,919
but we're gonna say that it's the same

210
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,520
thing because you know

211
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,479
simplify simplification um you need to

212
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,440
secure wherever it runs um

213
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,120
if whether it's a server or a container

214
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,319
or container inside a server or

215
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,800
container inside a vm inside a server

216
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,879
you need to secure this

217
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,039
and then your website is actually

218
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,520
communicating with a bunch of other

219
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,720
websites

220
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
um and maybe these websites are using

221
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
the same database so you need to secure

222
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
that as well and you need to make sure

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,720
that everything is fine

224
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,599
and this is fine so far

225
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,000
but imagine that all these containers or

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,799
servers and web servers and databases

227
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,200
are all communicating with each other

228
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,120
um

229
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,760
every day actively exchanging data you

230
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,360
need to make sure that this is secure

231
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,599
this is secure this is secure and

232
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,600
everything is fine now you've made sure

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
that everything was secure

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
but what if you missed the spot

235
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
you missed

236
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,680
securing

237
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
some database or you miss securing the

238
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
communication and some hacker actually

239
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,480
managed to break your security find one

240
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,680
entry point

241
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
because you missed that spot over there

242
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,320
and they are awesome

243
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,720
so they broke your your database and

244
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,560
they managed to leak all your secrets

245
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,399
and they're even uh maybe they deployed

246
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,680
ransomware

247
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
in your network and they're uh harassing

248
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,880
you for money against information

249
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,920
so as a developer i need to make 21

250
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
different locks think of all the ways my

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,080
application could get owned make the

252
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,480
application maintain the application and

253
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,959
actually bear with clients managers

254
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,519
deadlines and they are under a whole lot

255
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,040
of pressure

256
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,640
and as security professionals we are

257
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,880
under different kind of pressure but we

258
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,160
need to learn to emphasize with each

259
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,440
other

260
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,200
because as a hacker the only thing i

261
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,880
need to do is actually break the

262
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
application

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,200
and then my work is done

264
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
that i have a video over here but

265
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,600
it won't play with this format sorry but

266
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,320
this is the gist of the video

267
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,800
so why should security professionals

268
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
write code

269
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,600
compassion like i mentioned we work with

270
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,000
we work much better this way by

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,160
basically thinking in the other shoes

272
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,440
and trying to relate with one another

273
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,519
teach a person to fish and go fish

274
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,760
together um

275
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,399
little anecdotes when i was working

276
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,920
for some company

277
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,880
and i was giving a security training

278
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
like a basic security training to some

279
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,079
of the developers

280
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,720
web developers they had never heard of

281
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,360
owasp which is the open

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
source web application security um

283
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
basically repository of knowledge they

284
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,160
had never heard of this

285
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
so and when i was studying at tu delft

286
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,440
at

287
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
computer science software engineering

288
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
security was not really a part of

289
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,760
software engineering which would you

290
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,920
would think is kind of absurd

291
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,040
but actually now it is um they changed

292
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,519
it but when i was studying there they

293
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,000
prioritized more functionality

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,839
uh

295
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,120
performance and robustness those were

296
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,680
the pillars of software engineering

297
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,360
so what do we need to do well we need to

298
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,399
train our people so train developers uh

299
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
teach them those basic security concepts

300
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,200
share knowledge do code reviews get a

301
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
security professional to actually work

302
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,160
with the developers when they're doing

303
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,959
code reviews open communication channels

304
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,360
make it easy for developers and security

305
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
professionals to actually approach each

306
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
other

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,040
make them also feel welcome to to do so

308
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,880
work with developers to configure stuff

309
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,079
especially when you're working in

310
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,519
infrastructure you can have an

311
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,279
infrastruct team work with the

312
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,040
infrastructure team

313
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,880
and join the sprints have a security

314
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,240
professional who

315
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,720
is there when developers are actually

316
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,040
doing sprint reviews and reflections

317
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,760
so

318
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,000
thank you very much i am i think uh

319
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
this was pretty fast so we have time for

320
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,399
questions um

321
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,920
so if there are any questions feel free

322
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,480
to reach out and this is my twitter

323
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,399
handle by the way if you want to follow

324
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,440
or

325
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,000
things like this

326
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,200
chat for questions a few suggestions

327
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,560
were thrown

328
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
exactly i was wondering uh could you

329
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,920
tell us maybe a little bit about how

330
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,440
this attitude towards um developers

331
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,760
coming from security professionals

332
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,920
felt like for you i mean when you

333
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
started off did you first work as a

334
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,480
development and transitioned or did you

335
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
work

336
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,600
straight into the security domain and

337
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,639
then

338
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,639
you've reached this conclusion

339
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,160
just by seeing the interactions that

340
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
security professionals have with

341
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
developers

342
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,160
yeah so i worked uh i directly was in

343
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,040
and that's when um

344
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,880
yeah that's when i noticed that that

345
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,720
this was not only in my team but in

346
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,079
other

347
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,600
parts of the world basically

348
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,639
and maybe a follow-up to this um can you

349
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,079
tell us a bit about

350
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,180
some of the

351
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,480
[Music]

352
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
knowledge transfer methods that you've

353
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,040
seen implemented or maybe have been part

354
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,320
of that you think were the most

355
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
effective

356
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,519
um i know it's difficult for a huge

357
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,360
company to do this but what i really

358
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
liked in one of the companies i worked

359
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,519
with was that they trained everybody

360
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,399
literally everybody every new hire had a

361
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,639
security training but not only just some

362
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,639
security training you do in the system

363
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,240
and you don't even read the questions

364
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,519
you just feel the answers until

365
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,000
everything is right but more like the

366
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,959
security team was actually going to each

367
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,000
team and training them

368
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,920
to each new hire and that was really

369
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,639
nice so new hire trainings

370
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,519
uh

371
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,800
one thing we do at gitlab is

372
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
i mean everybody is on the same

373
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,440
chat so we're all on the same slack

374
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,560
and we have uh channels for developers

375
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,720
and security together

376
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,839
so

377
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
if they have a question or anything or

378
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,959
they want something reviewed they can

379
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,320
easily approach the security team

380
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,519
so these are two examples of

381
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,079
communication and training

382
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,240
yep um i'm curious

383
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,560
do you have any personal opinion on

384
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,680
whether

385
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,480
assigning roles and labels to our

386
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
knowledge base let's say or professional

387
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,519
know-how do you think that assigning the

388
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,120
label sort of pushes people to say

389
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,920
these concerns are not my job i will not

390
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,399
spend mental bandwidth on them and can

391
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,120
we do anything like within our power as

392
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,720
professionals to

393
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,040
transition from this label model into a

394
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,160
model where everyone is um

395
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,120
invested in thinking about even beyond

396
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,600
the boundaries of their very strict

397
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,160
skill set

398
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,360
tough questions

399
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,320
yeah i wonder about them a lot so

400
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
now i do think

401
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,279
i mean labels to some extent are needed

402
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,120
um

403
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
that's how humans work

404
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,680
but it's true that it sort of constricts

405
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
and restricts you to

406
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,440
like oh this is in the security box so

407
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,079
i'm not gonna worry about it

408
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,760
i think the best

409
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,000
yeah maybe one of the good ways to get

410
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,120
around that would be to

411
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,320
raise awareness in the sense that you

412
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,279
sort of tell the developers why it

413
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
should be their problem not how or what

414
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
but like why and make them reason like

415
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
for example um

416
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
try like code execution oh this is for

417
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,600
security to check if we have that but

418
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,759
tell them like okay if you implement

419
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,360
this this way then

420
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,279
it's vulnerable for this and this is

421
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,279
what can happen and it's it could

422
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,000
actually have been prevented long ago so

423
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
i think awareness on the y is uh would

424
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,079
be the answer

425
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,160
or a answer might not be the right one

426
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,079
but would help

427
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,160
yeah awareness on the y is so catchy and

428
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
it's going to stay stuck to my brain for

429
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
a long while now

430
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,320
um one thing i've seen work in in places

431
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,639
where i've worked before was

432
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,720
doing sort of competitions or games

433
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,199
cross teams and cross specialization so

434
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
that for example i i ended up playing

435
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,759
code golf as a security professional

436
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
with developers or with people from

437
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
incident response and

438
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
just getting your hands dirty and

439
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
something that's painful humanizes the

440
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,600
other person to you so that you feel

441
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,360
more comfortable approaching them right

442
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,480
yeah

443
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,800
that's true i mean any sort of team

444
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,120
building will help indeed to sort of

445
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
like lower the fences

446
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
um

447
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,079
yeah i mean

448
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,240
so i i work for like an all remote

449
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
company so we do these kind of uh

450
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,480
online gaming uh

451
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
things but in real life you could

452
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
definitely have like a meet and greet uh

453
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,839
event it can be it can feel awkward but

454
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,639
uh

455
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,560
it's always nice to get to to see the

456
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,279
faces behind the emails you keep or the

457
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,079
usernames you keep on complaining about

458
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,920
yeah and especially during the pandemic

459
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,240
it's really really tough to have these

460
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,119
human

461
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
connection moments anymore when

462
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,119
everything is like zoom and virtual

463
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,959
backgrounds i love yours by the way

464
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,359
i was also thinking about the coding

465
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,199
exercise that you put on recently and i

466
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,720
was trying to

467
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,679
embody a person who perhaps hasn't gone

468
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,839
through the software development

469
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,400
education curriculum right and they're

470
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,160
seeing that exercise and maybe they feel

471
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,640
sort of intimidated and saying oh i know

472
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,559
in theory you know if i were to do this

473
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,240
in in the command line i know how i

474
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,840
would escape it but

475
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
i don't know how to build it i don't

476
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,400
know how to write the code and um i've

477
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,520
sort of seen this overcome at times by

478
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,760
coder dojo practices

479
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,080
where you have an exercise and people

480
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,799
take turns writing a few lines of code

481
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,280
each but they don't have to write them

482
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
like from their own heads they can take

483
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,640
input from the others as long as they're

484
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,559
doing the physical motion and being sort

485
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,960
of in charge of writing those lines

486
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,520
you can sort of help them get closer to

487
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,679
the feeling of oh i have agency i can

488
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,960
learn this i can handle this right

489
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,760
yeah

490
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,360
that's uh

491
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,200
that's indeed sounds like indeed like a

492
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,960
psychological trait to get people

493
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,320
invested

494
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,440
so that that's that definitely works

495
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,160
um but for for someone with

496
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,000
at least for this example for someone

497
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,160
with no coding knowledge i would say um

498
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,320
even think think you don't have to think

499
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
about about it in code terms but even in

500
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,200
studio code or just sentences like i

501
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,840
want to ping this ip address i want the

502
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,720
user to accept this input or something

503
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,080
you can just say that

504
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
in in terms like just describe what you

505
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,120
want the program to do and

506
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,760
and think uh how to secure that sorry

507
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,880
about the dog

508
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,039
oh it's absolutely fine um i was very

509
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,160
curious um in your experience when you

510
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
have like in one hand this kind of

511
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,600
um making everyone aware of more than

512
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
the boundaries of their own job right

513
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,640
you have this in one hand and then on

514
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,080
the other hand you have

515
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
tooling and automated checkers and

516
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,960
linters and you know um things that

517
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,440
automate part of the job for you

518
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,600
um on the other hand right

519
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,440
it's absolutely true that a combination

520
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
of both will give you the best results

521
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
but i'm really curious in your

522
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,320
experience how whether you've seen

523
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,720
any um indication that some people are

524
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,320
better at implementing one than the

525
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,559
other and what kind of profile that ties

526
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,640
into so is that is it like small

527
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
companies are better at doing the human

528
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,200
responsibility side and larger companies

529
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,520
are better at the tooling side or is it

530
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,120
something even more

531
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,080
complex than that

532
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,000
i would think it's it's more complex

533
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,240
i do notice that the smaller companies

534
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
nowadays are startups they tend to do

535
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,840
more

536
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,919
uh merging of the security and

537
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,240
development team that that security is

538
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,919
already at the beginning because they

539
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,000
can't afford the nexus

540
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,799
license or something like this

541
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,080
but um

542
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,159
yeah i do notice that in bigger

543
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,919
companies where they can afford these

544
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,679
automated tools and stuff that they sort

545
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,960
of lose the manual checks so everybody

546
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
just

547
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
runs the automated tools then they check

548
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
for a couple of days the results and

549
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,480
stuff but they they don't really dig

550
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,919
deeper

551
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,880
um

552
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
so maybe it is correlated um

553
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,080
depending on the size so yeah the bigger

554
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
at least it might be because of them

555
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,960
affording the tools basically that if

556
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,320
you can afford the tools you start and

557
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
you buy all those tools you sort of lose

558
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,039
the the idea of manual checking and

559
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,799
actually digging deep into one

560
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,760
vulnerability or something like this

561
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,520
thank you very much for your input i

562
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,559
really love this discussion and uh if we

563
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,039
had all been in person i'm sure the demo

564
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,880
of building a ping together would have

565
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,840
gone

566
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,559
uh in a much more interactive manner um

567
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,159
here's to hoping that next year we can

568
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,360
do this again

569
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,840
and hopefully have a room full of people

570
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,480
offering suggestions other than don't

571
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,039
use python

572
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,080
yeah

573
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,640
everybody uses python every security

574
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
not that they want to admit it but yeah

575
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,080
thank you very much valentine it's been

576
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
a pleasure having you on

577
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,159
thank you so much bye

578
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,880
bye
