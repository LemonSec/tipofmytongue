1
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:22,090
thanks for hanging out it's really cool
to be here talking about this because

2
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:27,910
this is my first not terribly technical
talk or close to bursting it at a

3
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,329
security conference and definitely the
first I've talked about sides so call

4
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,850
for this talk comes out of me tell you I
am first I have been the field for eight

5
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,469
years on paper but half my life in
reality it started going to Dec 26 under

6
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:50,449
when I was 15 I have seen an awful lot
between now and again and it's been

7
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:53,659
interesting that watched our community
grow up from being crazy little trolley

8
00:00:53,659 --> 00:01:00,050
brats to now we have children the
children and so it's been cool cuz I've

9
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,199
seen a lot of different stuff I'm really
fascinated by security beyond the

10
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,149
typical use case so I'm really tired of
protecting people's money it gets old

11
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,470
I'll do it because it pays me money but
I feel like there's a reason for

12
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,510
security to go beyond that there are
ways that we can make people feel safe

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,830
using the same technology its or the
steam your mindset that are just limited

14
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,050
to protecting your credit cards just
think it's a little boring and I'm also

15
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,280
a landlord's I have owned a house and
May 2009 I've been renting rooms out and

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
it's a really interesting way to meet a
hole like slice of humanity wanna go

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,809
ahead and meet the guy who's getting
high on spice in your spare bedroom when

18
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,360
you have a very quick you meet that
person you want to meet all sorts of

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,590
different human beings transients
usually because I am a house in Virginia

20
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,060
so I got a lot of people who are in
unfamiliar six-month stays because they

21
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,230
were there are new to the area finding
something stable and I gotta get to know

22
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,350
a lot of really cool people and so far
no start by talking about a really cool

23
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,539
people named Mark who stayed with me and
is really the basis behind this whole

24
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,649
story because I had to learn how to help
mark and it was really really cool and a

25
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,010
privilege to be offered the opportunity
to help him in that

26
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,019
gonna talk about mark porn addiction in
general because I think that you know we

27
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,470
don't want to stigmatize normal human
sexual behavior so the difference

28
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,319
between good porn and like too much for
and we'll talk about that how I was able

29
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,339
to help mark so what worked and what
didn't because when you're doing that

30
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,440
you definitely need to talk about it
what technologies we used what

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,269
difference it had in his live and then
some general thoughts about addiction so

32
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:48,769
I always love talking about mark because
he was a little interesting mix of

33
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,209
contradictions he just graduated his
master's degree he had come out of like

34
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,790
military-industrial complex thought
patterns and then he was back in the

35
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,690
real world and his religious faith was
driving him more towards human services

36
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,959
or other connecting things and he was
really kind of in a weird place and he

37
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,739
was also really conflicted about we'll
get to that Marquez a greenhouse me for

38
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,250
a really long time he would have great
weeks incredibly but this is normal

39
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,060
house me it's you just kind of like you
know roll with it but then market into a

40
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,590
really bad mood and he stayed in a
really bad mood for a really long time

41
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,959
and I didn't know what was going on with
Mark I just know that mark was this

42
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,970
great big black hole of energy setting
up space in my living room and I just

43
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,220
can't deal with that i mean he was
seriously I felt like I was getting sick

44
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,040
being around him because it was just
like him so negative in me picking up

45
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,448
where they're going and he was actually
doing things that are normally a kick

46
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:51,669
out of fences in my house like starting
drama between me and other house man you

47
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:54,709
know kind of those things right this
awesome housemaid who I like a lot but

48
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,859
something's not great so we had talked
the talk and you need to fix your shit I

49
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:04,669
need to move out and not talk went
pretty well because a few days later you

50
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:09,090
know he can to me and he told me that he
needed help and that the reason he was

51
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,699
so cranky all the time is because he
couldn't stop at the airport and I know

52
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,549
that there can be a lot of like Snickers
that you know porn right you're supposed

53
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,340
to look at porn porn is great I have no
problem with pornography

54
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,520
the problem is is that

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,870
and hit criteria 12 in 30 is preoccupied
to the port of obsession he would spend

56
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,440
12 hours a day looking for that one
image and it's really sad you know it's

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,849
like he was in a lot of pain just like
one picture that one picture and I'm

58
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,770
gonna spend eleven hours getting there
so he wasn't having a good time he

59
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,180
couldn't keep himself not doing it and
he was about to get kicked out of it

60
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,610
perhaps visiting all three of his
criteria there is another way of

61
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,470
thinking about it which is the more
twelve-step version I pulled up in terms

62
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,389
of knowing if you got a porn problem so
the three criteria before my thing this

63
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,130
is another way of thinking about it and
it was it was just he was about to get

64
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,860
kicked out of his house so it was it was
one of those things where when he came

65
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,330
to me and he asked me to block his
internet so that he could not get tube

66
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,800
porn I was like ok I have some skin in
the game here I like to live in this

67
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,719
house I like to have a pleasant life in
my house I don't want to replace it at

68
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:26,000
it and I actually really like mark you
know when he's being a good house make

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,860
it a great house me so we you know the
part of the negotiation was how do we

70
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,440
negotiate me helping him in that way in
a way that's good for him and for me so

71
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,400
he needs to feel safe coming to me and
be able to tell me hey I need you to

72
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,750
block this additional sites like i buy
it accidentally and I need to be able to

73
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,759
say to him not right now I'm at work you
know get back to you later

74
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,159
Wildcats blocks what that list of sizes
or not that was really important because

75
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:59,060
we found out we couldn't block we
couldn't allow HTTPS because things will

76
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,139
go on but I couldn't block my device so
it was kinda like when those things were

77
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,610
having a realistic expectation what will
happen if the sponsee subvert the block

78
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:19,020
I am no one's mother and I am not at all
interested in playing and playing who

79
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,799
does you know if you do this I'm gonna
smack you I'm just not interested I got

80
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,409
other things to do so he and I agreed
that that was just gonna be if you want

81
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,520
to read it you don't need my help
anyways let's move on but you know you

82
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,210
may have different negotiations and then
what other support so depending on

83
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,258
on what structure you have in the
relationship you have with that person

84
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,250
there may be other things you choose to
do I get here in a twelve-step program

85
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,160
has a lot of different stuff that
happens and I don't that dynamic that

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,310
you might choose to have that person I
don't have a right or wrong here I don't

87
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,949
really care but my thing is that you
have to really clear on expectations if

88
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,400
you're going to offer that kind of
support because you don't want to cosign

89
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,780
someone else's bullshit and you
definitely don't want to set yourself up

90
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,948
for being so emotionally invested that
it matters to the point where it really

91
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:19,870
destroy you if that person relapses or
goes back their own behavior are getting

92
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,259
not because of mark either just WOW when
you start doing this it gets complicated

93
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:29,120
he knew what he wanted to go look at and
he was ok with not looking at stuff if

94
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,820
it meant you could look at thing if he
would I love looking at that stuff will

95
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,969
be able to look at stuff you don't want
to see so having to take away TPS he was

96
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,610
fine with just that restricting to some
very very limited sites like writing

97
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,530
poetry or some cool stuff and write it
was really supportive but he wanted it

98
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,409
really restricted he agreed he would not
try and get around me the thing that was

99
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:53,919
interesting about Marcus he's not a
security person and he's really not very

100
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,490
techincal so he was able to be managed
with just adjusting the router now if I

101
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,610
had a more sophisticated user I would
use a different technology so that's

102
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,810
kind of like important to think through
is like okay how much my committed to

103
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,099
going around giving you that feeling of
just a little bit better than you as you

104
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,900
want to make sure you that meet the
user's level I didn't have any issue

105
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,388
with getting access to that which was
important I want to play with it which I

106
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,729
did he would not be annoyed if it took
me a couple days to get to something but

107
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:30,229
I would get to it and so I did not like
having additional layers I just really

108
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,149
focused on the technical aspects of
helping mark have a little bit more room

109
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:42,120
to breathe every day and so because we
had a really clear idea of what needed

110
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,870
to be done

111
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,529
we were going had we knew we were doing
a whitelist an approach and I did it on

112
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:57,189
the router the problem with that is that
a really credit rather someone you might

113
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,710
want to upgrade your route or it is
actually really obnoxious to have to log

114
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,830
into I think it was a link and like I
just the little Lions and I'm like yeah

115
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,750
I know it seems kind of princess Eve but
there were things I couldn't filter so I

116
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,260
couldn't give him access to
mail.google.com because he would end up

117
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,630
with all the porn ads which is you know
not so very perhaps you know I realized

118
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,980
after that I could have just installed a
hard email client to just allow him

119
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,640
access to those parts for webmail

120
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:33,279
TV but I do realize it at the time so as
a source of frustration for me so

121
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,710
usually it was just a resource issue in
terms of me being able to get to things

122
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:42,860
quickly and I really didn't like doing
the administration and so I decided I

123
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,380
want to try and do something that was
marked post oriented that might be

124
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,710
easier for me

125
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:53,970
internet nanny nanny is interesting and
I first went to go ahead and give them a

126
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,500
shout out for seriously and caring
enough about people to offer their

127
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,029
product for free to people who are
dealing with this kind of problem and

128
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:05,720
they were really cool I emailed them
they said the code was likely that this

129
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,700
works I don't have to keep log into the
router and I downloaded and installed it

130
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:26,040
and unfortunately like yahoo is poorer
and I'm like go check it cause I don't

131
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,900
want to have to see what he thinks is
interesting right and and he was like

132
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,730
his face two inches and it all and I'm
like ok

133
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,660
and I thought that because he ran into
these ads are not using that kind of ads

134
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,069
like this which is really common across
Yahoo so it's really sucks because I

135
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,529
really like that many people have a lot
of respect for the human beings who work

136
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:52,970
there but the product doesn't work very
well and I mean it didn't stop anything

137
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,060
for the pain uninstall which is
considered a feature not a bug that

138
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,180
destroys the ass that it's not a future
it's a bag and I was really worried

139
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,939
about that and it and i know i think
that it's it's kind of like the same

140
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,420
problem

141
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,329
other content filtering is only as good
as what you know I'm really kind of

142
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:16,540
leaning towards liking OpenDNS that's
going for the sort of thing because it's

143
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,839
got the Roman client I can stick it on
the block will be enough I'm not there

144
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,720
to see if I want to be like kids are
smart and smarter than you know it's

145
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,350
late I really need for that because it's
got a Roman client didn't go with your

146
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,839
devices anywhere but there's really not
a great way to do it here if you're

147
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,050
dealing with something that's compulsive
like sex addiction specifically

148
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:48,740
pornography addiction you need to block
it if you're gonna get it all things I

149
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,880
used to block so I also have a problem
with using the internet just a little

150
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,449
bit too much and sometimes I've got
other things I should be doing or not

151
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:02,569
looking at it works like Facebook the
price of the stock amount of things that

152
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:06,099
I learned to manage my own behavior so
they'd be more successful at work

153
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,500
environments haven't used the newspaper
until control but it's really important

154
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,050
to know its content filtering and
already installed on your machine you

155
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,060
don't have to do any work which I'm a
big fan of course I am lazy OpenDNS is

156
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,000
my favorite thing right now I mean even
though you're still subject to

157
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,120
deactivation you can do in that stuff at
the border to Vegas and remember you

158
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,589
only got to be one step better than your
usergroup so it's not like has to be

159
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:36,240
rockettes I really like self-control not
draw yes I'll control I have her back

160
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,709
because it's just so much more
comfortable and cold turkey for Windows

161
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,489
7 trying to work I'll use that

162
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,700
that was really the same sort of thing
right if I'm having a problem looking at

163
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,600
porn when a blockade of having a problem
with the internet all day instead of

164
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,440
doing my work but a block at I know you
guys are done it to you know and it's

165
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,230
just like I want to be productive
there's all these things that I would

166
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,779
really like to do about that and so
there's there's tons more options the

167
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:09,060
professional versions are better hi I
kind of feel like I don't want to work

168
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,130
too hard on my home network connection
like I feel like it should just work and

169
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,100
I should be able to do all that fun
stuff at home and then I might actually

170
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,010
do some work on computers so there is
the option of installing scorecard I

171
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,209
know there's a bunch of different other
router and about style implementations

172
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:31,589
it depends on how ciskei user bases and
how much work you want to do and so the

173
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:36,399
thing about helping mark is that while
his you know incredibly fulfilling an

174
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,810
important to me that I was able to help
him in that way but I was helping him

175
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,920
with is giving him that ten minutes that
little bit of time to break a breather

176
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,349
that he could work on the other things
in his life I did not fix anything from

177
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,610
our I just helped mark have a chance to
think about things for himself and so it

178
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,860
was kinda like I really feel like
understanding the reason why mark would

179
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,240
be doing that mark was doing or even you
know a smoker would be doing what

180
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,120
they're doing and alcoholic you like
that word with their ending what they're

181
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,920
doing

182
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,790
underlying addiction model stuff and
this particular have any of you heard

183
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:24,569
about rap Park ok that makes it even
better to Lake you take a bunch of and

184
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,980
you stick them in cages and given the
option to press one button for like

185
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,990
really awesome strong drugs like cocaine
and the other buttons for playing water

186
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,310
and there's nothing to do

187
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,279
like putting your teenagers in middle
america they're gonna go to Mass

188
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:46,019
you they did a lot a lot from the diet
drugs and that was like proof that you

189
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,779
know if you try this drug you're going
to end up addicted to it you're gonna do

190
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,350
it till you die there was like our
advertising I think the just say no or

191
00:14:53,350 --> 00:15:01,680
the brain frying him that is related to
that really sucks and so this dude

192
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,989
brusque Alexander in the nineteen
seventies went well that research seems

193
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,709
kind of fly because you're putting
wrapping he does and they're not happy

194
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,119
about that

195
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,040
well okay let's try making right heaven
or wrapped her and seriously oh my god

196
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:24,319
the result so you put in with other arab
girl raps and their baby rats and you

197
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:29,009
give them things to climb on and run and
you give them Lake social opportunities

198
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:33,519
they can do all of the rat behaviors and
they can have the right connections and

199
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,889
they don't want drugs so much and it's
really cool so it's like if you look at

200
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:41,170
any addiction it really comes down the
stuff like this when you're working with

201
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,610
anyone it's just like let me go ahead
and figure out how to make their lives

202
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,800
better so that they can go ahead and not
spend all their time doing drugs are

203
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,819
looking at porn or whatever is going on
and the chart on the left is the tape

204
00:15:56,819 --> 00:16:01,410
the occasional the ones who are not you
know did have anything to do in things

205
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,649
that for them but a lot of drugs and the
ones with the dashed lines one who did

206
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:10,279
have friends and things to do and
running around they didn't do so much

207
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,699
drugs and if you look at the end of the
theory of harm reduction I'm not

208
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:19,930
necessarily trying to convince anyone to
stop looking at porn has your gonna look

209
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,359
at porn sometimes anyway just by looking
at ads but to stop it being a problem

210
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,670
for them that they have to do it all the
time so like all of this stuff all the

211
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,969
different research on that addiction is
like get people connected to other

212
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,730
people help them be happier and I went
ahead and put a list not because I'm a

213
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:45,009
fan of groups ok before I toggle to the
side by sides really fast so it's

214
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,040
definitely not going to be the longest
out there

215
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,649
r all of those groups involved
connecting with each other they're

216
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:56,589
having different obligations volunteer
giving back as much as getting is really

217
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:02,029
really important things so it doesn't
really matter what you do you don't have

218
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:05,380
to do any of those groups as long as you
do something related to connecting with

219
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,010
other people you're meeting your use
case but if you're trying to do things

220
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,790
to connect with other people and you
just can't get out the door to do it

221
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:17,319
there's options are you don't have to go
with a group you know I feel like we

222
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,649
really do heavily pushed twelve-step in
this country and I know people were very

223
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,750
happy with it but I also know that you
know as an atheist I have a real problem

224
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,400
with that and so it's just it's
important to know that it's not really

225
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,220
anyone's fault if they end up with an
addiction mark is doing a lot better now

226
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,720
mark is he's no longer compulsively
looking at porn you know he's moving

227
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,820
forward in his life you know and I don't
deserve credit for that all I did was

228
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,020
move things out of his way and when he
had that when you add a little bit more

229
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:54,580
room to breathe he did it for himself so
it was cause it's like marks doing a lot

230
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,309
little bit better and he also found
social stuff he's connected with other

231
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:04,559
people you know it doesn't matter what
you do it's just their options and all

232
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:14,428
the same thing anyway so yeah totally
birthday my sides like almost done so

233
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:19,330
security perspective really realizing
that I don't have to be that much better

234
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,689
than my customer that was relaxing you
know it's like I know that they're gonna

235
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,250
try and be a little brats and that's ok
we love them anyway we pat them on the

236
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,690
head we send them home but I don't
really have to work that hard to do with

237
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:36,890
most of them so that was just kind of
relaxing in general white lifting it up

238
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,730
and the bug like I had to do so much
administration over had to keep mark set

239
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:47,049
up the way it need to be that by the end
of it I was going let's try to Net Nanny

240
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:51,690
seriously you know they're often but I
knew that I was just at the point where

241
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,040
I just needed a lighter-weight
technology

242
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,560
a network we have access this technology
is you know and at home we might need to

243
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:06,440
download things they didn't have
installed or buy them the porn thing you

244
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,390
know when I was looking at those ads
going well it's awful lot of exposure to

245
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,650
pornography in the day life you know I
know some people will be like you are

246
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,410
over socializing our kids but you know
what seriously kids go there every day

247
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,690
we heard over sexualizing our kids so
that was kind of sad and disturbing and

248
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,460
bothersome because I mean I saw his face
completely change and it went from being

249
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,580
like this guy who I really think it's
cool and I didn't mind doing this for

250
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:40,830
still don't too well as I away away away
in terms of architecture like I really

251
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,899
had to think where I would put different
things did I want to do it on the border

252
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,420
device that I want to do it on the
endpoint what sort of things that he

253
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,160
want me to block like I have another
customer coming up

254
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,880
customer person who's asked me to work
with them and they want time specific

255
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,420
blocking so they want to be able to go
to work

256
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,320
do their work and then have stuff turned
off as I've got a pretty good idea what

257
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,790
I'm gonna do for that customer probably
gonna be a DNS and then maybe you know

258
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:10,450
roll it out because this is the most
things for this isn't hard you know I

259
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,550
didn't invent anything this is all stuff
that everyone knows how to do but what I

260
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,590
found meaningful about it actually did
something for a person and it made a

261
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,730
difference for how so it's like I can go
ahead and focus on all the cool nerdy

262
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,150
stuff and you know all the high-tech and
cool stuff I'd rather focus on like the

263
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:35,910
Human Services aspects as they relate to
technology this week and yeah just like

264
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,600
compassion like I have been around
addiction for a really long time just

265
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,980
you know connected to people who deal
stuff and I've definitely use the

266
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:49,740
internet more than has been helpful to
me and just like it was I really hadn't

267
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,340
seen that look on someone's face I
hadn't seen the

268
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:01,439
and see what it was really like for
someone else to really see what it did

269
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,159
to have like the real-world hey I'm
gonna kick you out of my house because

270
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,429
you're making me sick like I've never
had to say that to someone before and i

271
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:13,490
know i will never have to say it again
and so the real-world impact of that you

272
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,549
know his misery and the world around
them it really does suck on that it's a

273
00:21:17,549 --> 00:22:06,918
problem that should be taken seriously

274
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:20,970
going to see this so I'm sorry heart
fully

275
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:27,789
very low tack and I had an athlete issue
so he had a machine that was and didn't

276
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:31,330
run very well and had an old install
windows so it didn't run very well and I

277
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,949
couldn't fix it because of it except
that it would become my problem kind of

278
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:57,080
like it's yours

279
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:31,879
now but for some people money is
motivating you $20 million dollar rides

280
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,380
everyday don't have a cigarette that's
one way to motivate but I would not

281
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,740
spend my time trying to help someone
with this if I didn't know that they

282
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,750
genuinely wanted to work on it like I am
NOT mom and I'm not getting sucked into

283
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,020
it so if someone if you came to me
mister have an effect I really just need

284
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,580
to make it though I can't do this I have
no idea what I do better than me but I

285
00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:09,189
figure it out

286
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:21,280
me because when they run the one thing I
hate about his schedule and that's kind

287
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,300
of irritating but self-control a top I
run it and I don't know what I'd have to

288
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,389
uninstall untangle the get out like it
makes it pretty clear that it's not

289
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,110
going to go away and then it's not that
straightforward to get out and I don't

290
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,459
do forensics really like I can do a
little friends I don't want to work that

291
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,780
hard so I don't mess with it you know so
it's just the need to be a little bit

292
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,540
higher than your own desire for getting
on the internet that quickly and plus

293
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:55,940
you also like how serious is it for you
because you can go get a smartphone then

294
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,050
go to the library then go to work and
get away with it had like that at work

295
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:07,490
so yeah alright

296
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:17,820
traded in for like you know nine but my
phone was yeah now I understand with

297
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,689
iPhones there's some stuff you can do
with kids restraints thing is if you

298
00:25:22,690 --> 00:27:07,309
have a web browser your kind of open
door

299
00:27:07,309 --> 00:28:01,499
together
