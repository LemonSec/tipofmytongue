1
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:27,710
already hello this is the last talked
attractive believe it or not and maybe

2
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:35,870
in a new I got the last August attract
new the security market anyway so I'm

3
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:45,239
Tom ruff little bit about me first off
big thank you to fire off for sponsoring

4
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:53,159
much of this kind of gone too far out
more about me my first computer was a

5
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:59,589
Commodore VIC 20 I had to mow about 21
yards to pay for it back in the

6
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:06,229
mid-eighty's as I started in the
software world I was a system

7
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:16,100
administrator for Sun OS who knows what
thats called now Solaris UTS which was

8
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:24,679
examined frank and obviously landings as
I progressed I moved in the software

9
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:37,130
development I started using K&R see
anybody know K&R see no nobody I did

10
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,490
some assembly on system 39 E

11
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:45,240
did the hardware Cisco did emulates
instructions IBM would add a new

12
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,929
obstruction to the instruction said we
didn't have time to redo the chips cuz

13
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,310
it took about three and a half months
when you change the CPUs so we would

14
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,970
write code to emulate what that new
instruction was supposed to do so I did

15
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,960
that for a while then I moved into Java
in web development and then at some

16
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,250
point along the way I realized that
security was lacking in needed more

17
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,489
focus so it's a little bit about me

18
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:14,610
the disclaimer

19
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,320
and I'm gonna do this a little more
visually so today I was trying to decide

20
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,560
what certain way for this for this but
the opinions in this talk do not

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:33,020
represent represent fire way shape or
form so I can wear must assert they do

22
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,040
not reflect the opinion that's gotta
come on so I'm not wear a mustache shirt

23
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,640
so I went with something I like and it's
also true that the bottom so we're all

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,769
good as it goes on if something bothers
you if you don't like my political views

25
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,390
please feel free to go to track one
there's somebody talking over there to

26
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:03,839
write short agenda have a quick
introduction and then broke it up into

27
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,980
two topics you don't know what you don't
know and how can you be human nature and

28
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,700
we wrap it up and we have any questions
along the way there are six trivia

29
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,369
questions if you can answer any of them
correctly you will be rewarded with

30
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:30,950
something that I'm pretty sure you like
introduction of us who are now in

31
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,440
security or insecurity for a while we
look at some of these vulnerabilities

32
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,739
that come across the sea bees or
whatever and we think how in the world

33
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:47,650
did a developer be dumb enough to let
that happen I would like to suggest

34
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,269
through this talk those things happen in
a very similar way to the top or

35
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:57,060
governmental decisions at the federal
level i didnt pick on these days I stick

36
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,260
at the federal level so if we look at
the past few years published

37
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,579
vulnerabilities they just keep going up

38
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:13,540
4150 5278 statistically that's pretty
well level and then it goes up again by

39
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,298
almost 50 percent in 2014

40
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,650
so I spent a lot of time looking at the
Linux kernel

41
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,179
respected here

42
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,900
in 2011 the Linux kernel was 13.5
million lines of code predominantly and

43
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,229
see as it has risen eighteen million
lines of code over the past four years

44
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:42,389
the number of vulnerabilities reported
they weren't all Linux vulnerabilities

45
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:53,130
obviously but the numbers gone up
significantly so the first thing i wanna

46
00:04:53,130 --> 00:05:01,520
talk about its cost so what is the cost
on the language and are written for the

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,530
longest amount of time professionally
job job originated in nineteen nineties

48
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:18,049
created by James Gosling member of Sun
Microsystems they created what was

49
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,820
called the Java Virtual Machine for
those of you who aren't familiar with

50
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,800
the Java Virtual Machine it sits on top
of the operating system and interprets

51
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,750
instructions are written so that you can
run it on any platform one of the big

52
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,460
things when Java first came out

53
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,090
developers used to always always always
complain about memory management have to

54
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,479
allocate memory I gotta do something
with it and I got throw it away for me

55
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,010
reading somewhere that broadway Java was
touted to free developers from the heart

56
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,479
aches and memory management was
something called the garbage collector

57
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,659
will talk about in a few minutes it was
also touted his ride it wants use it

58
00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:04,949
everywhere so you could write it one
time you could run on Linux Windows I

59
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:10,340
did you actually do some coding for a
while and I was too

60
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:18,909
which we do now

61
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:28,000
windows here always to a culture and a
project between IBM and Microsoft IBM

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,490
was a primary piece of the Microsoft
contributed to it and then Microsoft

63
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:39,720
Word our business initially was an
interpreted language so that means you

64
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,229
were not component to machine code you
actually compile Java programs to adopt

65
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,349
class but it was just a representation
that there had to be interpreted by the

66
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:55,820
virtual machine before I got rain
compared the cast party in a minute but

67
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,840
I would like to compare that to
Obamacare Obamacare originated the first

68
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,789
term of President Barack Obama
healthcare insurance issuer provided by

69
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,169
the federal government in one way or
another

70
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,500
provides accurate to what they were
calling the healthcare epidemic all

71
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,050
these people who didn't have insurance

72
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,139
touted as by all means use it everywhere
so anybody who needed it could use it

73
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,240
promised lawyer health care costs
because then you don't have the the

74
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,160
people in the health care industry
having to go chase people down when I

75
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,750
didn't have insurance for thousands and
thousands of dollars where they end up

76
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,930
writing it off twenty years later

77
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,990
originally available in 2014 and the
initial interpretation was that

78
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:46,930
individuals can keep their existing
coverage without penalty so trivia

79
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:54,550
question number one whose opinion is not
expressed in the next lot what I said

80
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:08,430
about connie Hedegaard can catch

81
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:33,789
and it was all I needed was one so so as
we call it a little more are coming this

82
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:39,689
summer for that allow the height of the
stage like me you're not used to being

83
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:47,080
talked about Java for a second I said it
was interpreted which means every

84
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,590
instruction had to be converted from the
language it was the end which is Java

85
00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:00,700
bytecode and ran on inside the virtual
machine as native code so when I first

86
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:08,680
came out of 10 2011 interpreted Java
cost was about 16 to 20 times the CPU of

87
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,459
a comparable native application even if
I wrote it in something awful like

88
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,790
Pascal it still took about sixteen 16 to
20 times the CPU in Java than it would

89
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,219
in passing out numbers were even a
little better than that in see so it's

90
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:31,480
like 20 to 24 times until Java 7 every
Java core class was loaded as soon as

91
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,340
you started up the JVM the JVM didn't
know what you needed it didn't look at

92
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,530
the code it was interpreted it was
reading it as it goes like the script so

93
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,949
every Java class that you put in your
classpath was getting loaded so even to

94
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,630
just do a simple hello world on a
console it's at least 200 k around my

95
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,250
first computer that we're talking about
a little while ago only had 16 J

96
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:02,630
so that's a huge difference and I was
writing entire games text based games

97
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:10,910
just to say hello or over 200 K so in
like kindness if we look at Obamacare

98
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:17,880
the massive undertaking of getting the
Obamacare brokerage side online

99
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,710
was months late primarily blamed on
contractors and had numerous security

100
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:30,910
vulnerabilities now you've all seen them
on top of their adding to the

101
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,050
individuals cost those people who who
did have really nice insurance policies

102
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,699
from from wonderful employers like fire
are now being charged the luxury tax

103
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,440
because our insurance is better than
what Obamacare is you'll see it as a lot

104
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,230
out of them on your w-2 at the end of
the year so cost you extra money

105
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:59,080
continuing on the same line of thought
to remove the burden of memory

106
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,020
management job the garbage collector
goes around he looks for stuff is no

107
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:13,630
longer being use all the way up until
Java 6 which was twelve years after job

108
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,650
came out every time the garbage
collector had to run the entire process

109
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,340
had to stop so it would come around he
started running low on memory it's a

110
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:31,280
stop hold up around collect all the old
pointers free up that memory and then

111
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:38,000
you start all over again so for those of
us do and near real-time development for

112
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,310
those of you doing websites your website
just stopped long enough for it to do

113
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,930
the cleanup and you'd see these
unexpected pauses in your application

114
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:58,010
that you had no explanation for so long
that same lines as the different

115
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:05,470
versions of Java came out on top 24 Java
5 again adding all these extra tweaks to

116
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,230
the garbage collector to try to make it
better I have literally been paid

117
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:16,860
thousands and thousands of dollars doing
nothing

118
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:23,120
tuning the Java garbage collector trying
to make those policies that you run into

119
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,939
smaller playing with the heap size
playing with the

120
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:40,579
playing with the reminder of how how far
is it let the memory kit for before it

121
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:47,348
runs they are so I added a sweet
mechanism that would actually catch some

122
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,619
of the local variables and Fritos up
without having to stop the JVM but still

123
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:56,579
even in java which has been out for just
a few months if you push the memory for

124
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:03,459
now if you have a start the world
everything just hold on I gotta go free

125
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:08,819
up some space I can keep running

126
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:14,019
comparing that against Obamacare sign of
trauma care were stopped until some time

127
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:24,759
of this some of the security
vulnerabilities were reported here text

128
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:31,389
and just as a side note parts of the
application for the Obamacare site were

129
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:36,729
written in Java haven't had a chance to
look at it and it's too soon to tell if

130
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:45,470
the site will actually get better it's
slow it's bulky its expenses and just

131
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,140
wasn't very well done

132
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:57,830
last comparison here even though the
developers have now been freed from

133
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:04,880
memory management leak still happen you
create a variable in a much larger scope

134
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,280
than you're supposed to a global
variable or a static variable that its

135
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,480
allocated as soon as a program starts
running the resource leak still happen

136
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,990
we have applications of fire that run
for awhile and you see the memory creep

137
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,860
creep creep creep up and then the
operations team has to come back and say

138
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,910
hey restart service and then you start
back down here again in overtime it just

139
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:41,319
creeps up so it's still a problem even
though job a promise to fix it with

140
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,560
their I would like to say in Java's
defense now that Evans I hear that most

141
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,810
of the security vulnerabilities are
found are with the JVM itself or with

142
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,880
the application that was written it's
not against the language itself language

143
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,410
itself doesn't have any built-in
vulnerabilities on the Obamacare aside

144
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:11,839
error message up almost every company in
health insurance company now has a plan

145
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,680
that fits under Obamacare and they're
really hard to tell them apart yet you

146
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:24,258
can get charged from low to high it's
worse than buying a car really is

147
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:33,269
now trivia question number two for those
of you who might have been around a Java

148
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:39,709
for a while what is the name of the
graphics toolkit and Java 10 and 11 and

149
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:51,669
I'll give you a hint it's not something
that couples do anybody nothing answer

150
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:57,100
bail me out

151
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:14,499
double windows 1998 these second job a
windowing talk yet also known as the

152
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:20,879
abstract windowing toolkit was the first
one in it was replaced by something

153
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:34,910
called Java Swing

154
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:41,319
ok so I'll save that one so whoever
entered the last year the question right

155
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:52,820
gets to moving on Java was created with
good intentions Obamacare was created

156
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,830
with good intentions for the most part
was created to make it easier to develop

157
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:04,220
software for many platforms if you go to
Java wine which I've been to three times

158
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,060
you'll see a blasted everywhere

159
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,780
Java on 1 billion devices worldwide and
its true runs on farms around on

160
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:22,510
microwaves it runs on blu-ray players
PCs Macs servers you can find job for it

161
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:28,160
if you really want to run it whether or
not you do to you when it is available

162
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:36,120
on the other side Obamacare was created
to help some people provide health

163
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,179
insurance for those who can afford it

164
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,330
orkut and get it cuz they worked three
part-time jobs instead of a full-time

165
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:48,909
job but on both sides the true cost of
it was a Java created new extreme

166
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:55,400
demands on RAM and CPU 200 k to say
hello world ranking up a JBoss web

167
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:06,440
server takes at least six gigs RAM CPU
ours you know single-core not an option

168
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:13,990
anymore it's increased greatly from the
federal budget point of view Obamacare

169
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:19,990
is already way over projected costs in
the first two years but in in this both

170
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,780
of these cases adoptions been widespread
as I said job on a billion devices and

171
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:33,600
16.4 million Americans are currently
enrolled in Obamacare so

172
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,959
from the previous slides my ad at the
top the truth will set you free so

173
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:47,480
trivia question number three which WWE
Superstar uses the catch phrase the

174
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,240
truth will set you free

175
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:16,830
worry that happens to be my sister had
to put it in the dark so the next one

176
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,870
where did this go wrong

177
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:29,899
how can you be human nature before I go
to this next slide I'm gonna say that I

178
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:37,610
am currently a Certified ScrumMaster
planning on runing next month so when I

179
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:48,520
say it is it from experience as we're
going through the nineties when I was

180
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,690
first starting to become a professional
programmer me a development

181
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,230
methodologies came together we'll talk
about some of those in a little bit as

182
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:04,240
we crossed over into the new millennium
the actual manifesto laid out an ideal

183
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,460
environment for for doing programming as
far as the developers were concerned

184
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:17,549
over a dozen different methodologies
have been published as i said im a

185
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,530
Certified ScrumMaster

186
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,700
lots of certifications out there
available like their certifications

187
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:32,590
insecurity this idea of agile
development redefine relationship

188
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,870
between project managers stakeholders
and developers and it gave the

189
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,560
development team more control over the
development of the software talk about

190
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,800
it that's good or bad in a few minutes I
want to compare that to the new near

191
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,980
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was created to
combat the Great Depression in 1933 and

192
00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:03,180
that was well before I was born before
you say unemployment increased 25% at

193
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:08,560
that point they created fourteen
programs over a four-year period with

194
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,230
far-reaching effects that included
subsidizing farmers created a national

195
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:19,110
retirement fund also known as Social
Security unemployment insurance and it

196
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:25,179
actually increase the power of unions
and I'll talk about that in a second so

197
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:32,530
trivia question number for him to a duel
development methodologies represented in

198
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:43,700
the agile Alliance which is when the
actual manifesto was created as one

199
00:21:43,700 --> 00:22:00,779
computers so if you wanted to know the
whole list had extreme programming from

200
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:09,610
the SDM adaptive software development
crystal feature Dave driven development

201
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:15,350
pragmatic programming all came together
at this conference that lasted three

202
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,658
days and they came up with that
manifesto and again it was a group of

203
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:25,269
strictly developers and philosophers
there wasn't a whole lot of interaction

204
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:36,820
from other groups and it really did
change the development world the world

205
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:50,220
will never end to quote ever be the same
again it was all focused around

206
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,860
developers it really was it promises
paste reliable software development no

207
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,449
more spending 72 hours at the office

208
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,240
straight tryna get a release out the
door because it has to go out on

209
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:12,090
September 30 is no more a management
philosophy that I'm very familiar with

210
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,820
but not a fire burning and turn them you
just run a developer's as hard as you

211
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:25,460
can when they burn out to go somewhere
else you hire new ones and other

212
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,740
promises a development was to remove
some of the overhead from traditional

213
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:36,419
project management but what really
happened as you ended up replacing their

214
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:40,500
overhead from the project management
with layers and layers of reworking

215
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:49,740
technical debt and then to quote a
former president said he changed the

216
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,659
third world here

217
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:58,470
what is done the definition of done is
the most struggling troublesome part of

218
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,359
a development for those of you who've
been around it

219
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,809
developing software is done when he can
compile it on his machine I've been

220
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:13,918
there if you ask someone who actually
has to use it it's when it works and it

221
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,460
does a lot of my machine every five
minutes and it's completely different if

222
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,269
you ask a security professional done is
when it works it doesn't like my machine

223
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:32,269
up every five minutes and Evan can hack
into an apartment it's so again if we

224
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:36,830
compare that to the New Deal the New
Deal completely changed the role of the

225
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:42,109
federal government and individualize
during the Great Depression president

226
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:49,080
hoover had encouraged America to stand
pat state hall and be patient

227
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,619
rely on yourself the addition of the new
deal

228
00:24:54,619 --> 00:25:01,399
the federal government assumed
responsibility for taking care of

229
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:14,830
individual people so that was a huge
game changer in the United States also

230
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,210
as a side note

231
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:23,310
social security and unemployment
insurance added a new revenue stream

232
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:35,040
that Congress could borrow money from
since 1934 United's 16% of the United

233
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,149
States national debt is money that they
have borrowed from Social Security so

234
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,500
they took a piece of paper and said we
are social security this many dollars

235
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,300
they were going to have to pay to people
over time they stick it in a drawer they

236
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,470
took that money and spend it on
something whether it was built in

237
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:58,570
warships investigating outerspace
building power plants whatever they used

238
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:03,370
it for the money is now gone and back
into social security and if you and it's

239
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:11,389
a multi-trillion dollar deficit right
now so that's a lot of money and then

240
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:18,920
the most conflicting part of Angela's
what is done the most conflicting part

241
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,310
of the new deal is what's your
motivation to stop taking these benefits

242
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:31,210
what you start getting a simple answer
there's not one and until that enigma

243
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,980
has been solved

244
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:42,610
there's gonna be issues

245
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:49,280
question under fire just kidding the
real one which Chris Jericho is more

246
00:26:49,280 --> 00:27:20,950
kissable eighties hair jericho or the
short hair jericho nobody wants to

247
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,590
borrow I'm not gonna throw it all
depends on the stage

248
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:40,040
whoever wants it so let's summarize what
I've talked about here again

249
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,389
actual development was created with good
intentions but it was also created

250
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:49,320
within a very narrow focus the focus was
to give the developers what they wanted

251
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:57,580
to do there was no consideration for
deadlines there was no consideration for

252
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:09,629
project management there was very little
consideration for business it was touted

253
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,280
as to remove the heavy bonds put on
developers by traditional project

254
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,370
management such as waterfall for those
of you who are familiar with waterfall

255
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:23,360
take a moment here and talk about it so
the idea with waterfall is you you go

256
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,070
out you gather all your requirements you
figure out what your gonna build you sit

257
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,030
down and then you build it and nothing
changes your requirements are what they

258
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:39,710
are they stay static until you complete
it and then after you get to one auto

259
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:45,980
release then you go out and gather some
more requirements any changes that you

260
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,260
want to make anything that changed
during the development life cycle

261
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,640
and then you take all those and you
start all over again and it just

262
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:03,260
cascades from revision 1 2011 2012 and
that has been touted by scrum and other

263
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,129
methodologies as it simply takes too
long by the time you get all your

264
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,260
requirements gather all the requirements
that you gathered before I've already

265
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,220
changed and by the time you get it built
its changed again so they go through an

266
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,900
iterative process get the important
information and then get details about a

267
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,870
small piece of it

268
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:28,949
bill that small piece and then
re-evaluate its a great idea when it's

269
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:39,560
executed properly but unfortunately it's
not being executed very well in all the

270
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:45,010
end of the environment and I've been in
so far I've seen it in the federal

271
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:51,070
government have seen it in three
different commercial companies have

272
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:57,540
consulted with developers on two
different continents Europe and North

273
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:05,860
America in every situation it it's just
not being done real well they've they've

274
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:13,049
given me the keys to the prisoners

275
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:18,049
prisoners are running the prisoners are
running the prison at this point so it's

276
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:27,629
there's a long way to go and in just a
moment I'll talk about why but the new

277
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:33,019
deal it was created to bring the USL the
Great Depression it was marginally

278
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:39,480
successful if you if you go back and you
stay closely what really brought the

279
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,789
United States out of the Great
Depression was the bombing of Pearl

280
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:46,929
Harbor because then we actually had a
reason to go for a ton of money into

281
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:57,789
building warships building planes
building ammunition gearing up i mean to

282
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:03,929
go to go fight a fight it's debatable
whether we would have been dragged into

283
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:15,059
a not so go down to the to the next two
points down there the the New Deal rely

284
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:20,590
on the fact that people want to work and
improve if we had stuck with what

285
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:27,689
president president hoover had suggested
got re-elected there would be no

286
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,029
unemployment insurance or pay no Social
Security if you didn't take care of

287
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:39,100
yourself nobody would take care of you
which is how this country started once

288
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:46,629
the new deal with people started being
strongly will take care of themselves

289
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:53,189
this community I would say is an
exception but for the most part when you

290
00:31:53,190 --> 00:32:00,440
go out on the street and 100 people
there's probably one who's motivated as

291
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,900
the people in this room

292
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:10,850
and that leaves the problem goes back to
what I what I had before

293
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:15,770
what is the motivation to start taking
it once you start taking it we don't

294
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:25,220
have any gradual development be
successful the entirety and you got to

295
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,300
redefine what it seemed years and had
all they want multifunctional an entire

296
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,790
team who can build a project all working
together so your testers your security

297
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:40,570
people the developers the product owner
they all need to work as one and they

298
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:46,030
need to have a goal and after be
motivated to do it one of the biggest

299
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:53,040
problems in a development is now the
developers have complete control and

300
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,379
there is no repercussions for a fact
that they miss a deadline they yank 50

301
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:05,150
features out of a bill that were
promised so without solid controls from

302
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,460
the beginning

303
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:14,250
both can cost much more than predicted
and speaking of karst sixth and final

304
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:25,020
trivia question which is worth not one
but two bars what percentage of people

305
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,830
in the United States received some sort
of welfare benefits in 2014 and well

306
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:37,580
rounded to the nearest five so if you
get within 5 I'll give it to you within

307
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:47,929
the hour for CNN fortunately for you are
within percent so here's just a shade

308
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:54,200
over 35% 35.4% of the people in this
country received some sort of welfare

309
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,170
benefits in 2014

310
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:11,389
all of them so what I did not preserve
security in there because social

311
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:18,250
security is something that whether you
like it or not a person your check your

312
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:23,139
own it is is pulled out a form you have
from your employer a percentage or

313
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:29,639
self-employed and you have to pay it if
you don't go to jail to make your money

314
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:41,918
so that's a huge number to think that in
sixty years almost 70 years from the

315
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,790
program's not existing said more than
one-third of the people in this country

316
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:52,409
being honest kind of benefits is
shocking and if you look across the

317
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:59,710
industry every shop says they're
ditching waterfall their ditchin PMR

318
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:07,500
been close to getting my PMI
certification at one point in my career

319
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:20,700
I must sadly admit their change into
actual but they're not getting controls

320
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:26,960
over it and without that you have to
have a really really focused really

321
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,270
really motivated team which is hard to
get sometimes and a cohesive team to

322
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:40,480
work together it's not going to work for
you so I had

323
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,160
I have hopes that these things will
change but promises in the near future

324
00:35:46,160 --> 00:36:25,970
so that I will open up to see if there's
any questions

325
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:39,098
entire talk if I was talking at JavaOne
or and i dont methodology course I could

326
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:48,690
literally spend hours on this so what I
get peace parties so controlling your

327
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:55,920
build really starts with building a good
track record with your product

328
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,170
stakeholders if you deliver what you're
gonna say you're gonna deliver to your

329
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:08,080
stakeholders on a regular basis they're
not gonna mess with your schedule unless

330
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,009
they absolutely have to if you can come
out day one and say I'm going to deliver

331
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,590
this piece of software and it's going to
work and I'm not deliver another piece

332
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:23,260
of the software is going to work and you
do it time after time after time they're

333
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:30,580
gonna know that at the end of that cycle
whether it's waterfall or Advil that

334
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,279
they can make their adjustments and then
wait one more cycle and it'll be there

335
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:41,270
if you consistently miss your deadlines
then they're gonna consistently mass

336
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:48,330
with your schedule more often it's just
like when you're dealing with a teenager

337
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:55,910
have two of them at home if they're
consistently late to school

338
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,450
gonna make him get up or change your
schedule you gonna make me go to bed

339
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:04,580
earlier Mr consistently late turning in
the homework you're going to want to

340
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,730
check their homework every day at 8:30
p.m. and I've done this from time to

341
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:19,690
time so the the way to keep your
stakeholders out of your hair is to

342
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,040
deliver what you say you're going to
deliver even if it's not what they're

343
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,349
asking for at that moment they'll
understand they can come back and get

344
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:32,280
another iteration definition of done

345
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:41,050
that has to star at an organizational
level the software will work it will not

346
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:47,670
be bloated it will not require 17 cores
and a laptop for it actually run worth

347
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:55,730
anything it will have documentation
something that I've had to get over

348
00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:02,860
multiple times with multiple grades
putting security and in day one when you

349
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:09,960
first start looking at the arc
architecture secures well have an

350
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:21,250
architecture that's a start to Java
secure program which I have to renew

351
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:27,950
next summer here and here to somebody
who's sitting in the next to last row

352
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:41,250
the idea is make done actually done that
doesn't mean it to develop cracks is

353
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,250
tired of coating it or they actually got
it to build for the first time

354
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:54,730
done really has to be something usable
one of the best analogies and talked

355
00:39:54,730 --> 00:40:04,160
about other talks no indifference
savings is that mechanic working on a

356
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:13,660
car because you have your cars that go
over there is no tires on it is not done

357
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:19,680
yet you finished fixing the carburetor
fuel injectors or whatever but I can't

358
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,440
drive it because you back later and says
it's done

359
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,819
and there's no battery in it I gotta go
back home to give battery delivered

360
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:40,319
putting in all along the way they had to
change the ignition switch so the next

361
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:53,079
time I go back my keys dollar so really
need to set out a very simple but direct

362
00:40:53,079 --> 00:41:00,640
way of saying for my software to be done
it must compile it must execute as the

363
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,799
violent defined in the functional specs
it must have documentation that a fourth

364
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,190
grader can understand just javadoc down
out of what's in the code is not

365
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:18,790
sufficient to give the User end-users
security architect must look at it

366
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:27,400
given it wants over at one point in my
career I spent over two years fifty

367
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,520
developers they were working on various
websites for a major health insurance

368
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,859
company in the southeast

369
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:40,400
none of their code which production if
myself or my partner didn't look at it

370
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:48,339
nothing we were looking for a resource
league's looking for security issues we

371
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:54,380
were looking for plaintext passwords in
in the configuration files which is

372
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:05,400
maddening that I still see that in 2015
you lay out the simple things and say it

373
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,369
will not be considered down until it
meets these eight criteria whatever it

374
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:16,050
takes then you hold him to it and if the
team works together steps up and

375
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:21,940
delivers time after time you know you
better

376
00:42:21,940 --> 00:44:42,520
was one more piece of your question

377
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:58,310
there were no boundaries set on it we
were the plan was the dump a bunch of

378
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:04,529
money into the economy and watch what
happens there are no limitations set on

379
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:36,990
it there were no

380
00:45:36,990 --> 00:46:17,529
ok

381
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:24,920
afterwards which is the same thing is
trying to put security and afterwards

382
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:37,470
when an application is bill it doesn't
work it just doesn't work the the idea

383
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:46,819
behind what was being done was good but
it also rely on some ideals that it

384
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,620
changed in this country

385
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:55,480
rely on the fact that that nobody wanted
to stay on welfare for three generations

386
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:05,390
which happens in this country it relies
on the fact that people wanted to make a

387
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:12,529
difference and the same thing with a
development it relies on the fact that

388
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:17,340
you have a maturity when they commit to
doing something even if they have to

389
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:25,430
miss Monday Night Raw a couple of times
when you stay and work late coating will

390
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:31,870
get it down and there is a portion of
our community and there's a portion of

391
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:40,880
this country that does that support in
the Dozen and that's the hard part

392
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,359
I'm not saying you're out of it I'm just
saying they changed the way people think

393
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:54,410
about it if you look back at software
development in the early nineties when I

394
00:47:54,410 --> 00:48:01,339
started coding you were given a hard
salary requirements and you had to meet

395
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:08,799
him now the development team is
developing on nineteen different

396
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:12,609
languages if they feel like it would
otherwise the half-year the day

397
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:22,660
especially the way however you want to
phrase it and they define what goes to

398
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:38,670
the user so much more so than they did
20 years ago along the same way that

399
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:45,150
that the New Deal changed our view of
the federal government if you look at

400
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:49,309
the federal government a hundred years
ago the federal government was there to

401
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:56,799
give you the opportunity to make the
best you could and then the New Deal

402
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:01,250
change their views to the federal
government there is to catch you if you

403
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:07,369
can't do that what you expected to you
and in the years since the new deal

404
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:12,750
reviewers become it's the government's
responsibility to take care of me and

405
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:18,720
that's a problem and unfortunately I see
some of the changes in the software

406
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:28,959
development community going to very
similar out twenty years ago you had to

407
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,119
meet the requirements and i know im
running short on time

408
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:48,769
as it's going now it's tell you what you
need and how you need it and then being

409
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:55,689
the developers and then at some point I
think it could change to the point where

410
00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:03,019
they expect that whatever they deliver
will be accepted

411
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:15,419
we do know this word Microsoft whatever
they throw at you they expect you to

412
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:41,539
spend the money on a very always have
been whether its burgers steaks or my

413
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:51,819
software development it's gotta be well
done just a quick list of references

414
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:55,569
these are all the different sites that's
a good look at to gather information

415
00:50:55,569 --> 00:51:04,829
they'll be on the slides are you posted
to the website and enclosing a quick

416
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:10,140
thank you obviously thank yous got
caught up on forgiving me my first

417
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:19,420
opportunity to speak at a con thanks to
Pinterest fail for writing back into I

418
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,450
actually got to stop down and
encouraging me to talk

419
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:28,379
and thank you for giving me the
opportunity to fly here instead of

420
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,640
driving to my house

421
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:39,210
much better handle that there will be on
the website thank you please go have a

422
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,590
drink and found something much more
chipper their mother
