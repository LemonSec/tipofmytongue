1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,660
some Scott Fitzpatrick

2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,830
forward medicine I was here last year
and bored most people to tears with my

3
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,020
talk of herbal medicines and plan on
doing the same thing again today we're

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,689
going to do more and get away from the
herbs today and do a lot more with pain

5
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,850
and interestingly one of the guys are
really throughout the whole way has

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,769
something we're going to describe and
discuss here as we go through so at any

7
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:45,070
point I'm stop me none of this is
anything we can get back to immediately

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,800
so if you have questions if you have
questions that you don't want to ask in

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,230
front of people I have emailed you can
stop in later it's ok to try to catch me

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,319
before I have too many scotches upstairs
and I might be able to answer a question

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,789
or two so here we go

12
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,660
programmers players in pain and we'll
talk about so many creative ways to

13
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,030
approach your health and particularly
overuse syndromes which is what a lot of

14
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,039
us have spent too much time on computers
so approach to health is health care as

15
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:21,090
if you were writing code in london of
course I go back to self I say this

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,259
approach to health care as if you're
writing code because you just like

17
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,099
writing code if you do one thing and you
expect such an outcome that's what

18
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:32,399
you're going to get to try to to to to
set your health care like you writing

19
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,530
code is is vital because you've got to
create a great foundation great health

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,270
doesn't just magically appear so here we
go

21
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,759
common pain overuse syndromes a couple
things that we've all had our most of us

22
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,239
have had and continue to have regularly
lower back pain neck and shoulder pain

23
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:56,759
and re-used finger pain headaches nice
train so first really important side

24
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,209
prevention and treatment the number one
thing that you want to do is not see a

25
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,520
doctor you want to prevent healthy wanna
stay as healthy as you can be because

26
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,848
the closer you get to going in hospitals
and longer and hospitals the the the the

27
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:14,459
more risk there is going to be regarding
health so prevention is your

28
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,709
responsibility can take an active
approach your health by staying by

29
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:23,330
paying attention to your body stretching
stress man injured medic meditation

30
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,460
exercise and diet have all been proven
to keep people healthy and out of

31
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,620
doctors offices human nature is to avoid

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:41,180
pain that's why they invented divorces
thanks very much so and I'll take and

33
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,030
i've lived as and believed in this for
many many years and old sage wants that

34
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,569
you're only as old you're only as young
as the flexibility for spine and we

35
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:56,920
discuss this early and I should have put
brain as well because oldest people

36
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,238
you'll ever see the stiffest people
you'll see a young person with the

37
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,359
really stiff back and really stiff spine
they just look old they don't move will

38
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:08,810
there's not a lot of flow and that
translates directly to the skull into

39
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,090
the brain

40
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,209
there's this whole serious the
cerebrospinal fluid movement from your

41
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,670
brain and spinal back and forth the
osteopath talk about it for for for many

42
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,429
many years and that's the fluid that
lubricates your brain lubricate your

43
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:27,359
spine is vital that moves regularly in
in in a very fluid fashion so if you're

44
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:31,690
not pretty active you're not moving
around not being fluid your brain's not

45
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,480
fluent in for those of you in this room
that fluid he is vital

46
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,950
everybody in here is really smart that's
important that you keep your body as

47
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,319
healthy as your brain so treatments
treatments for a minute treatment for

48
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,888
treatments for pain syndromes are very
complicated and involve many moving

49
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:55,000
parts your best bet is to avoid injury
in and of course it avoid doctors you

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,660
need to have a knowledgeable primary
kill her primary care provider that

51
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,470
knows all of the treatment modalities
and will help you find the most

52
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,019
appropriate path now that can be
positions physician's assistants that

53
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,940
can be yoga masters that can be your
your physical therapist your your next

54
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,440
door neighbor whoever it is it doesn't
matter if they're knowledgeable and if

55
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,858
they understand the system you do not
have to have an empty behind your name

56
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:26,310
to know healthcare can come in many
different forms so but you have to know

57
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,550
the path ok so dropping down where you
can't hardly see this thing in the red

58
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,470
which I wish I would have written things
that read no medicinal therapeutic and

59
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,360
interventional treatments are all
necessary and should be used when

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,020
appropriate

61
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,030
there's a time and place for every
Monday Lt

62
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,830
this is a very difficult path to
negotiate and should be don't take care

63
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,469
now I'm not gonna ask you to raise your
hands but everyone in here probably

64
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,069
assume that doctor some point I'm but
how many people in the arab emirate and

65
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:02,800
yoga you know some people enjoy over how
many have ever had to go through an

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,020
exercise class or work out how many
people in this room actually exercised

67
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,280
regularly you know ok so we got some
good young people ask me if I exercise

68
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,840
and I say hell no one on exercises help
people get hurt and that's how I make

69
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,710
all my money but but i just kidding of
course I encourage exercise and I do

70
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:26,489
exercise a little doesn't look like I
don't know but it's it is important that

71
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,800
we all do exercise to a certain degree
and we'll talk about some exercise that

72
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,180
are really really good that the one
thing I want to give you you guys today

73
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,900
is just a real brief overview of some of
these some of these things that you

74
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,419
suffer from because you know one thing
that we encounter and medicines lot of

75
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,440
people don't know who to talk to when
something is broken then we're going to

76
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,719
try to go through there really quick in
in that way and military really fast

77
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:52,440
try to get through this if you guys do
you have any questions you have ample

78
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,909
time at the end so I number one reason
for doctors visits lower back pain so

79
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:01,630
we'll introduce hierarchy these little
bit and give you the yellow yellow is

80
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,529
just an indicator that if you if you're
still on this area here you got a

81
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:09,479
fighting chance to get better quickly
you wake up in the morning back stiff

82
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,349
and sore is usually a so you know you
start thinking about poor policy is to

83
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:18,270
think about arthritis is improper
workstation ergonomics your bed

84
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:25,029
stiffness pillows and of course lack of
movement and physical activity now this

85
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:28,659
is a broad pain it's really difficult
since when somebody comes in having back

86
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:32,000
pain but they can't really focus on how
much it hurts here we typically

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,120
associated with the very benign are kind
of a very kind of brought term called

88
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,560
lumbago sis lower back pain when it
moves to the next step we told us

89
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,569
peasants in 10 Spain's movement we talk
about muscle cramps spasms around nerves

90
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,370
limiting movement very localized and
berries isolates 10 where somebody comes

91
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,110
in with a sore back are sore shoulder

92
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,920
you can push into a certain very certain
space in it and you can really kind of

93
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,970
isolated specific muscle that specific
nerve the specific read that out of

94
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,220
place makes it a lot easier we started
talking about Limburg with muscle spasm

95
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,510
scientism piriformis syndrome snow again
this is just a really brief introduction

96
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,010
is only about 10,000 more things it
could be but these are some of the most

97
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,820
common things to hear of and that you'll
suffer from against spending a lot of

98
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,020
time on computers and then finally when
we're gonna get down to the bottom has

99
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,990
read that you can't see very well as
sharp shooting pain that's when we start

100
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,300
talking about possible disc involvements
we start we start time of radiculopathy

101
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,750
zand and pains to follow pathways now I
don't know how I managed to do this but

102
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,290
I blew that up just far enough where you
can read everything on the right hand

103
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:47,200
side of the screen so I apologise but in
a way these things these nerve pains

104
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,620
follow dermot on the pathways makes it a
lot easier for us to isolate and saying

105
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,620
okay if it's coming out this one's
particular space is probably associated

106
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,630
with this disk space for this this
intervertebral disk space and we can I

107
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,750
sleep things and do a better job of
figuring it out so you'll hear things

108
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,230
like neuropathies radiculopathy zoos are
just nerve pains are radiating sciatica

109
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,020
as you can tell us it joins physicians a
little joins in between the you know in

110
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,370
the spine nerves come out the gate
irritated together they get hot and i

111
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,720
got really angry just sometimes
herniated disc of all her party to the

112
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,130
bulging disk ok that's where you're
talking about this this is just a real

113
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,539
quick picture of a dormant for instance
the the young man I was talking to

114
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,640
earlier he had what gonna look like a
badass E eight C 78 radiculopathy is

115
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,909
giving us nerve pain shooting out and to
as you know fourth or fifth fingers when

116
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,949
you know it's kind of comes from the
lower cervical spine upper thoracic

117
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,810
spine yesterday as pain shooting down
the back of their leg you know it's

118
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:55,729
coming from certain lumbar spine nerves
and that's this is this this is greatly

119
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,300
limits most of you have seen as before
but that's how we know when you've

120
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,889
gotten to the point of something pretty
serious lol again

121
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:08,209
I got a nice lil MRI it's an enhanced
version here but you can see at the

122
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:12,809
bottom of the screen on the right hand
side I don't have a pointer

123
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:18,488
unfortunately but you can see very
clearly the lowest disc has pushed into

124
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:22,129
the spinal cord and that's gonna be
we're going to get to really severe

125
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:27,929
radiculopathy Xander opportunities and
sometimes a spinal stenosis which is a

126
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:35,189
narrowing of the canal something like
this looks on film to be probable

127
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:39,079
surgical case but sometimes we can treat
it with other things like stretching

128
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:46,160
like with traction ice anti-inflammatory
ease acupuncture epidurals and things of

129
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,839
that nature were gonna get into those in
just a minute in a real quick slide just

130
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,319
want to show you this is what happens
when you have these bulges in the disc

131
00:09:55,319 --> 00:10:00,209
the center of the little gelatinous part
inside the disc is kind of blue paying

132
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:06,138
out the edge the into the into the
nerves the nerve roots in this is when

133
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,850
you start really having some serious
issues up from left-to-right

134
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,480
top-to-bottom is obviously the more
severely get once you reach the lead

135
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,410
still the lower two levels you're
usually talking about visiting a

136
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,059
neurosurgeon or spine surgeon of some
sort until it gets to that point which

137
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,579
is what I want to preach to you got
we've we've got some pretty good options

138
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:27,669
so here are some of the options

139
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,959
movement only total movement just being
any kind of movement and toning muscle

140
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:36,079
tightness hamstrings are the number one
thing you got to learn how stretching

141
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,410
I'm gonna show you how to stretch your
hamstrings maybe in a minute

142
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,749
depend on how much time we have but when
you're at your computer desk if you'll

143
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:47,549
just sit and have your leg hiked up we
call my he'll hang with you sitting on

144
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,829
chair and then you put your leg onto
another chair is called healing is

145
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,929
really simple you can do this I do this
when I'm working on the computer it's a

146
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,689
great way to stricter and stricter
hamstring I'm also going to show you

147
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:03,799
never think it's a version of them some
of these yoga stretches ok as far as a

148
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:08,699
straight leg stretch twill slight twist
in my favorite is a pigeon pose here at

149
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:09,870
the NOC that

150
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,620
and you can all laugh at me and say it's
unfortunate for my lack of flexibility

151
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,990
movement on tight she danced anything's
better than nothing in so having a

152
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,460
structured rigorous exercise program is
not what everybody some people love it

153
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,000
some people don't but anything is better
than nothing and then finally movement

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,050
and tone the dead bugs a dominant
strengthen the emotion to do real quick

155
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:40,469
some some some abdominal strengthening
without having to do sit-ups I'm not a

156
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,920
huge fan of citizen on each Fanuc
crunches because if you have a lumbar

157
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,790
spine pain sometimes you can really
cause more back pain then you need to be

158
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,199
so we can do some things while we're
sitting at a computer disk without have

159
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,930
it to you know for those of us who are
really busy which most of you are able

160
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,219
to incorporate these into your normal
daily habits without having to take a

161
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,870
short time

162
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,540
layers of treatment lifestyle changes
Physiol Baltazar funky little brother

163
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,680
buzz you can sit on the make you tell
you how to Manila kind of weird but the

164
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,260
new ones have like backs on them and
they actually work really amazingly well

165
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,260
mixing that in with your normal couch or
sitting in the recliner is a great thing

166
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,380
when you are on a computer all night

167
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,700
medicines we have OTC medicines
anti-inflammatories herbal supplements

168
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,220
and prescription medications all have a
good place but you have to be careful

169
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,140
when you're taking any of these things
because many of these medications used

170
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,430
improperly or for too long a period of
time can cause a problem now there were

171
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,560
just talking about earlier today that
that the newest recommendations in pain

172
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,540
medications are that if you have your
prescription pain medication refilled

173
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,900
one time one time when you were
technically addicted to this so if you

174
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,730
have you fallen break an arm and you go
and you get your pain medicines and you

175
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,420
take your pain medicines and finish it
pain medicine but you have to go back

176
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,420
and get another prescription then
technically you are addicted to pain

177
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,229
pills and that's why this is such an
important thing prevention prevention

178
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,130
then

179
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,520
and learning other types of treatments
as I'm going down these layers of

180
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,910
treatments abcd were giving it to the
the lifestyle changes the physio about

181
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,870
these are things you can do on your own
to keep from getting further down the

182
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,150
list to further down the list that
worsened and course more traumatic more

183
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:33,090
time and more expensive it becomes
lifestyle changes very easy

184
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,190
better you know get moving when you get
down to the non-invasive therapies the

185
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,840
ice the heat ice is your best friend
when you have an injury and I tell

186
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,780
people if you have a lower back injury
don't ice for 20 minutes a nice for

187
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,880
hours but I saw your bed for hours let
it melt and put more ice just to keep

188
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,700
the swelling of physical therapy
osteopathic manipulation are wonderful

189
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,840
wonderful early interventions that can
help people fix pain fix their lifestyle

190
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,920
do some changes before you get these
things were you need invasive care when

191
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,660
you get in the invasive Karagounis the
acupuncture the trigger points of pain

192
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,810
special so do the epidurals deficit the
nerve ablation where they're actually

193
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,800
cauterize the nerve and then of course
surgery is kind of off the top of the

194
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,670
wrong we want to avoid getting too far
down them down the line so remember

195
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,990
prevention prevention is the number one
thing change these things are really

196
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:38,380
good lifestyle changes most important so
I'm gonna go do some neck and shoulder

197
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:45,340
stuff than most opera quick enjoy a
couple of stretches and we will continue

198
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,840
moving on because I think right now
we're we're doing ok tom eyes

199
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,240
ok good so we're rollin

200
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,800
neck and shoulder pain real quick stiff
and sore this is

201
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,760
the introductory kind of stiff and
soreness that we all tend to have you

202
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,920
have this tenderness achy feeling due to
fatigue and pain with movement feeling

203
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,729
the need for a massage just makes you
feel better and a change in the

204
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,910
workstation environment so and again
this is associated with and again I cut

205
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,560
it off when I went full screen here but
muscle fatigue and trigger points that's

206
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,229
when somebody can come up behind you and
stick their thumb on his shoulder

207
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,459
you know sore shoulder gets a trigger
point that's where we stick needles and

208
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:31,000
they say they feel good believe it or
not the second career start getting into

209
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,290
spasms and cramps you have really sore
spots it tender to the touch almost 2

210
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:41,349
tended to massage your range of motion
is starting to really get low because of

211
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,110
the pain and the information and now you
got a moving into your shoulder blade

212
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,829
and sometimes up into your job we call
rhomboid or pain peres scapular pain

213
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:56,420
which is just as the the shoulder blade
the TMJ will get a lot of people with

214
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,029
TMJ pain and I'll treat their neck and
upper shoulders because of the greeting

215
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,260
and in the grinding of her neck and
shoulders of the tension and then a

216
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:12,180
tendinitis and muscle spasms involved
with all this ok so the key is when

217
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,579
you're having these spasms in your
having these cramps has to intervene

218
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:20,920
here because the next thing becomes the
real problematic area the sharp shooting

219
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,260
pain this we have a true nerve
involvement are probable disc

220
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,880
involvement you start getting some
numbness you start getting some some

221
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,480
some sharp shooting pains so let's stop
for just a second you think going back

222
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,579
in and we discussed this earlier going
back to the Middle this despair as in

223
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:42,130
pain and cramps going into the job of
course a lot of people you'll hear you

224
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,399
associate that with cardiac disease and
and that's something that you need a

225
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,800
great primary care provider to go
through and make sure that you clear

226
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,209
that and it's not just a shoulder pain
and not just inner pane ok don't avoid

227
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:59,869
going to the doctors doctors aren't all
bad you know we just need to be used

228
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:06,169
judiciously somebody giving back to the
sharp shooting pain when you have a

229
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:08,220
numbness or tingling that

230
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,850
that is intense or you lose function
that is a really serious issue

231
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:16,469
numbness tingling a lot of times if
you'll take the swimming away

232
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,110
yuri incorporates some some movement it
take away the insult whatever that

233
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:26,319
insult is a lot of times it comes back
it takes time but now if if if people I

234
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,730
tell people you know one thing that if
you wake up in your having nerve pain in

235
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,419
this and you can't move it that's a
that's a surgical case and you need to

236
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:39,750
find a good neurosurgeon or again I get
spine Dr stenosis you're here again here

237
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,490
at the bottom right-hand side you hear a
lot of people here talking about the

238
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,600
spinal cord stenosis is typically a
little more common as we age there's an

239
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,330
earring in the canal you get some pain
shooting down both sides of the neck and

240
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,350
shoulders both sides of the legs
typically Wilson a lower back that's a

241
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,530
really tough thing to treat but you know
stretching eyes anti-inflammatory these

242
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,090
early on

243
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:09,330
hopefully you won't get to this point
hopefully real quick radicular are kind

244
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,360
of a Dermatol

245
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,658
that will use quite often I'm you can
see the branches these nerves coming

246
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:22,490
from the cervical spine the thoracic
spine and that just helps us ghost well

247
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,220
okay this is what you having to sit this
is probably what you've got it helps us

248
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,720
to isolate do needles do injections to
scans whatever it is

249
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:39,169
do manipulations do myofascial releases
etc and again stretching of the neck and

250
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:45,510
upper back and shoulder and yoga we call
this an open heart called threading the

251
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,590
needle there's a different incorporating
new twist and I'm gonna try to show you

252
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:55,860
these if I can get I will try to show
you some of these real quickly because

253
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,908
we do I think now we made up a little
bit of time so far back stretches rumble

254
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:06,190
strips of scapular sets these are things
that are vital that keep you out of the

255
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,450
doctors offices and keep you

256
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,440
banging out your work making people
happy making money whatever it is you

257
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,270
try and do and then see relaxation
techniques meditation yoga acupuncture

258
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:23,170
exercises these things are guaranteed
proven to keep people healthier that

259
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,800
doesn't mean you'll never get her but it
just hopefully keep you from being 22

260
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,919
injured now before the city's I want to
go to the next the next light or the

261
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,550
next part of this which is layers of
treatment

262
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,230
number one elbow support with bill is
people have never seen as you one thing

263
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,110
you hear about their economic survey of
a of a of a desk you'll hear well I have

264
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,169
a stand-up desk that's nice or I have a
mouse to you know the does flips and

265
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,740
multicolor have asked maybe have a
keyboard afloat in here you know all

266
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,750
these things whatever whatever it is
these things all are nice but one thing

267
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,460
it doesn't do is take the pain of the
neck and shoulders so what I like to

268
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,690
tell people

269
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:08,400
truck drivers computer people their own
computers all day every single day if

270
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,360
you think about it you doing this no
matter if you're standing or sitting

271
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,939
you're still doing this you know your
your shoulder is hearings are still

272
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:24,140
relate to people as you know what's your
name what's your name

273
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:31,130
correct so Sarah and I are gonna go out
here and Briley Parkway and we're gonna

274
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:36,020
walk for the next eight hours how are
your legs gonna fill it in the daytime

275
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:45,920
hours you may both we probably make at
least 20 or 30 minutes I would help

276
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,610
yes or pain hurt like shit pretty much
yeah well what do you think your neck

277
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,760
and shoulders feel like all day long you
think about this what you're doing you

278
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,370
keep your neck and shoulders took like
this all day long

279
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,409
that's why you have all that tension and
tightness so when I tell people all of

280
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,590
these other things are wonderful but if

remind you that you're doing something
for yourself now the dead bugs exhaling

326
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:32,130
demography again I don't love situps
especially some as back pain like hearts

327
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:47,560
misleading making stomach it yourself in
the stomach ok do that again until a

328
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,520
couple times but each time take your
arms and legs and two different planes

329
00:28:52,520 --> 00:29:01,590
to create this balance which comes from
the asymmetry you can do leg out ok you

330
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:10,580
know what every week since we need to do
make sure you keep tight asian and

331
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:18,320
shortness of breath which is perfect I
think it's all over now so there's my

332
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,659
exercise for the Desi I did something
constructive I that's no more on the

333
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,870
floor umpires alright question so far
back pain neck pain shoulder pain

334
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,570
stretches

335
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:38,129
ok ok so the hip pain was starting to
hit pain again the hip is a pretty

336
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,710
complicated joint but it's usually
responds to treatment really really

337
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,560
really well the first thing is hamstring
stretch to those Hampshire insurance

338
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,940
just he'll hang them on the second thing
I always tell people to do that pigeon

339
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,310
pose a land on that you can't do lay
down I'm gonna show you sitting version

340
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,010
of the sitting version is very similar
like if you're sitting on the couch if

341
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,610
you're sitting in a recliner and will
show you the perfect way to do it

342
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,370
because I do this a lot when I think
Linthicum working with people

343
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,270
they don't know but I'm actually
stretching while I'm interviewing them

344
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,300
what to do

345
00:30:08,300 --> 00:31:01,570
imagine if I have a recliner

346
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:32,169
different things for different kind of
sounds like him again if you if you can

347
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,950
email me and I'll be happy to send you
some others but rather pigeons my favor

348
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:41,260
alright good other questions neck
shoulder pain we talked about the neck

349
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:50,290
early rise stretching yoga is just one
of the best things ever you know as far

350
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:55,330
as keeping you out of doctors offices
and there's other types of exercise

351
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,429
there's there's a million just find
something that suits your you know your

352
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:13,490
style and that's that's all I would say
so let's see how much more wind alright

353
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,900
was gonna hand wrist and finger paint of
course hand and wrist thing you're

354
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:25,110
paying can is is kind of a weird thing
you know sometimes I really easy to just

355
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:32,719
taking away the insult in other words
it's not typing on a keyboard is tilted

356
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,390
away from you or tilted back too far you
like your risk to canobie in a neutral

357
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:41,600
position that tends to help bunch but
here's the thing just like anything else

358
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,969
Thomas tour sort of stiffness tingling
sometimes that resolves when you change

359
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,410
positions that's a good thing that's
when we really have to jump on a quickly

360
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:57,650
better with rest better with stretching
that those changes in positions as

361
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,390
typically overuse syndrome and of course
overuse syndromes come from any kind of

362
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:07,730
mechanical thing that you're doing way
too often the game system is a great

363
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,430
example of them

364
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,580
sharp pain associate with movement in
really does he doesn't get much better

365
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,530
you start thinking about some of the
more severe things like a carpal tunnel

366
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:23,580
syndrome sometimes a dick where band
syndrome trigger fingers lateral

367
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,590
epicondylitis is 10 adult tennis elbow
golfer's elbow things like that tend to

368
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:34,159
be a little bit different and certainly
disc herniation neck stenosis is an

369
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,480
annex unerring of the canal and some
bones and again these things come and go

370
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,410
sometimes are easily treated sometimes
there just a bare but the best thing you

371
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:48,060
can do is not get to that point so
preventing stretches you know tell

372
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,060
people we're sure it is one of my
favorite stretches for the wrist and

373
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,530
fingers you just put your hands in your
face and you keeping your palms together

374
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,300
you just go down the front of your chest
right up against your chest as far as

375
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:09,440
you can go comfortably and just let your
hands and fingers and wrist stretch then

376
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,550
you do the exact opposite way but your
your wrists together toward keeping a

377
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:21,200
right up against your chest against
great stretches for your wrist tight

378
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:27,109
zeroing just simple stuff you know you
see people doing that I T roles and it's

379
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,720
nothing more than you can call if you
want

380
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,659
thousand different ways depending on
what country you're from but they're all

381
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:41,940
just movement and be changing an angle
neutral again as the best you don't want

382
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,350
your fingers reaching too far down are
being it's too far back and of course

383
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,120
any kind of gaming appendages you have
to make sure that you have a right

384
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,040
position now

385
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,320
layers of treatment again he gotta
change the insulting even so what is

386
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,760
causing the issue if it's a joystick
whatever your joystick maybe make sure

387
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,710
that you make to use appropriate
joysticks

388
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:12,930
braces are great short-term medicines
are great short-term all these

389
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:16,830
interventions are short term but you
really need to make some changes because

390
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,580
you don't have to use these things for
too long

391
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,799
medicines OTC herbal supplements

392
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,570
a wonderful sup man I love is called
Curcuma her to market a natural

393
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:32,230
anti-inflammatory non-invasive therapies
ice again ice is your best friend when

394
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:38,670
you're introduced swelling you want to
stop the swelling you want to stop the

395
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:44,339
insults ok can do massage massages are
wonderful for things like this

396
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:48,490
osteopathic manipulation sometimes it
just takes it moving a boner wrist back

397
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,810
in place to to get better than we do we
start talking about other things I C and

398
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:58,410
using acupuncture lot of carpal tunnel
syndrome and it works really well but it

399
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,810
doesn't feel great so we like to get it
before it gets to that point and it's

400
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:07,750
not about percent the pain specialists
are great the new hand surgeons they've

401
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,240
got some new techniques for the carpal
tunnel release is which are super duper

402
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,709
effective in much less invasive than
they used to be

403
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:20,480
gotta find the best hands origins gotta
find people to a new techniques and the

404
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:29,630
need to really try not to get there if
at all possible ok I i strain is one of

405
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,089
those things we really don't pay enough
attention to my strengths can lead to a

406
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:40,349
lot of elements are you think about
evolution in a 3d world we see things in

407
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:45,680
three dimensions for the most part that
was why we grow hunter-gatherers

408
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,270
recognizing that you know Tiger running
after us whatever new computers make the

409
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,300
tough to do that the two-dimensional
world's make it tough to focus I see a

410
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,030
lot of kids now have have spent too much
time on computers have a lot more

411
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,609
difficult hitting baseballs shooting
basketball have a little bit more

412
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:07,250
trouble focusing using that buy an
ocular vision and and and and

413
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:12,550
judging distance it's a tracking
sometimes they just don't track as well

414
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:16,130
because they don't use it up in your
eyes are no different

415
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,430
the visual cortex in your brain is no
different than any other muscles of the

416
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:25,859
part of your brain if if it's not used
you lose it so it's really important

417
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:34,680
that you did you use your eyes and
exercise rise I guess is what I'm trying

418
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:42,440
to say and denies use consistent extra
effort to keep focused on screened RSI

419
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,660
of the eye muscles just like back and
neck and arms the same thing if you

420
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:53,720
don't use them you have these overuse
syndromes eyes no difference so I could

421
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,520
eyestrain and headaches in together

422
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,780
headaches are not always associate with
ice cream is really important that if

423
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:07,090
you have headaches for and again heading
to a whole nother topic that's a whole

424
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:11,210
years worth of topics and headaches but
the bottom line is you have eye strain

425
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:16,310
and some associated headaches muscle
pain blurry vision tries gritty feeling

426
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:20,630
changes in perception some things we can
do to treat those things we have trigger

427
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:25,980
points trigger point therapy is massages
things like that and they tend to get a

428
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,480
little bit better when you take your
break from computer headaches and my

429
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,550
practice in a lot of practice are one of
the most difficult things you can die or

430
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:41,510
have to diagnose because there are so
many moving parts of headaches one thing

431
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,570
always remember new changes new
headaches are changing headaches need to

432
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,700
be really kinda thoroughly evaluated as
you just never know but chronic tension

433
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,370
headaches sinus headaches eyestrain
headaches these things we can really

434
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,759
work on but you know we can go back to
the slide before that we're talking

435
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,850
about changes in lifestyle making some
making some positive changes what you do

436
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:10,080
consistent i-40 increase general fatigue
increases nearsightedness which is your

437
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,710
myopia and also postural changes so you
know a lot of us a possible change we

438
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:19,960
don't even realize it and and I think
sometimes it takes somebody looking

439
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,490
slapping your walking crooked whatever
it is because sometimes it we've been

440
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:29,419
doing it for a long time we just don't
realize it so trust whoever does to tell

441
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:35,820
you the the truth and they get you back
into line ok a couple things you can do

442
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,640
for this team for the nearsightedness
for possible changes you know find a

443
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,118
good optometrists find a good eye health
physical therapy is great massage

444
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:51,440
therapies great osteopathy wonderful
cause I can help you move things you

445
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,349
know acupuncture sometimes is pretty
good for so there's a lot of great

446
00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:00,859
things the next sentence here is really
an important sins thinking glasses like

447
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:04,220
shoes you know different types of lenses
do different things just like different

448
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:09,529
types of shoes flip flops sometimes you
need mother's glasses are no different

449
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:13,320
you know I'm wearing some designer
glasses you you can see that we picked

450
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,839
up the Dollar General Store for 99 cents
you know the plastic glass which is you

451
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,609
know works but that's not ideal and I
need to follow my own advice and

452
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:28,170
actually go get some proper glasses but
it is true

453
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,630
get some people that know what they're
talking about that you can trust him get

454
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,640
the proper lenses for what you do real
quickly as you can tell they

455
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,589
recommendations are as far as we can
tell white screens black letters seized

456
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:43,880
your very eyes to read they'll have to
work so hard

457
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,099
prevention real quickly prevention we
like to take breaks every two hours

458
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:55,280
reassessed posture remember to bring a
blank one thing I like to people's when

459
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,500
you're working on your computer is take
your eyes away and find a further this

460
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,580
point away in a room and typically a
corner into focus on a quiet cuz you

461
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,710
have two groups of my muscles in your in
your iris you know one kind of wraps

462
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,890
around like this and the other kind of
doing this right so what you want to do

463
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:17,140
is change those unless the the opposite
muscles to work it's the opposing muscle

464
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,640
theories he wants some to work while the
other ones wrist and back and forth

465
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:30,540
movement position milder high-level 18
20 inches away white screen was for the

466
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,450
anti static

467
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,580
six-year fix all of these things that
contrast to clear and decrease the blue

468
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,720
light because the blue lights are really
tough on your end over a long period of

469
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:46,270
time so real quickly incorporate these
things they will make you better

470
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,450
I'm regular visits we spent too much
time reading and occupiers protest just

471
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:54,180
what we do there's it's not like there's
a lot of options

472
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,970
proper . diet there's a lot of great
sports supplements out there for ocular

473
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:02,390
health great supplements acupuncture is
kind of an interesting thing there's

474
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,160
actually some acupuncture points
actually stimulate the visual cortex of

475
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,600
the brain that didn't do a whole lot
more guys but heavy rain it's your job

476
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,540
to work your eyes this twenty twenty 20
every 20 minutes

477
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,230
look at something twenty feet away for
20 seconds again that's the whole posing

478
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:25,130
muscle theory and to decrease
accommodated spasms you want to focus on

479
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:31,480
something again closed far away again
that's two decreases spasms in your eyes

480

RSI of eyestrain poor posture headaches

481
