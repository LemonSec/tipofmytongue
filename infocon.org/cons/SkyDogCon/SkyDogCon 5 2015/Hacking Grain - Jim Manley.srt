1
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:42,440
ok about 10 years organized SDC WTF we
done about 10 of now and like I

2
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,150
mentioned earlier I do work at a small
distillery in in in Fort Worth Texas so

3
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:54,589
so just a little bit of a disclaimer
there are exceptions everything about to

4
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,030
tell you okay so it's just that's just
the way it works if you have a question

5
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,170
rather than hold on to the end I don't
mind if you interrupt me and asked it

6
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,740
right right then and there I worked much
better in an interactive session and I

7
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,729
do just don't appear spilling stuff you
gotta ask a question that I may not

8
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,900
cover and so I'd rather give you the
information that you think you want to

9
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,350
have versus just me telling them done a
bunch of different things so I mentioned

10
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,158
besides Las Vegas 2011 where this kind
of got started I had showed up with the

11
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,610
artists in which is really kind of
spooky hotels you've never been there

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,590
before but I'd showed up with my magic
small bag appropriately loaded and we

13
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,130
were sitting out on the back porch at
the artisan with valujet I bunch of

14
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,070
people and I was Sharon step out of the
bag with them and talking with them

15
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,719
about all sorts of different things

16
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,369
production process and those types of
things and and fighting started getting

17
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,259
on my case about doing a talk of whiskey
talk right doing attack attack on and

18
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,039
you know other than the fact that we all
drink I really couldn't come up with a

19
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,929
good reason for why I would do you talk
attack on but then later on at several

20
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,460
of the DEFCON events have been out of
had several people who've been gone to

21
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,530
the BSD see WTF activities come up to me
and tell me that the stuff I learned

22
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:21,330
your talks has helped me in my business
in their business particularly the women

23
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,720
who attended the talks have been able to
now when I'm told me she's actually is

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,420
able to hold her own with guys and
whiskey discussions now because of the

25
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,019
stuff that she's learned in the classes
that i've done and I've actually use

26
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,300
this knowledge on some social
engineering engagements to so Evans said

27
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,420
hey you know you might want to come to
skype.com

28
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,179
just corky interested you could actually
do it talk there and it might actually

29
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,010
be appreciated so anyway Here I am so
whiskey within here whiskey without any

30
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,269
which is it right so this is kind of one
of the great debates and a lot of

31
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,140
different there is out there about why
it is the way it is the one that I find

32
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,149
to be probably the most credible is it
in the late 19th century John Jameson

33
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,130
John Powers and Georgia Rowe who are
already big Irish whiskey distillers in

34
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,420
their own right we're trying to figure
out a way to differentiate their their

35
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,649
swill their whiskey from this will it
was coming from across the Irish Sea

36
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,080
Scotland at the time and so they opted
to say well you know we're just gonna

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:25,140
change the spelling wanna add the e to
whiskey and so at this point in the UK

38
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,190
EU and rest of world there is no e in
the world

39
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,310
inward whiskey however in Ireland and in
the us- we do use the email that in the

40
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,660
USA we use the e primarily because a lot
of this region came over into the United

41
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:47,410
States at the time were however not
universal one of the largest with key

42
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,390
makers in the united states does not put
any and whiskey makers mark Chris a

43
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,470
tribute to their Scottish heritage so
they're doing it that way so classes are

44
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,670
spirits are six classes a spirit you got
your genes which are essentially neutral

45
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,649
grain spirits with aromatics added to
them you have August which are basically

46
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,090
just nutrigrain spirit made a pretty
much anything you can ferment potatoes

47
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:16,019
cabbage corn russians are very inventive
very desperate one of the two not sure

48
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,260
which there are rooms which are
essentially distill molasses and

49
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,289
tequilas which is blue agave and still
blue agave from the Alaska region down

50
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:31,860
in Mexico and brandies still grapes and
then you have my favorite of all whiskey

51
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:39,460
so what is with everybody knows whiskey
sunshine held together by water not

52
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,440
really is basically anything it's a it's
a distilled spirit distilled from Ash of

53
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,260
cereal grains that's the general big
broad definition more precisely in the

54
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,000
you s

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,730
that's the actual definition not gonna
retail but key things are has been less

56
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,770
190 proof as to possess the irritation a
Roman characteristics generally

57
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,840
attributed to whiskey circular
definition stored in containers except

58
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,580
for corn whiskey which doesn't have to
be story that way and and bada less than

59
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,520
80 proof so bourbon

60
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,870
this is referred to as as America's
native spirit is actually enjoyed

61
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,830
international protection in the fact
that bourbon can only be produced in the

62
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:35,530
United States ok now big miss air duster
you don't have to distill bourbon

63
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,739
Kentucky doesn't have to come from
Bourbon County in fact there are no

64
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,220
distilleries in Birmingham urban
counties a dry County yeah urban

65
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:55,550
counties in Bergen County okay that's
news yet I hadn't heard that but yeah a

66
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,810
dry County can't can't distribute cancer
right so bourbon has a very specific

67
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,370
definition biggest item being that is as
a minimum of 51% corn in the match bill

68
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:13,070
will consist of three grains corn flavor
in Greenwich leader be rider wheat and

69
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:22,200
then so between percent corn has to be
stored for a period of time in a new

70
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,870
charred american apparel there is no age
requirement for bourbon people at the

71
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,400
distillery I could take go over to the
receiver I could pull bourbon pull the

72
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,010
new makes ferret out of the receiver
dumped in a barrel swishing around put

73
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:42,810
it in a bottle and thats berman may not
even be aware drink in pain but that's

74
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,669
about it so and also has a bottle at a
minimum of maybe forty percent alcohol

75
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:54,310
by volume or any proof Tennessee Whiskey
Tennessee whiskey is essentially bourbon

76
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,020
ok same same style same match bill in
2013 the Tennessee State Legislature

77
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,200
came up with the designation says if you
wanna write Tennessee whiskey

78
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,430
on the bottle you have to go through
what is known as the Lincoln County

79
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,070
process in the Lincoln County process is
nothing more than taking the New Mex

80
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,880
Barrett comes up to still filtering it
through a charcoal filter before you put

81
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,810
it in the before you the Lincoln County
process was actually developed by Jack

82
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,490
Daniels distillery when when the story
was located in Lincoln County up there

83
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:31,360
are no disorders in Lincoln County now
Jack Aniston movie just move the county

84
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:46,320
around around it so actually for ya so
there are right right wheat and corn

85
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,349
whiskey they all follow the same basic
definitions bourbon the great content

86
00:07:52,350 --> 00:08:00,870
with evergreen that happens to be has to
be at least 51% and there's no story

87
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,760
straight out of the receiver go right
straight into the bottling tank and and

88
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:14,849
be modeled as it is a Canadian whiskies
from our cousins of North are typically

89
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,110
a blended multi grain whisky has a
really high court content that makes it

90
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:24,820
real light in spirit and flavor early on
the Canadiens figured out that if a ride

91
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,610
into the into the mash it would actually
make it very tasty whiskey and at that

92
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,159
point I'm and says back in the 1800's
the Canadian started referring to

93
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,978
whiskey is just right whiskey so it can
be confusing as to whether it's a big

94
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,250
briar Lowri in Canada today

95
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,560
you go to Canada and ask for rye whiskey
you'll get Canadian whiskey they don't

96
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,329
differentiate between the two as far as
this definition is pretty much like the

97
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,760
rest of them has to be done and can be
made in Canada there's

98
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,930
it does have a three-year age
requirement on his page for at least

99
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,979
three years doesn't have to be new wood
can be used barrels they can add caramel

100
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,850
coloring to that and I'll it at least
eight improve the production process for

101
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,360
us as well in the US will match all the
grains together

102
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,709
and then from instill that in Canada
that match the Greens separately

103
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,880
distill them separately bottle or age
them separately and then it's not until

104
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,829
they come they actually makes a separate
trains together in bottle add if they

105
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:34,199
feel like it gives a much more control
over the flavor profile there is an

106
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,829
interesting thing called a 9.09% role
with respect to whiskey that comes from

107
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,359
Canada into the United States that's
basically that we can have up to 9%

108
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,160
other components and it doesn't have to
be a hundred percent Canadian whiskey

109
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,189
there is no standards because it the
United States actually gives Canada

110
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,760
break on terrorists if they incorporate
some amount of american products into a

111
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,060
Canadian product so that the Canadians
do is go out and buy bourbon from from

112
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,319
the USA and then they'll dump some
amount of bourbon into their Canadian

113
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,570
whiskey so that they can claim this
taxes and Sandy when they when they sell

114
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:20,199
it to the us- discuss him to basic
styles there's a malt whisky which is

115
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:23,560
essentially a hundred percent malted
barley and then blended whiskey which is

116
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,660
a blend of malted barley and malt
whiskies grain whiskies now you see the

117
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,709
term single single malt whisky this is a
100%

118
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:40,729
the fact that is one distillery has
nothing to do with the fact that sounded

119
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,100
percent malta has to do all this comes
from a single distillery grain whiskies

120
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,350
are the same way grain whisky can be any
grain typically anywhere from 60 to 80

121
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,980
percent of the Enneagram + 20 to 40%
malted barley again all coming from a

122
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,269
single distillery and they have a
blended malt whisky this was a

123
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:06,709
traditional style with Scotland until
the early nineteen hundred and this was

124
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:11,310
a city where you take the blender with
take whiskeys it came from a single malt

125
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,920
whiskies come from several different
stories and blend them all together and

126
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,519
then that was what they would bottle be
so maybe a blend of several different

127
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,510
malt whiskies now it today is blended
Scotch whisky this is the predominant

128
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,490
whiskey on the market if you buy
Scottsdale

129
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:40,709
be blended Scotch anywhere from 90 to
95% the market today is so very

130
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:45,149
particular definition again producing
matured 100% in Scotland can consist of

131
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:51,060
only three radiance water malted barley
and yeast after be still less than

132
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,489
ninety four point eight percent alcohol
by volume you see 94.8% alcohol by

133
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:03,200
volume and lot of definitions and
there's a reason for that that that

134
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,709
strength you actually have to go into
back you still cannot get above 94

135
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:13,800
percent alcohol by volume in an open-air
non pressurised still so that's why you

136
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,589
see a matured in oak cask again not not
Scotch is not required new oak going to

137
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,550
use barrels in fact most of the bourbon
barrels that are used and dumped in the

138
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,709
United States end up going to Scotland
because of rain barrel can only be used

139
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:34,880
once to produce bourbon barrels will end
up going to the you going over to to the

140
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,860
to the UK in their broken down and
rebuilt into a little bit larger size

141
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,589
barrel and used for storing a scotch
whiskey no added substances other than

142
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:48,329
water and caramel coloring and again

143
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:54,579
filed an illicit 40% ABV I said Irish
whiskeys again pretty much the same

144
00:12:54,579 --> 00:13:00,209
definition has to be produced in Ireland
has to be staged at least three years

145
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:06,969
still the lesson 94.8% now in addition
test single malt whiskies

146
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,600
and blended malt whiskies in Irish
whiskeys the Irish have a very unique

147
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,040
style called a single pot still whiskey
and this originated in the 19th century

148
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,969
when the English started to tax the
Irish on the amount of malted barley

149
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:30,230
that was going into their whiskey so the
Irish in typical Irish style flip the

150
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,629
English the bird and started in changed
up their math skills instead of using a

151
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:37,509
hundred percent multi-party they started
mixing malted barley with unwanted

152
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:43,089
barley and resulted in a style still and
that's been probably one of the

153
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:48,310
predominant sellers today is a single
possible style whiskey

154
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,060
peculiar thing about Irish whiskey is
most Scotch whiskies are double

155
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,599
distilled so the run that these two
separate stills Irish whiskies are

156
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,740
actually triple distilled those who are
still three times in order to nest again

157
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,839
the ideas to create a very high alcohol
content which results in a much lighter

158
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:14,180
carrier whiskey moonshine china's one of
my pet peeves because the left the legal

159
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,500
definition of moonshine is is basically
any grain spirit in which the taxes have

160
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,959
not been paid

161
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,609
okay so it's untaxed which makes it
illegal

162
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:32,000
alright so this stuff that you see in
the store is not technically not

163
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,600
moonshine is just an age to please and
then aged corn-based spirit exactly now

164
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,819
I don't know how many of you know Chris
had to get human hacker ok Chris

165
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:48,360
moonshiners gotta be when his favorite
things so if you really want to get on

166
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,160
chris is good side getting a bottle of
moonshine

167
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,850
love you forever for after we get done
here I'll give you kisses

168
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:50,880
that picture not really now I did tell
him he was gonna he was gonna figure

169
00:15:50,880 --> 00:16:02,439
prominently in the TOC other types of
white whiskey which is essentially an

170
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,540
aged spirit has been deleted down and
bottle for sale and then there's these

171
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:13,779
things these flavored whiskeys yea this
needs these are abominations as far as

172
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:17,699
I'm concerned essentially a flavored
whiskey is a whiskey this after it's

173
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:26,899
been ages since used with some kind of
flavor whether that's funny or die's are

174
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:31,000
not not these are not get things as far
as I'm concerned then there's always

175
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,839
things that are not whiskey ok so
flavored moonshine is typically are not

176
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,389
considered risky because if you look at
the alcohol content on only run anywhere

177
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,569
from 20 to 30 percent alcohol by volume
so they don't actually meet the

178
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:46,110
requirement to be considered a whiskey a
lot of moon shines at you see in the

179
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,649
store are not based not not grain-based
are actually called based on sugar so

180
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:51,520
they basically

181
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,840
sugar shines where they've taken that
basically a pot of water done too much

182
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,490
sugar in it and infirm into that and
still a lot of course and cordials like

183
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,920
Southern Comfort Irish mist are not
considered to be whiskeys because they

184
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,670
don't they don't meet the legal
requirements for that and then there's

185
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:16,220
this stuff which obviously not a whiskey
I I found this somewhere alcohol free

186
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,930
flavored whiskey drink yeah but shit
outta me

187
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:29,430
ok no whiskey producing countries so
there's a 23 countries today in the

188
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,720
today that produced country that
produced whiskeys Scotland is by far the

189
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:42,360
largest producer I think last year they
the export in 2014 Scotland exported the

190
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,780
equivalent of three hundred and
thirty-three olympic-sized swimming

191
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:52,210
pools of whiskey in one year nine
million cases or something like that I

192
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,420
1915 + active distilleries I can no
longer keep up with how fast salaries

193
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,110
are popping up in scotland when I first
started doing these talks about 99 now

194
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:09,760
our apt 215 the United States has over
500 active distilleries you can buy you

195
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,360
can go and find a distillery in every
state in the Union and in washingtonDC

196
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,679
where there are actually two stories
actually inside washington DC's

197
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,240
third-largest producer believe in Japan
they have nine active distilleries in

198
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,230
Japan in the seven of the nine

199
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:33,710
and producer really really nice whiskey
in Japan Ireland Ireland free probation

200
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,059
Ireland had more distilleries in
Scotland they had someone in a bit of

201
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:40,700
about 200 axillary probation pretty much
wiped them out at the end of probation

202
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,630
when they came out a provision that had
three actors stories they're back up to

203
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,020
12 now then there's the rest of the
world Canada in da Europe Taiwan

204
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:57,320
Australia Tasmania Belgium all over the
place so something's gonna run sometimes

205
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,678
you run across distillers and appease an
independent bottlers so distillers

206
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,510
pretty obvious and still are somebody
who has a license and actually still

207
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,860
have some call the DSP number

208
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,809
distilled spirits producer license to
destroy my workout our numbers fifteen

209
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:23,190
0:32 have to stand on every barrel that
we produce things like this till by with

210
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,130
the address where they're from

211
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:34,070
addresses worry distilled and on the
packaging they're very proud of that and

212
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,240
they'll either be a branded house her
house of brands and other by Brandon

213
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,520
Howe something like makers mark
everything that makers mark produces is

214
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:47,918
its makers mark something may have heard
of its story called heaven Hill to

215
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,150
Heaven Hills was called the house of
brands heaven Hill doesn't actually

216
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:56,100
produce a whiskey ads as heaven Hill on
it they produce whiskeys for like Evan

217
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,699
Williams and large Craig and Parker's
heritage those types of things again

218
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,100
they produced their big house and
produces a lot of different brands non

219
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:11,939
distiller producers these guys are the
disguised as a source spirit from other

220
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:20,380
distilleries and then a bottle it and
marketed as their own brand now so

221
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:26,760
they're not necessarily always clear
about things for instance if you pick up

222
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,790
a bottle of whistle pig Rai you look at
that bile you swear to God that we try

223
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:41,420
was made in the whistle pig farms in
vermont a bottle of whiskey in Canada

224
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:48,860
trucked into whistle pig farm so that
they can any people typically put things

225
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:55,090
on there like produced by hand crafted
by or produced in but they won't put

226
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,500
distilled on the bottle unless they say
the still by and they named the

227
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:05,060
distillery that's the only way they can
put the still buying the bottle is very

228
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:14,330
truthful either even if you call
Florence Kentucky and say please give me

229
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,780
the address of the bullet distillery
they won't be able to because there is

230
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,080
no such thing as a bowl of the story
doesn't exist

231
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,909
bullet actually they're all the Bulleit
Bourbon was actually produced by for

232
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:34,630
roses and bottled by the bullet
distilling company and sold anyway and

233
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,680
forcing if you pick up available in
distilled by which is a flagrant

234
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,780
violation of the law but the TTC you
keep separate EDB who keeps up with all

235
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,590
this stuff is this morning was talking
about enforcement is not enforcement

236
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,709
they don't have an enforcement arm so we
as an industry are supposed to self

237
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,250
police and that with more and more
that's happening because some guys have

238
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,040
been caught in been tagged so for
instance templeton this now had to set

239
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,620
up a 2.5 million dollar fund to pay
their people who bought Templeton rye

240
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:16,139
six bucks a bottle up to $36 because
basically they got they got challenged

241
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,900
in court

242
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,490
and we're fine for mislabeling their
bottles so right

243
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,350
last one is independent bottlers
independent bottlers these these are

244
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,490
these are the options of the whiskey
brokers of old back in the eighteenth

245
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,270
and nineteenth century early 19th
century when you want to buy whiskey

246
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,430
announced local package store you
actually had to go into a store front

247
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:45,180
will that store owner was a grocery
store or pub would go to a whiskey

248
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:50,100
broker to buy literally by a full barrel
of whiskey that's what you when you

249
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,639
brought your own container down and you
gave it to them and they filled it up

250
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,790
for you and you went on about your
business

251
00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:00,629
these brokers eventually started
bottling their own bottling whiskey on

252
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,330
their own in labeling those bottles and
when they did they actually label did

253
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:10,639
with the actual name of the distillery
was much more open and honest and we see

254
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,260
a lot of the NDP is today today
independent bottlers will source whiskey

255
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:21,260
from other distilleries they will then
several other things if it's a raw

256
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,820
spirit though sources tell racket
themselves and put it in their own

257
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,290
warehouses in ages and eventually get to
the point where they're ready to bottle

258
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,370
it if it's an age spirit they might do
some enhancements like it into a

259
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:38,629
different style barrel aged for a bit
longer investigate around selling it but

260
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,030
the thing is they they bottle it under
their own label but they're very clear

261
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,110
about who the distillery is on the
bottles so you can always find out

262
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,659
exactly where it is

263
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:55,160
came from the equipment necessary to
distill first thing you need is a mill

264
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:03,000
grinder the grains into the mash two
types of meals are used to be in the

265
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,550
market sales will call the hammer mill
which is exactly what it sounds like

266
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,550
pistons it come down the drain

267
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:14,659
animals are not real popular because
they don't give you much control over

268
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,230
the size of a particular matter that you
want to generate those things in general

269
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,520
I sheet and he can score just the grain
if he scores degree in that case shows

270
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,910
up in the whiskey the other type of
Illinois market is called a roller mill

271
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,770
and it's exactly what it sounds like you
have a couple rollers in that you can

272
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,970
set to reset the depth of the rollers
and the green passes through the rollers

273
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,240
where it gets crushed when the roller
mill designers came up with a little

274
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,250
ingenious design in addition to the
rollers who actually put striations on

275
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,240
the roller so Scott ridges on it so in
addition to actually crushing the green

276
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,380
when it passes it sure is it raining
much more surface area where the surface

277
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,190
area because later on cooking process
that helps to draw starches next thing

278
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,580
you need is a quicker in English discuss
problems is called the mash tun this is

279
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,550
a example of about a hundred gallons
could find in a micro distillery this is

280
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:15,960
a 25,000 leader lashed Japan so you can
be used to cook the grains when she got

281
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,860
the green skirt you need of some sort of
fermentation tank to put them in a

282
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:29,459
fermentation vessel in the back these
are large large vessels that are closed

283
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,720
but just big stainless steel tank is or
they can be open to the air like these

284
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:43,020
are old wooden backs are next thing you
need is a still this is the business

285
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,010
into the deal still basically can come
in different styles their pot sales

286
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:53,310
these are a couple of different parts
tools that are still in Japan these

287
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,580
typically when you find pot stills and
particularly bird production of Scotch

288
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:07,530
whisky you find in pairs they come still
or stripping stillness still a reason

289
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:12,960
for two different stuff I stills is
because in the pot stills process you

290
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,460
cannot generate enough alcohol with one
run you have to run it twice in order to

291
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,860
get the alcohol content high enough so I
can type of skills which are typically

292
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,889
find in a bourbon distillery in the USSR
in a great just to recall the column

293
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,600
still

294
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,530
coffee still continues till or patent
still copy still is named after an iced

295
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:36,290
coffee was the guy who was a Scotsman
who actually designed this thing back in

296
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,040
the 1800's

297
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,920
consoles are typically be anywhere from
24 to 48 inches in diameter and thirty

298
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,590
to sixty feet tall as a continuous still
because once the stills been charged and

299
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,370
balanced as long as you squirt your
match in at the top of the still and

300
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,540
steam in at the bottom of still produce
whiskey ok you never have to turn it off

301
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,960
as long as you can keep it going

302
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,940
pasta which is a batch batch device she
loaded up with your mash at one time

303
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,460
then you gotta stop clean it out and do
it all again a lot of micro distilleries

304
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,110
go to a gun to whether known as hybrid
still ok this is a combination of a pot

305
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,790
on the bottom and a column on the top

306
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,990
this is actually one of the stills out
of place I work

307
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,210
500 gallon job kinda gives you the best
of both worlds you get some of the

308
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,110
benefits that are known to come with a
pot still plus that you get the doubling

309
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,429
effector tripling effectively column on
the top and order so that we only have

310
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:37,070
to do a single run every time we do this
almost all still as you find in the

311
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,500
market today are made of copper and they
made a copper because the copper

312
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,640
actually interact with the spirit also
fights and other impurities out of the

313
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,380
spirit during the installation process
so when she got everything distilled and

314
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,980
buy her a barrel deprecated have a place
to put it

315
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,770
warehouses typically are done each type
warehouses what you'll find in the UK

316
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:04,900
and these will be essentially stone
buildings dirt floors single-story no

317
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:10,360
windows not a lot of room for air
movement in the thing you go to Kentucky

318
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,699
you're here you find these big behemoths
look like something that these things

319
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:21,700
are multi-story they will be designed to
either hold barrels in and large rocks

320
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:28,240
or they'll be designed to hold hearings
on Palace now one thing is universal

321
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,340
about most of these warehouses there is
no temperature control in the warehouse

322
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,280
that's because we want to see
temperature cycles and talk a bit about

323
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,450
that in a bit

324
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,130
the only temperature control I'm aware
of any of the warehouses are some of the

325
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,130
warehouses in Kentucky actually have a
heating system in it but that's just

326
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,070
there to keep the sprinkler pipes from
freezing

327
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:55,178
as the only reason they're they're
bottling line and this is another place

328
00:28:55,179 --> 00:29:00,669
where things get weird between the USA
and the rest of the world there are lots

329
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:03,230
and lots and lots of whiskies out there
that never make their way into the

330
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:07,620
united states for the simple fact that
they bottled using a 700 milliliter

331
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:14,158
bottle and USB required by using a 750
milliliter bottle so a lot of places

332
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,220
don't want to go to the expense of
having to be able to set up two separate

333
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,799
bottling lines or take bill to deal with
two penalties different sizes works both

334
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,350
ways for not a lot of this lot of
whiskey in the USA people overseas it

335
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:31,590
would like to get their hands on but the
bottlers here I will put in a seven-run

336
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:39,259
milliliter bottom line I said what's it
take to make cereal grains barley corn

337
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:45,539
wheat rye oats millet sorghum which is
made with triticale which is a week

338
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:58,100
right hybrid and and quinoa yeah it's ok
I'll take your word for it actually when

339
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:06,428
I mention this in in in the name of the
group side I deal with I have jewish

340
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:11,309
and when I started talking about the
chemo was pretty excited because during

341
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,720
Passover there's certain restrictions
that they have about some of the spirits

342
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,350
of the game used during Passover in and
anyway

343
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:26,570
expects pam was pretty excited about
this is a key to use during the Passover

344
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,529
need to have a yeast has to be a
distillers East designed to take the

345
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:37,720
temperatures in the alcohol
concentrations fermentation tank they

346
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,080
can come in different forms they can be
powered yeast income as a promotion cake

347
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,820
most the time comes a slurry no prior to
probation pretty much every distal had

348
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,580
their own East provision thank you very
much wiped out a lot of the she's

349
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,049
culture so now most of the east that
they distill reviews will come from a

350
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:59,580
large laboratory uses important in the

351
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:05,040
in the production process because of
weather brings to the whiskey 25% your

352
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,020
flavor profile is going to come from the
east

353
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,320
uses responsible for the floral notes
that you get on a whiskey and for the

354
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,840
free pretty things that you'll taste and
whiskey

355
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,159
all comes from the east

356
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,230
obviously if that water to make sure
that the water and then you have wood in

357
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:28,650
the form of a barrel to put the product
in when she got a distillation run and

358
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:35,340
then I mentioned get heat he's necessary
for the aging process off we start with

359
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,740
a process called molting where we
actually malt barley barley is used

360
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,490
because it contains alpha and beta a
malaise enzymes that are necessary for

361
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,390
the conversion of starch into sugar ok
they also have enzymes and that will

362
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,560
help break proteins down into product
that these can actually metabolize

363
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:00,700
throughout this whole process where
after sugar ok sugar feeds the yeast

364
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,940
malt barley century which you'll end up
doing is you take the barley after it's

365
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,710
dried so could step in water to three
times so you get a good and wet and then

366
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:16,360
you spread it out on a multi floor where
you'll keep it continue to keep it moist

367
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,300
and you continue to turn it over the
ideas you wanna get the ball rolling to

368
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,430
Germany Germany's that process creates
all these additional enzymes that you're

369
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,070
looking for

370
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,429
after about three to five days is start
to germinate you can stop the

371
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,210
germination process that's typically
done with heat so you keep you looking

372
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:41,030
for enlarged large operations what
they'll do is they'll shoot into a large

373
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:45,629
kill and then dried in the killing which
stops germination process if you wanna

374
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,900
make a period whiskey then things get a
little different right to make a period

375
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:56,230
with you drive the barley using peat
smoke so that the malting floors are

376
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,590
designed such that they have got
channels underneath him and and the

377
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:03,659
smoke will you push the smoke up and it
passes upward see the barley and then

378
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,430
the females that are in the peace mobile
attach themselves to the bar and that

379
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,340
that comes out

380
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:16,370
and that's what the smoky smoky flavors
that you get in a multiple independent

381
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,809
barley so I have a male next to grind up
the grain we talked a bit about that

382
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:25,440
again pointed right in the grain is to
create surface area the more service so

383
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,460
you can create a more interaction there
can be with the enzymes in the water and

384
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:37,429
the drought starches and sugars next
step is cooking or matching this season

385
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:43,100
takes place in a large cooker some sort
of dumped grain you start putting green

386
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,110
in you bring the temperature of the
water up typically turn the matching

387
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:51,830
process you said temperatures it will be
three different temperature sets as we

388
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,610
found is that different grains will
respond to different temperatures when

389
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:00,820
it comes to being able to extract sugars
and for metals and the water soluble

390
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:08,179
starch is out once you're done with the
matching process everything calms down

391
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,889
then you pitched the yeast and you go
into the fermentation tanks permutations

392
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:19,339
metabolic process by which these
converts sugar into acids gases and

393
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:23,960
alcohol the alcohol rafters obviously
ethanol gas that comes off as carbon

394
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,369
dioxide this shot is a picture of one of
our tanks where I'd actually pulled the

395
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:31,700
green cap back to be able to expose
illiquid Indonesian and what you see

396
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:41,118
there is that's it's actually carbon
dioxide bubbling up off the tank

397
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:47,480
if you if you heard the term sour mash
star matches as a process whereby you at

398
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,710
the end of the fermentation process you
capture some of the match that you

399
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,460
finished with and actually put it into
the next batch of match that you want to

400
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,150
run in order to basically helped
kick-start the fermentation process as

401
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:08,119
well as it was found out the acidity of
the new mash when you're done with this

402
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,359
process we have some call distillers
beer essentially anywhere from seven to

403
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:20,038
11 percent alcohol by volume its taste
pretty nasty and not something you ever

404
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:24,119
tried to drink at this point you're
ready to transfer into the stills

405
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:31,849
different stories do a different ways
they did they run the transfers we

406
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:38,140
transfer everything into our fossils ok
so we send mash liquid whole batch of

407
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,710
designer but still larger distilleries a
used condom sales have to filter out the

408
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,249
man at the filter out the particular
matter in the mash that can be done in

409
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:50,868
the in the mashed in the actually in the
fermentation vessel itself some of them

410
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:54,680
have false bottoms on that you can
actually drain drain the liquid off and

411
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,308
the particular matter actually acts as a
filter said that Pakistan's green so

412
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:05,119
that when they pull off is basically a
clear liquid so distillation is

413
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,710
essentially a mechanical separation and
all the boys $175 agrees yet what it

414
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,460
boils at 212 we want SNL we don't want
water so the objective is to keep the

415
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,319
still somewhere between 1774 degrees and
212 degrees not everything that comes

416
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:28,440
off the still is something you want to
drink ok at first the first batch of

417
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,529
stuff that comes off the still call
hands or four shots are not real

418
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:39,420
lightweight alcohols and things like
methanol and other compounds like

419
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:45,009
acetone that will kill you if you drink
them so we don't want those typically do

420
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:50,220
is a still operator will during the run
will set up this the switching

421
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,529
configuration on the receiver to capture

422
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:58,670
heads into a separate tank but for us
about 20 minutes into the distillation

423
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,360
run the character of this period starts
to change and we start getting what

424
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,080
we're looking for in terms of what we
know is the right characteristics for

425
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,990
Spierer after change configuration on
the receiver so that we start capturing

426
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,899
that referred to as the heart of the run
and will capture that in a separate tank

427
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:22,180
that'll go on for us anywhere from three
hours 24 hours then we start getting

428
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,710
into the tail end of the run the tail
into the run you get into things called

429
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,170
fuselage oils are not actually oils are
just large same alcohol molecules but

430
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:34,090
again not something you want in the
spirit because my description of your

431
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:38,680
soil's in the heavier alcohol causes its
they they taste and smell like the

432
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,580
inside of an old dirty gym locker so
again not something you want to have

433
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:47,720
your whiskey so will capture those and
set them aside in some instances we will

434
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,009
actually take those heads and tails once
we get about seven hundred gallons of

435
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,400
and go back and read still on and we
found as we can actually pull about 220

436
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,960
gallons good spirit in the tales because
of the cut processes not rule will find

437
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:14,670
with respect to ransack you mentioned
earlier possibility to have to do two

438
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:25,570
runs to do you stripping around in your
spirit run and aging I get a lot of

439
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,920
questions about aging and maturation
there's a lot of stuff going on in the

440
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,200
market today about people trying to
speed up the aging process

441
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,490
pardon

442
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:44,250
well my experience so far is it so badly
bullshit ok aging is called aging for a

443
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,710
reason it takes time

444
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:52,530
ok you can spend a whole day on talking
about the impact of the wood has on the

445
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,950
whiskey its east is responsible for 25
percent of flavor profile the was

446
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:00,240
responsible for anywhere from six to
fifty to sixty percent of labor profile

447
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,319
American oak type of what do we use
their over a hundred and thirty

448
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,440
different flavor compounds have been
identified in there so things like

449
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:15,940
vanilla caramel chocolate leather ash
the actual ok itself all those flavors

450
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:22,170
that you pick up in a whiskey all come
from the wood

451
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:28,340
charred marble for a couple reasons
number one is is that the char charring

452
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,700
actually creates a charcoal barrier
between whiskey and the action would

453
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:38,129
cause the whiskey passes to the charcoal
barrier that a charcoal filter the other

454
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,360
reason for charging it is a charming bus
up to capillary surface of the wood to

455
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,030
go deeper into the wood and then also
criminalizes the winners and makes them

456
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:51,880
available to the whiskey there is a ton
of chemistry that goes on inside the

457
00:39:51,880 --> 00:40:00,030
barrel impacted the barrel has charged
levels of anything from a toast which is

458
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,430
essentially where they'll raise the
temperature inside the world about 450

459
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:07,759
degrees it doesn't actually burn the
wood just toast would have to ask Allah

460
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,230
for plus which is also known as the
alligator charged because he looks like

461
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:18,500
an alligator skin or + typically the
barrel sit on the burner 444 about 55

462
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:24,400
seconds aloft actual fire

463
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:34,099
not to mention there's no heating
typically in a warehouse is because

464
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,770
we're looking for temperature cycling
the temperature cycling is necessary to

465
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,029
draw the whiskey into the woods during
summer time when things are hot girls

466
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:44,990
expand the whiskey is drawn into the
wood where has a chance to do all of

467
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,069
that nice chemical interaction that goes
on during the wintertime the bills will

468
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:51,990
contract pushes the whiskey this in the
would back out into the into the center

469
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:57,500
of the barrel is to mix with all the way
to get drawn into the wood and that that

470
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,960
cycle goes back and forth several times
the state on a barrel were typically be

471
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,420
about an inch thick the whiskey if you
take an independent ticket stay about

472
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,779
look at it the whiskey line which is the
indication of how far into the barrel

473
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:22,230
was gone about three quarters of an inch
so the whiskey is drawn with all this

474
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:28,020
temperature cycling back and Poor's also
results in evaporation and the term we

475
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,450
use for it in the industry's Angel share
every time the barrel expands wheelies

476
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:40,038
whiskey whiskey whiskey nothing to do
about it it's just what you give up in

477
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,990
scotland this one to three percent Texas
is anywhere from three to five percent

478
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,950
to go to India they're screwed over
there cuz it's anywhere from 8 12

479
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:53,649
percent and determine just comes from
Scotland and if you ask the Scottish

480
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:59,559
distiller what it's called the Angels
share basically the Angels share is the

481
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:07,410
amount of whiskey that it's taken out of
the barrels by the Angels as a result of

482
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:13,368
God teaching man had to make whiskey so
after the aging is done you'll end up

483
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:21,089
taking the barrels dumped into a
blending tank where you basically Mary

484
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:27,609
up for a bit and then they'll be ready
to go into the filtration others couple

485
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:31,279
different types of filtration basically
when this particular matter when the

486
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:35,579
dump the barrels a lot of that charcoal
is on the inside the girls often ends up

487
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,569
being in the whiskey see it to filter
that out there is another type of

488
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:42,799
filtration cultural filtration and
whiskey that are less than 40 46 percent

489
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:48,400
alcohol by volume 10 the cloud when they
get cold cloudiness comes from the fact

490
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,760
that some of the long chain molecules
alcohol kills and was he start to clump

491
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,920
together it's doesn't impact the flavor
of the whiskey but it does impact the

492
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,650
visual appeal so to keep that from
happening with a lot of $2 distillers

493
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,760
will do with election go to chill
filtration process will take the whiskey

494
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,220
drive the temperature down about 2
degrees centigrade run it's a real fine

495
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:27,640
steel mesh filter and then bottle it
will get to that yeah that's different

496
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:37,990
marketing marketing yeah so it's just a
play on words that the taste good and

497
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:44,370
just telling you just as a marketing
thing right so when you ready to go

498
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:49,200
after bottling so now you that your
father whiskey yes about the labeling

499
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,509
right so there are certain things are
required to be on the label address is

500
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,570
still release the city and state has to
be on there there's the ubiquitous

501
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,780
health warning about drinking while
you're pregnant

502
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,280
alcohol content has to be on the bottle
and then there's an if it's underaged

503
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,440
American whiskey there needs to be a
statement on their upheld the whiskey is

504
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,630
mentioned it yet it's an American
whiskey epicenter just under four years

505
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,480
of age have been aged for less than four
years you have to somewhere on the

506
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,100
bottle I have to tell you with the ages
little bit more about age statements age

507
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:29,390
statements are is the age of the
youngest whiskey in the bottle when they

508
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:35,819
got a bottle of whiskey barrels from the
warehouse in those barrels can be

509
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,770
different ages because they're looking
for specific flavor profile so they're

510
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:43,230
going to go after different barrels
together to create that flavor profile

511
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:48,100
the age statement on the bottle will be
the age of the youngest barrel-a-day

512
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,549
pulled so if you go out and buy a 12
year old single malt scotch that single

513
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:59,190
malt scotch as twelve years old and some
of the mall somewhere about forty years

514
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:10,620
old and a 12 year olds got something to
be aware of and proof vs ABV in Aus we

515
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:16,640
still use the term proof a lot is
basically in in for us proof is

516
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,160
essentially twice you have alcohol by
volume everywhere else in the world

517
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,589
interesting thing about where it came
from

518
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:31,180
originated in the 16th century when the
British Navy paid their sailors part of

519
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:36,359
their pay was they got a daily run
ration taught

520
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:40,440
and to ensure that the water in the room
hadn't been watered down what they would

521
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,799
do is it would take the room and they
would soak gunpowder with it and then

522
00:45:44,799 --> 00:45:49,099
they would like the Gunpowder on fire
while the Gunpowder burned then that was

523
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:54,829
proof that the whiskey had not been in
Waterdown sufficient to the point where

524
00:45:54,829 --> 00:46:00,109
it wouldn't burn if they didn't burn is
considered under proof so happens that

525
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:07,848
whiskey rum rum had to be at least 57
percent alcohol by volume in order for

526
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,329
the gunpowder burns so in the UK up
until nineteen eighty if you talked

527
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:16,839
about a hundred proof whiskey that was
57 percent alcohol by volume 1980 they

528
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:22,819
changed a lot over so you Suz pretty
much the only country in the world

529
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:27,440
proof on the bottle so I think you'll
find on the label

530
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,599
you'll see the term straight a lot on
American whiskeys it has nothing to do

531
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:35,249
with the sexual proclivity of the
distiller or the whiskey straight just

532
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:43,118
means whiskeys been aged at least two
years single cask or single barrel means

533
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,079
exactly what it says on the bottle came
out of a single cask her single barrel

534
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,960
if it's says Cass strength to bear
approved the bile the whiskey was not

535
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,980
watered down there wasn't deleted down
in the bottle is exactly what came out

536
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,539
of the cask bottling bond is another
expression for American whiskeys pretty

537
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:05,599
interesting it we don't do it much
anymore basically it was an American

538
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,849
whiskey using a bourbon that had to meet
the criteria of being bottled by singled

539
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:17,640
a single distiller in a single season
age for four years and bottle it percent

540
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:25,910
maybe we talked about that a little
earlier in the legislative process for

541
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:33,190
picking up their termination small batch
is a marketing term back in nineteen

542
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:37,119
late nineteen eighties Jim Beam came
came up with a terrible idea small batch

543
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,319
indicate that a whiskey bottle and the
bottles of blending of a small a small

544
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,630
batch barrels

545
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:50,370
small for being as relative because the
basil Hayden which is a beam product is

546
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:56,790
a small batch thing and they blame like
forty thousand barrels to practice in

547
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,380
other words it doesn't really have a
legal definition it she's a used to

548
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:06,920
indicate a small story although a buyer
beware

549
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,170
and then you'll see the turn-on chill
filtered water bottles wells sometimes

550
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:20,540
finishes finishes you see the word a lot
on the Scotch whiskies Jim McEwan who

551
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:24,870
said master distiller Bruichladdich
refers to this is a shit word he says

552
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:29,170
israelis alternate cask enhancement what
you're doing is you're taking the

553
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,700
whiskey out of the caskets and your dump
it in a different cast typically sherry

554
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,589
cask hers some other fortified wine or
rum cask allowing it to age longer maybe

555
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:45,880
another two years or whatnot before you
then bottle it this is actually a sherry

556
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:54,630
cask finish bottling right here from
Seattle Washington where they've done a

557
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:59,660
single malt whisky then put it in a
shared using pretty easy to tell sherry

558
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:07,009
cask because they'll be nice to read

559
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:22,590
yeah beer barrel yeah they've there's a
lot going on where you'll take a bourbon

560
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:28,670
distillery will take barrels and pass
them off to a to a girl then put aged

561
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:34,890
beer in the barrel and sell it as a in
Texas where r has a dozen the Collie

562
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:41,950
Bourbon Barrel winter warmer jamison
just in the last month is really

563
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:45,799
something called castmates where they
took a they took their Irish whiskey

564
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,000
barrels gave him to a local distiller

565
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,640
who killed the barrels with a stout
agent for six months into it gave the

566
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:59,819
key back in the barrels agent for
another six months and then they're

567
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:09,250
selling that is called castmates again
it's an interesting stuff so glassware

568
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:15,070
and whiskey this this is the iconic this
is Glenn caring last the iconic scotch

569
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:23,670
glass all designed for very specific
very specific way the ideas is to hold a

570
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:27,080
fair amount of whiskey get a good two
answers in there but the next away the

571
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,990
next down is designed to concentrate the
aroma is right at the nose of the glass

572
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:36,669
right at the neck of the glass so you
get a good good whiff of it I like this

573
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,070
class is called the ground glass this is
what we actually used to all over since

574
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:45,930
we were still re- there's also compete
in those in class and then if you want

575
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:50,740
to drink it you know other than straight
there's the typical rocks glass so

576
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:58,120
drinking it straight need most whiskey
distilled and proved to the point where

577
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:03,630
the designed to be drank straight
however comma barrels last castro's

578
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,380
caution some barrels drink whiskey
forecasting Twistys can be pretty stout

579
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,820
to try to drink 62% by alcohol

580
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:16,460
can be kind of rough water I encourage
people to put a drop or two of water in

581
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,420
the whiskey that there's an actual
chemical reaction that occurs when you

582
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,310
do that actually opens the whiskey yep
not the ethanol down you get a lot more

583
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:29,750
fruity esters and floral scents of the
whiskey and I mean a drop I mean just a

584
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:35,730
drop ok I'm not talking about dumping a
half a glass of water in there you can

585
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:40,300
also drink whiskey on the rocks lot of
back and forth about this whether this

586
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,560
is good or not because the ice does the
cold does actually influence of labor if

587
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,509
your gonna drink it on the rocks the big
ice balls work the best because

588
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,690
basically the way he gets children gets
dumped on the top but then there's not a

589
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:56,260
lot of contact between the whiskey and
ice after that so it doesn't get watered

590
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,140
down and then if you don't want to drink
it straight then there's always

591
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,569
cocktails right now Manhattan or
old-fashioned so picking up picking a

592
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:09,470
whiskey if you if you decide to try to
find a whiskey there's a lot of guys out

593
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:15,370
there who write tasting notes ok this is
all very subjective ok what one person

594
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:18,640
gets into whiskey and other person may
or may not get the same thing if you

595
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,680
find a writer that writes notes that you
agree with you find it then stick with

596
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:30,100
that guy ok in and used as a guide
however be aware that you are

597
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:36,339
susceptible ok its aromas and whiskies
are basically tied to your memories and

598
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:41,460
you're gonna be susceptible to
suggestion so when I do tastings with

599
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,490
people you know I never say anything
about what I'm getting until somebody

600
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:49,100
else but as soon as somebody says all I
guess I can smell cherry blossoms or

601
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,330
something like that everybody in the
room because if they know a cherry

602
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:56,759
blossoms smell like you don't have never
smelled them you won't pick that up so

603
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,690
quickly clubs a lot of clubs out there
the club I go to typically every Friday

604
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:09,060
night this is what the table looks like
okay and most was the clubs are more

605
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:14,060
than happy to welcome in doesn't cost
anything you have the opportunity to try

606
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:18,460
all different kinds of whiskeys and you
know if you're fortunate they'll be guys

607
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,650
that are are knowledgeable what's going
on there that will help you through

608
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:22,589
anything you wanted

609
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:27,930
know about whiskeys alright or find a
good whiskey bar most good whiskey bar

610
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:33,049
selection flights so he can done they'll
have preset flights it'll be like six

611
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:38,279
out of six half hours that you can go
through for relatively inexpensive price

612
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:42,529
and give you a wide range of whiskies to
try so when you first approach of

613
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:47,690
whiskey you know eyeball it by that I
mean get the whiskey in the glass and

614
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:51,299
swirled around the glass and look at it
seems like just like you look four legs

615
00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:54,469
and wine look pretty legs in the whiskey
they'll give you an indication of what

616
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:59,329
the mouthfeel can be coated glass and
running down the glass cases can be

617
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:07,650
kinda only and should never really gets
me feel knows it by saying no is it time

618
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:12,390
to people who knows who else can they do
this you know that knows I'm not get you

619
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:18,670
know that the glass ok now don't stick
your nose in the Glasgow ok if you do

620
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:22,890
are you gonna do is burn off all the
sensors and your nose when you do that

621
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:27,660
last open your mouth breathe through
your mouth ok when you inhale see your

622
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:33,799
mouth it'll draw draw air sea unos ok
and you'll get you'll get a lot of

623
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:37,799
flavor you won't get a lot of the
ethanol Casey won't burn burn your nose

624
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:45,690
out obviously taste it in my state and I
don't mean just swallowed get him out

625
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:49,249
swirled around you got thousands of
taste receptors in your and your tongue

626
00:54:49,249 --> 00:54:54,209
exercise all of them there's a guy named
Richard Patterson who says it basically

627
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,930
you should keep the whiskey in your
mouth one second for every year old with

628
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:06,989
me finish it you're looking for
basically the after effects of that when

629
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:10,660
you finish it open your mouth little bit
draw luminaire into your mouth don't

630
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,930
don't do big just a little bit ok
that'll help oxidized was left in your

631
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,960
mouth and change the flavor profile
quite a bit

632
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,910
the other thing is ticket I'm ok with
kids are designed to be drank over 10 15

633
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:26,019
20 30 minutes that changed the glass
longer says in the last searched

634
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:30,919
oxidized and you get all sorts of
different flavors hangovers right

635
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:39,130
lot there's no real scientific consensus
about why people get hangovers although

636
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:45,349
it should be pretty apparent from the
word ok alcohol is a toxin right when

637
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:50,809
you drink this stuff you're dumping
poison into your body when they buy

638
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:59,930
products in the metabolism is a seat
I'll hide hide hide acetaldehyde is one

639
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:06,210
of those things that again it is toxic
to your body and it's one of the key

640
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:11,799
contributors 222 a hangover getting as
they found that there's chemical

641
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:14,799
compounds called cytokines that are
released in your body

642
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,430
these are things that result in the
flu-like symptoms that you have a

643
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:22,940
hangover ok so the headache the Naija
those types of things this all comes

644
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:28,549
from these chemicals called cytokines
the other thing is is that people talk

645
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:35,849
about dehydration being cars for a
hangover not really it contributes but

646
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:40,390
it's not the cause so basically what
happens when you drink alcohol diuretic

647
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,940
makes you happy

648
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,059
does that because it suppresses basses
suppress present which is a is an enzyme

649
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:53,119
in your blood that causes your kidneys
essentially store water will when you

650
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,690
suppress that you get to stress that
threshold is at a point in time where

651
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,079
you start dancing around you gotta find
a bathroom right that's what the

652
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:04,049
floodgates open and you speak
continuously well we need to hydrate

653
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:07,540
your body like that then your body's
combat sub I started to squeeze down

654
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:13,680
blood vessels to slow the flow of blood
around your bodies but when that happens

655
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,890
your brain to dilate blood vessels in
the brain to get oxygen and water to the

656
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:24,239
brain which puts pressure on your school
which gives you a headache

657
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:29,799
how to avoid a hangover well don't get
drunk as simple as that just don't know

658
00:57:29,799 --> 00:57:36,019
any you can drink and not get drunk I do
I do it every Friday night ok in Texas

659
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:40,959
concealed handgun license holders there
is no legal limit ok if they pull you

660
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:46,749
over and they test you and you're like
oh one percent in your blood bank you're

661
00:57:46,749 --> 00:57:48,919
going to jail

662
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:54,169
yeah so I'm a CHL holder I'm not about
to get pulled over so I can drink all

663
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:59,308
night and not get your so keep food in
your stomach particularly fatty things

664
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,709
right

665
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:05,249
stomach doesn't do real well it at
resolving alcohol not near as efficient

666
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:08,479
as your intestines are you keep your
stomach in the pyloric valve in your

667
00:58:08,479 --> 00:58:11,859
stomach between your stomach and
intestine stays close so rather than the

668
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:15,299
alcove sliding into your intestines it
just trickles in so that you don't

669
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:18,569
deserve as fast drinks lower right

670
00:58:18,569 --> 00:58:22,279
strongly flavored drink so if you drink
if you drink things are strongly

671
00:58:22,279 --> 00:58:26,509
flavored you tend to drink them slower
ok as opposed to your body which has no

672
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:30,909
flavor which people pound in the new
wonder why they get drunk avoid

673
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:34,719
carbonation combination actually speeds
up the the absorption of alcohol in your

674
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:39,579
blood system unless you're drinking
slower and they found that most people

675
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:43,139
drink carbonated beverages actually do
drinks lower than non-carbonated

676
00:58:43,139 --> 00:58:48,619
beverages avoid diet sodas diet sodas
will cause your stomach to empty 75

677
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:53,149
percent faster than a regular soda will
get a drink your drink with diet sodas

678
00:58:53,149 --> 00:58:59,578
with carbonated soda used a fall wedding
stuff don't don't go with the diet thing

679
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:08,029
we do all those things and hopefully
you'll avoid this problem is here so

680
00:59:08,029 --> 00:59:11,379
gaelic / iPod is good health

681
00:59:11,379 --> 00:59:15,328
member what was he will not cure there's
no cure for and down in the corner
