1
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,830
was actors

2
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,028
good afternoon when is Paul Burbage
ex-lax on the twitters the Twittersphere

3
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:32,259
first of which ones as scout.com thanks
for having already becoming one of my

4
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,180
favorite conferences thanks for coming
out even after lunch it was kind of

5
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,570
tired so little bit about myself on our
researcher fish me and one of my

6
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,140
passions dealing with malware is setting
those Mauer families that utilize some

7
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,010
sort of PHP control panel and then you
know researching the vulnerabilities

8
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,140
within those one of my hobbies is
playing the drums and listen to music

9
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:06,470
course really like truman base trance
gold nineties grounds of course so feel

10
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,390
free to hit me up on this waters are the
email their cover I Jennifer this

11
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,450
presentation about what the frak is an
exploit kit will dive into

12
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,190
under the hood of hundred exploit kit
itself there's a recent campaign that

13
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,470
you may have heard of it was in the news
recently brought to life by proof points

14
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,819
all go over that the drop now we're from
that campaign and then starting to

15
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,369
getting to the vulnerabilities
themselves of the administrative panel

16
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:41,720
also have some proof of concept code
that I can share with you all really

17
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,239
just wrote it for the demo but I put it
up on again and you'll be able to play

18
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,160
with that as well

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,640
and finally as the end user you know
utilizing Windows what they can do to

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,720
mitigate some of these issues with
exploit kids are so little disclaimer

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,170
though since the proof of concept is
considered 0 day as far as I know has

22
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,009
been passed in awhile so definitely
don't wanna play with that at home

23
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:14,020
unless you want to be visited by people
with suits so show of hands here who

24
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,790
knows what exploit kit is

25
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,469
a few people ok for those that don't
let's go ahead and ask Eleni and exploit

26
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,319
kit also known as exploit pack is a tool
that automates the exploitation of

27
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,730
client-side vulnerabilities usually
targeting browsers in programs that a

28
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,810
website can invoke through the browser
such as Adobe Flash Adobe Reader or Java

29
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:46,590
Runtime Environment they can mister
seltzer taking you through the typical

30
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,730
exploitation of victims utilizing a web
browser initially they might receive a

31
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,138
link within a matter of hours man
campaign that redirect them to an

32
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:03,470
exploit kit but sometimes I might be no
user interaction all just solely through

33
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:09,659
typical web browsing there might be some
type of mouth advertising on the web

34
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,060
site that they're visiting or
compromised website that then redirect

35
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,689
them silently to that exploit kit and
fix their PC and dropped them out where

36
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:27,228
the victim's computer so the sole
purpose in life of an excellent kate is

37
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:31,430
mainly to install malware without any
user intervention so as you can imagine

38
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,069
some of his mouth where actors they're
utilizing you know massive now we're

39
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,220
spam campaigns that requires some sort
of social engineering attacks initially

40
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,310
to get that power installed but with an
exploit kid you know as long as there is

41
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,560
a horrible browser session that's able
to drop that matter where there's not

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,409
too many social engineering attacks that
wouldn't you know need to fill that

43
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:55,880
space in order to get that malware
installed

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:03,240
picture up the left the guys from Friday
pretty scared about drug busts down at

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,410
the bottom there there's a screenshot of
the actual generation or where the

46
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,609
administrative user of hundred exploit
kit would upload their malware to the

47
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:22,060
panel in order to facilitate that
exploitation of a little bit under the

48
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,080
hood of her exploit kit itself so the
panel itself is are there explicate

49
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,810
itself is actually rebranded heroes
exploit kit I'm so not really sure about

50
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:39,830
the the ties between the author of these
kits it could be that it's the same you

51
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,680
know exploit kit offer that just
rebranded it or it could be that erodes

52
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,780
leaked and then it was just rebranded by
different individual sure so someone has

53
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,900
a copy that our news how to get a copy
I'd really like to see that code myself

54
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,979
hundred explica was actually first thing
in August 2015 and it can be rented $300

55
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,760
a week or $800 a month which is very
inexpensive compared to some of the more

56
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:13,240
well-known exploit kits that are out
there so she's neutrino or engler those

57
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,170
can go into the tens if not hundreds of
thousands of dollars a month just to

58
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,249
read those

59
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:27,689
so one thing about this particular
exploit kid there's very light plugin

60
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:33,239
checks to see if there's a particular
plugin available in the client session

61
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:38,508
and the way I like to think this is you
know a spray and pray shotgun other

62
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:44,449
people call it a carpet bomb method for
exploitation where regardless of the

63
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,799
session and pretty much every exploit
known to a browser session that's

64
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:55,119
available within the kit itself so the
panel claims about 20 exploits but in

65
00:05:55,119 --> 00:06:03,779
reality only about nine or usable mostly
targeting Adobe Flash screenshot here

66
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:10,539
within the administrative panel itself
of the exploits that it claims to be

67
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:16,509
capable of targeting the two red stars
over the top and it might be kinda hard

68
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,339
to see the seat numbers there on screen
but these were actually released or

69
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:30,860
found from within the the hacking team
data dump earlier this year

70
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:37,889
here's a forum advertisement underground
form of Louisville's exploit diane was

71
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,719
advertising this particular exploit kids
for its use and although the the Twitter

72
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:47,969
account down there at the bottom has
been suspended by Twitter doing a little

73
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:54,020
on that particular job XMPP account came
across two other Twitter accounts are

74
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:01,719
still active and it was in August of
this year the first Twitter account here

75
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:06,169
as you can see the the dates are so
pretty freshest still active

76
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:11,609
although the proof point article day
mainly found about this exploit kids

77
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,719
from Assam hours then campaign that all
share with you here in a bit

78
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:20,550
they sense that campaign is kinda
wrapped up they have not seen any active

79
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,710
threats from Hunter explicate although
it still being advertised so the idea

80
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:33,710
that this is still being utilized in the
wall is another screenshot here the

81
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:41,599
second account that I found utilizing
that same XMPP address and very recent

82
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,770
advertisements blowing up that first
advertisement you can see the date

83
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,008
stamped on there at the bottom just a
couple days ago and seems like every

84
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:53,520
couple days he pushes out this
advertisement for the UK that was pretty

85
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,159
funny included in the hashtag of
cyberwar when I first saw that I imagine

86
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:06,438
norad utilizing this exploit kit to
launch nukes so I mentioned earlier that

87
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:10,930
a proof point is pretty much the one
that publicly disclosed this particular

88
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,919
exploit kit and reached out to them
their research teams but also about you

89
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:23,430
know given me more data than what they
could publicly share and they had a very

90
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:29,020
large fish campaign for this particular
case back in August it utilized to send

91
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,380
them our or the spam campaign that
contain links to utilize PHP mailers on

92
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,760
compromised host to send those e-mails
these purported to be some type of fake

93
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:47,199
billing or traffic ticket and also even
coupon games mainly targeting the the

94
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:52,699
Brazilian ecosystem down there and being
the the language within the amount was

95
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:57,620
Portuguese and the type of malware that
was dropped called bankers banking

96
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,260
Trojan was solely targeting Brazilian
financial institutions not sure if too

97
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,550
many people are familiar with his family
but essentially it's an auto writes his

98
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,670
scripts that initially drops from
exploitation of the UK itself and then

99
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,390
from there this auto I T script
downloads the main payload of bankers

100
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:21,730
banking Trojan this particular family of
ours designed to capture user names and

101
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:31,230
passwords credentials solely for
Brazilian financial institutions so I

102
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,010
mentioned earlier when I recent up to
prove a point when I first started to

103
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:39,600
put some data together for this
presentation good body mind over there

104
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,699
by the name of Brian burns so some are
redacted headers and one on that initial

105
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:49,859
spectrum spam campaign what I found
within the headers had a X PHP script

106
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,600
tag with I am both 30 . PHP so luckily
was actually able to find this PHP

107
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,540
source code on pace pin and from there

108
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,699
dropped it onto a lab computer and
render day here in browser in this looks

109
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:13,790
like a very simple but again that's also
in Portuguese so fairly fairly safe to

110
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:21,529
say this was contained solely within the
country Brazil targeting Brazilian users

111
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:29,670
screenshot of one of the initial hours
pam's I'm sorry the redirected actual

112
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:36,860
exploit kit so the underlined text on
there was the dot zip on the bottom of

113
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,870
the screen there was a link to exploit
itself this one purporting to be some

114
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:53,059
sort of judicial or court notice to the
individual as a lower second one year

115
00:10:53,059 --> 00:11:00,829
claiming to be some sort of ticket
bolado I believe in Portuguese the down

116
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:04,910
at the bottom of this little bit cut off
but this was a fake image source tag

117
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:11,660
that tried to trick the user into
thinking that it was a PDF file that

118
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:19,399
they need to click on but in reality
again it just redirected to exploit it

119
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,730
finally the third one targeting
Brazilian chocolate lovers I guess this

120
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:34,470
is a coupon for collectible chocolates
so sorry to dive down into the actual

121
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,480
vulnerabilities of this exploit kit one
of the huge problems with in most

122
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,329
studies P panels from hours the lack of
user input validation so this the kit

123
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:52,779
source code itself actually leaked
September 2015 from a researcher

124
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,920
compromising the actual exploit kit
itself he made a copy of that leaked it

125
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,878
on or in underground forms so I was able
to grab a copy of that and screwed up to

126
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,230
lab whenever I initially look at PHP
code for vulnerability analysis they

127
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,350
utilize it open source program called
trips down there at the the get help

128
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,670
link and rips comes back and give you a
pretty good idea whether or not you know

129
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,870
there's some vulnerable pass you know
with any type of vulnerability

130
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,490
assessment you have to start weeding out
this false positives

131
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:33,320
so started to mainly just concentrated
on the the PHP upload formalities for

132
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,310
this presentation but also initial some
of the initial results also included

133
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:48,599
command execution as well as a sequence
action as well

134
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,430
diving into today I'm just as causing
one of the first PHP upload

135
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,790
vulnerability is for the panel itself
within the file he kid hyphen

136
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:04,610
dutasteride PHP there's series of checks
that it goes through this

137
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,630
the main purpose of this particular file
within the panel itself so the screen

138
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:14,390
shot earlier this is where the user of
exploit kid would upload his mouth into

139
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:20,270
the panel and then thats reference on
this so study in this particular block

140
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,470
of code 1 and figure out if there's a
way for me to upload PHP back door to

141
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,720
kind of masquerade as executable by
uploading my own back door then pretty

142
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,950
much have full access to that panel one
of the first checks that this block of

143
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:43,490
code performed is it would die if it was
not an ajax request so this being a

144
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,310
client header very easily to forge not
only from the curl command line but also

145
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:57,029
within lip curled giving any programming
language Perl PHP or Python even second

146
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:01,779
one being blacklisted extensions and
whenever i'm taking a look at PHP code

147
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,329
for portability is a love scene
blacklist because they're very easily

148
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,750
bypassed

149
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:15,060
more well-known our families use some of
its earlier panels that were released

150
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,250
into the wild also utilized a blacklist
which if you're able to grab that

151
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,940
cryptic code of the particular malware
sample you can upload PHP back door

152
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,970
because they utilized a blacklist for
extensions

153
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:39,399
some one of the main issues with doing a
black list is regardless of how you

154
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:46,060
might be able to think of all the ways
that might have PHP execution with the

155
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:52,750
particular ones one of the biggest
problems is not taking into account

156
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:59,740
patchy considers as PHP executed
extensions so so this could block it

157
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,819
didn't take into account that you can
have an uppercase extension for PHP

158
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:10,209
still get a communication error code
execution rather finally a little bit of

159
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:15,939
obfuscation that was implemented step 3
it uploads to hardcoded directory which

160
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:21,029
is that long and a five string which
happens to be there in 25 of uploads so

161
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:27,529
trying to trying to fool or maybe any
type of like directory fuzzing that a

162
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:33,439
particular princess you're my performing
in CSE 20 pretty interesting and finally

163
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:42,019
it remains a file to a bunch of random
digits the extension driving through the

164
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:48,920
coat pocket self for the Ajax check go
too much into this but again just a

165
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,760
simple girl parameters bypasses check

166
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:02,250
here's the actual code block for the
black list itself so whenever I

167
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,220
initially you know get that PHP source
code tossing her reps and wallets turn

168
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:13,550
in burning that you know do a series of
grabs maybe for password or blacklist

169
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:19,020
definitely being one of them so I love
seeing that pop up and my about but and

170
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:25,460
as you can see here is very simple
within the program itself although were

171
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,970
uploading shelled out PHP is actually a
file that resides on disk that's my back

172
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,530
door cell there is a filename perimeter
as you can utilize for that extends

173
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:43,390
finally putting that all together the
fall

174
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:52,790
girl proof of concept for shell upload
400 explica so take a look to folks in

175
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,120
the back and see that my lab environment
I installed it at the path of Hunter UK

176
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,349
da local / UK and then you can see that
MDN 5 string sorts with 512 of the

177
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:10,280
directory that it drops in and then the
code block renamed the file to a bunch

178
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,260
of random to just start PHP

179
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:24,890
and if anyone's interested put together
just a quick PHP code block script for

180
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:32,530
this only for the demo someone as you
though that I came across is that

181
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:37,960
whenever it's dropped into that Andy 5
directory there unfortunately is no

182
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,720
directory browsing because they do have
the index file automatically so you not

183
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,630
gonna know the name of the shell that it
renames that rain and didja to see what

184
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,140
you can do within the PHP script itself
to set up a for loop that pretty much

185
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:02,190
tries the combination decoded this the
randomized function utilizing PHP brand

186
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:09,010
function and although he he specified
the max integer value as nine trillion

187
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:16,000
code itself does not support a maximum
of nine trillion so thats machine

188
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,720
dependent so bear that in mind suzhou I
think my coat dole you know try to go

189
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,060
all the way up to nine trillion but it's
definitely not a multithreaded by any

190
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,980
means so if you're not doing this in a
while but if you do better than mine

191
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:55,940
it's gonna take awhile to find it and
it's any questions so far

192
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:04,870
yes the question is how did they how did
it go without a training

193
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:11,090
exploited itself and as far as I
understand it the actual author of this

194
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,720
exploit kid he would give you full
access to the admin interface panel and

195
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,259
then from there you know you could
upload whatever malware that you wanted

196
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:24,970
to do with an actual leak of the of the
exploit kid there was over twenty

197
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:31,759
samples of our list of all the drivers
for bankers banking charging within that

198
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:58,590
uploads directory here

199
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:07,610
so it just takes two parameters the the
full path of the URL to exploit kit and

200
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:41,139
then the PHP she'll back door that you
want to upload

201
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:49,070
this is just a pretty typical WSO
backdoor PHP show that I've loaded your

202
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:55,960
couple things within the panel itself so
take a look at the code know during my

203
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,880
vulnerability analysis ok so well as the
pen tester you know just broke into this

204
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,980
website by uploading the file how can I
you know fully take over that panel how

205
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,510
do I get access at the panel itself I
could you know about the entire

206
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,790
directory and dump the data base in
locally or a kid you know browser

207
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,750
configuration file see where the sequel
credits are and take a look at the

208
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:28,580
sequel studies in most of the exploit
kits in PHP panels that I analyze the

209
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,980
admin username passwords are stored
within the data base but with this one

210
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:44,210
was actually stored in login PHP here

211
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,930
so this one was although he he

212
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:56,110
MDN 5 he is checking them 25 the
particular values here and i five is

213
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,399
pretty insecure main reason being is
that most of the houses have been

214
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:07,860
cracked I really liked the website has
killer Dakota UK so awesome D five

215
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,040
houses in there and they came out to be
an admin for the username and Hunter for

216
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:21,240
the password so pretty simple to to get
into kid backing up here so we did once

217
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,720
you attach to the sequel data base
that's running back in on this panel

218
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,640
the sequel credit themselves or are
there are also in plain text within the

219
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:45,149
panel was even with you know WordPress
or Joomla

220
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:49,899
tax credits for the Google database
itself so by exporting you know

221
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:56,139
utilizing this arbitrary upload exploit
finding out the credentials for the

222
00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:01,089
sequel we pretty much on this entire
panel now even within this shell it has

223
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:05,918
a sequel client here you can see that I
could attach that a single database even

224
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:18,279
if it was limiting localhost access to
that data base any questions that I have

225
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:30,570
a little bit about again and user
Windows users mitigation patch restart

226
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:37,229
and try to apply when it updates again
or 81 pretty cold so cold that I came

227
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:43,529
across was secure Nia correctly security
at psi what this application does it

228
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:50,759
will check all of the apps that you have
on your computer such as Adobe Java make

229
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,580
sure that it's up to date so it's a
pretty new one I think there's probably

230
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,849
a couple more different applications
that a check for this third-party

231
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:01,519
plug-ins to make sure they're fully
patched

232
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:07,440
limit the the JavaScript execution
within your your browser to so within

233
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,109
chrome you can install script safe and
also within Firefox there's a plugin

234
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:17,099
called no script also might want to
consider disabling flash it is not

235
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:22,700
needed within your environment and other
several you know within your work

236
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,279
environment you might have some
particularly I don't know a jar software

237
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,929
that you might have to run Flash on Jul
had to try to only you as a p.m. for

238
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:38,089
that type of scenario and you can also
disable finds itself in chrome about

239
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:42,879
plugins for Firefox Tools out on the
plugins

240
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:53,090
by the fault now in Firefox thats cool
just wanted to give special thanks to as

241
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,629
well

242
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,410
Brian burns over a proof point again
reached out to him after the published

243
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,840
article is very interested in the book
itself and he's been very helpful in

244
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,409
getting a bunch of data that they
weren't able to share publicly although

245
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:16,460
redacted to say but sharing unless and
big shout out to to Pinterest fallacy

246
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,300
shaking his head but appreciate his help
you know getting here and everything

247
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:26,860
great conference so far and finally the
the research team at fishman thanks for

248
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:50,240
giving me the time off to be here have
any questions or concerns

249
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,450
not most summer more targeted will try
to do some sort of a client pre

250
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:01,780
filtering to figure out you know there's
there's no reason for me as his exploits

251
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:08,678
as soon you gonna bility or an exploit
if you're not running flash not running

252
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:14,870
Joba right and the main reason for that
is within the corporate environment you

253
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:21,909
have ideas or you have posted base ideas
within most antivirus signatures so you

254
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,570
wouldn't wanna do the shotgun effect
because that would give away here the

255
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:32,720
presence of an exploit kit but question
so this since this exploit kit is

256
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,720
definitely no low-end compared to some
of the more widely used and highly

257
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:54,730
developed ones that's the approach that
this particular one uses it also thanks

258
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,080
for having me
