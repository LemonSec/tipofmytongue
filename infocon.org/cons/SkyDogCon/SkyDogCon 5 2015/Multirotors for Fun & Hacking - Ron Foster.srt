1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,920
jurors today is for

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,960
done it had never really for me is more
fun than anything and my wife I think at

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,340
times but you know in general if it goes
and its control by some type of rabbis

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,450
controller these days makes me happy so
I have a daughter we home school and she

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,550
likes him alot too and she told the kids
in the neighborhoods and probably have

6
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,769
to neighbors think were spying on them
and it's it's fantastic but you know

7
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,040
it's it's fun stuffs already talked
about it today the introduction by

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:01:08,070
myself so about me I'm faster or slower
for HP 425 security consultants security

9
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,669
consultant I break things I've been
breaking things for probably 20 years so

10
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,390
we'll get it that I think stuff too but
probably not the same frequency that a

11
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:25,520
break things so that's another reason
you know so little about what is a multi

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,908
rotor we hear a lot in the news and
everywhere else these days about drones

13
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:35,380
and drones kind of an odd he was term
UAV is another way to describe a drone

14
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,960
which is you know something you don't
drive to note on his vehicle so it can

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,369
be autonomous but can also be actually
piloted by humans so generally what we

16
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,049
see even the little toy things of their
calling drones these days are just you

17
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:55,229
know little politic quad copters they're
fantastic they're getting cheaper by the

18
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,399
day and I mean really cheap like I can
get stuff like I have a little baby mini

19
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,899
drone in my bag that I can get shipped
from China for like $12 with a

20
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,649
controller ready to go and make lots of
children happy christmas is just they're

21
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:12,010
fantastic how cheap they're getting so
it's a hobby that's come down a lot in

22
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,000
price and you can really get into it
really expensively now so but for the

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,360
focus of this talk really gonna be
talking about things that are multi

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,340
rotors Hawk drones they could be weaned
aircraft

25
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,610
you know they could be airplanes could
be all kinds of things that could be me

26
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,700
helicopters but helicopters and we have
two to three routers for the purpose of

27
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:43,980
this talk about things that have more
than 2 Reuters

28
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,518
so uses for a UAV drones are multi
raters is quite a few there's military

29
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,129
surveillance which we see in a non
commercial aspect as used by military as

30
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,268
well as for if they stretched missiles
to the bottom line they can be used for

31
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:02,370
a lot more some people would say
nefarious reasons about you know to do

32
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,690
damage they can be used for surveying
its a very popular way right now to use

33
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,930
UAVs and is also a cool way to pay for
your hobby so once you start getting to

34
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,640
the level of the ones that are on the
stage here if you start getting into

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,078
some survey work which you'll have to
actually apply for a license to be legit

36
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,180
then you can she start paying for your
hobby and when she reached that point

37
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,440
then the hobby can start becoming a lot
more exciting as well

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,560
search-and-rescue so we're starting to
see drones be deployed throughout the

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,819
world are multi raters throughout the
road in search and rescue operations

40
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,950
videography and the buzz words these
days

41
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,910
Internet of Things these things can be
connected to the internet now and I

42
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,220
think the sky's the limit and some of
the stuff that will be able to see these

43
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,959
things do you will love the day when I
can pull out my drawn from my house over

44
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,599
the Internet

45
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,518
sweet beautiful thing I think that he's
in the point and then of course this is

46
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,510
a single hacking conference mean really
there's nothing better in the strapping

47
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,849
a Raspberry Pi of the bottom of thing
running a full Cali Linux instance and

48
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,690
were driving your neighborhood that's
the most beautiful thing that you can do

49
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:12,950
with a multi rotor so types of
moderators there's multiple

50
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,579
configurations few here on this slide
you know from a figuration standpoint we

51
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,860
have caught both writers such as this
one and generally when you build these

52
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,970
things you can do to your actions

53
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,970
whereas the two front-runners this is
forward this is back or any plus

54
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,340
configuration where this is forward and
this is back and those are the two major

55
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,479
configurations at least for this and
you'll see on the board here there's a

56
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,990
multiple types of configurations from
three rotorcraft all the way up to och

57
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,120
248 rotorcraft

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:58,010
demonstrating once again the typical
quadrotor configurations as we see

59
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:08,360
around the world so basic parts and
components of a multi rotor we have the

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,720
frame of the multi rotor and this can be
anything from dowel rods and a toolbox

61
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,410
you just want to create an ex I mean so
you can literally filled it out of

62
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,330
anything

63
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,000
es ease which are as electronic speed
controllers

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,750
little regulators that regulate the
voltage from the battery to the motor or

65
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,330
from the controller to the motor power
distribution which is using some type of

66
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,650
harness were soldered board which allows
the power from the battery to be

67
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,989
distributed to all the components the
controller itself telemetry which allows

68
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,289
us to track her and then your receivers
and transmitters how many people here

69
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:51,610
ever play with toys or anything any
hobbyist here at all and it was one guy

70
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,530
talk to you that a little bit about
APM's the hobby is getting cheaper about

71
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,549
the day how you heard of a phantom a
real popular model I'm not a a DJI

72
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,440
phantom kinda guy I'll talk about that
later on why but you know there is a

73
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,990
very popular model multi rotor right now
so the heart of your you're good you're

74
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,410
a multi runners gonna be the controller
this is probably where you have the

75
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:23,280
potential to spend the most amount of
money on your multi rotor on the cheap

76
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,919
is the KK too and it's a fantastic
little bored and has a built-in LCD on

77
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,299
it you can program it directly from the
board by getting a little dip switches

78
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,370
and ups and downs and the boards like
$35 so the entire brains for your your

79
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,380
multi rotor 35 bucks and you can program
right there on the board they're

80
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,490
fantastic and they're also the downsides
of KKTV don't get fancy stuff like GPS

81
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,750
and things of that nature

82
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,870
same thing with like the multi weeds

83
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,990
which is another really inexpensive
board see 3d is a popular more as well

84
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,630
as not so Nasim we think about the
Phantoms the noises are made by the same

85
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,159
company they're called DJI I don't like
NAS controllers for the same reason I

86
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,780
don't like phantom moderators and the
reason that is is we are hackers I don't

87
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,630
like being told what I can and cannot do
with my hardware and there was little

88
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,110
incident a while back you probably heard
in the news where someone flew there

89
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,510
quadcopter onto the white house lawn you
ever hear about that well there's lots

90
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,510
of people out there that wants to make
things hard on us and that individual

91
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,240
after that happen come to find out it
was a phantom so immediately DJI said

92
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,170
from now on all firmware going forward
will be pushing no-fly zones directly to

93
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,840
our firmware so if you're multi raters
anywhere near a no-fly zone can even

94
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,580
take off I understand you know the
reason for doing that but I don't like

95
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,300
not having strong hardware so for that
reason I'm not another fan so that

96
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,150
brings us to a PM's APM's are a little
bit awards are mostly Adreno boards

97
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,849
they're running a stripped down version
of Linux and they're fantastic they

98
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,090
usually give you all the functionality
of another controller they're not that

99
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,719
difficult to program and they're
fantastic for GPS they have built-in

100
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,290
digital compasses and have built in you
know barometric pressure sensors and get

101
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:19,800
altitude there and there you can get a
218 225 on Amazon right now with the GPS

102
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,020
module all the components necessary from
least market or standpoint for about $65

103
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:33,169
so we're not talking a lot of money to
get started there

104
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,468
so we talk about receivers and
transmitters is another area we can

105
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,779
spend a whole lot of money once again
I'm a friend of the open source so I run

106
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:47,100
a Turnigy Turnigy has open source
firmware it's how they maintained by the

107
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,699
community and there's talks to you which
you know I don't know if that's a

108
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:54,599
feature not but you know it will let you
know when things are not kosher

109
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,230
sometimes let you know batteries are
running low if you haven't figured that

110
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,720
way we are starting to have electrical
faults in your motors its does a lot of

111
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,510
cool stuff and other cool controller
it's very similar that is the the frost

112
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,420
gotta rains controller but it's about
double the money that's receiver and

113
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:17,680
transmitter together only $100 and the
cool thing about it is like me you're

114
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,540
running multiple multi raters

115
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,849
just as a model on the back so you can
just pop this out and you can pop in

116
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,699
your next transceiver receiver or
whatever then you're flying and you have

117
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:32,130
a multi-use controller for almost
anything you're flying or whatever

118
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,220
you're using out there even if you want
to drive their cars with boats or

119
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:43,779
whatever then there's a really expensive
stuff I know guys it spent $1000 on

120
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:48,670
transmitter receivers and those are
people that have no kids and and lots of

121
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:54,019
disposable income which I have neither
one of those kids in lots of income that

122
00:09:54,019 --> 00:10:00,019
leaves my hands before even know how to
PHX oh no those work for me on top of

123
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,690
the receiver isn't imagery barometric
pressure sensors are very important

124
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,519
because we would be able to tell the
altitude of things things fly out so

125
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,459
we're thinking about using a board we
want to make sure that it has that built

126
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,250
into the board and most of the boards
today it's the Super Keyboard like the

127
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,040
the multi wheeze in the KK boards they
have that built into them and the last

128
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
thing is GPS GPS is fantastic and I'll
show you some software then the

129
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,870
presentation that I use called Mission
Planner with a quadrotor here with a big

130
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,260
stick sticking out of the top of you see
that but i holed up in a minute that's

131
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,029
the GPS module for this unit and the
cool thing about it is I have my radio

132
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,550
transmitter setup so I just flip a
switch and then my laptop drives by

133
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,019
multi rotor I can tell it

134
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:47,050
GPS coordinates and want to fly to what
altitude and flip a switch and I'll come

135
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,790
back in the land itself I don't fly at
all so it's a really good way to work

136
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,689
driver neighborhood and also violates
lot of FAA guidelines and we'll talk

137
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:55,319
about that

138
00:10:55,319 --> 00:11:03,019
towards the presentations will so
another reason to have these things is

139
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:07,759
payload I mean we want to be able to
lift stuff and then people the backrest

140
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,059
me how many pounds in these lifts and
unfortunately even with the size of

141
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:17,699
these were talking grams not pounds most
people heard of the GoPro have lost a

142
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:21,389
few go pros in my heart sinks when I
lose a GoPro on a multi rotor flying

143
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:27,379
over Lake gut-wrenching things begin to
happen as you watch it sink so which

144
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:31,739
these cheap Chinese knockoffs they are
pretty much go pro quality and their

145
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:36,329
hundred bucks if you lose it or not
crying some of my favorite camera and

146
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:43,128
actually this guy here it's super light
it's made by company and its a hacker's

147
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:47,309
dream camera it's under $100 they sell
extension cables for it so you can

148
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:52,350
remove the lands and put the Lions
wherever you want it they sell capacitor

149
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,049
kids you can remove the battery and run
it again to 10,000 million battery ran

150
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,779
the sites like six days you know let it
be looping through building files on

151
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:03,600
your card makes a fantastic camera for
you know we're driving down the road if

152
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,949
you want to have set up a dash cam he
says it's a fantastic camera they sell

153
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:11,719
multiple lenses for it and you can
literally by the $30 runners this big

154
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,220
offline take some rubber bands at a
piece of foam strapped to the bottom and

155
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,639
get very good video I mean really cool
the camera highly recommend it

156
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,199
hacker pilots so we mention the
raspberry PI's I utilized in very very

157
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,329
heavy because they run Cali so will the
cali version to you which came out a few

158
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:34,169
months ago DEFCON they had the image out
almost immediately for the Raspberry Pi

159
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:37,889
is seeking love this thing up once again
took a small three thousand million

160
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:40,949
battery up to it and you've got
literally an hour and a half of that

161
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:44,479
thing running and you can drive a
neighborhood with it and if you want to

162
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,860
be a little creative program you can
also

163
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,180
Google API action and you know have some
fun for logging GPS coordinates build

164
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,069
little maps here neighborhood and post
it to your neighborhood community groups

165
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,150
and then make your neighbors even more
paranoid about you but I another really

166
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,569
fine I don't have a star works you know
fireworks are fantastic distraction

167
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,920
would you rather I mean we've probably
seen the video of if you haven't you go

168
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,760
to get out of someone's driving roman
candles to the to the skids of their

169
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,819
multi rotor and lighting them up and
sending it down and chasing their friend

170
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,890
which you know we tried that it's
fantastic he really is you know and you

171
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,330
don't want the little betrayed the
little ones first they're no good you

172
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,470
want the big roman candles in a lift
them and it's good and then you know

173
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,840
whatever else you can imagine we've seen
the videos online if the guy manning the

174
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,060
gun on his if you haven't seen as
another one that's from a little heavy I

175
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,709
would think a nice quality airsoft gas
powered would be just as fun and

176
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:47,160
functional also you know people actually
can't go wrong with that either both of

177
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,300
those are less harmful and you know
you're probably a lot more special that

178
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,979
that kid who lives down the road from me
anyway as we move forward we talked a

179
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,780
little about the camera hey let's go
prose that little Chinese knockoff

180
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:06,540
cameras caught in SGA can if you want to
look that up on a hundred books like

181
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,030
your pillows we talked about the
raspberry PI's billboards are really

182
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,550
good and I know about you but everything
in my inbox Kickstarter fan I'm always

183
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,599
contributing to Kickstarter projects
because I just love all the little

184
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,960
things and now they have the new little
bored that's this big supposed to be a

185
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,100
complete Linux distribution with WiFi
everything built onto aboard the size of

186
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,750
a quarter I can imagine the things that
I'll be able to do things you know as

187
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,250
he's low projects to happen there so
many things that will be able to do with

188
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,160
these and once again I don't he's
becoming such a big buzzword so that's

189
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,110
one thing that I'm focusing at least at
home with my daughter home school my

190
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,490
daughter and we're always coming up with
a project that we can kind of figure out

191
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,720
to hack and destroy things and you know
that's going to be our next project we

192
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,800
just got in

193
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,990
house now we have the big problem that's
the legal aspect so if you're gonna be

194
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,060
with a drone fire one of the first
things going to find out as you can't

195
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,630
fly them in a lot of places one of my
first outings was over at the farmers

196
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,519
market in the damage downtown Nashville
they had that big filled out there in

197
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,170
the park out there by the mall and we
were out there one day a little bitty

198
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,310
multi writers we like three of them in
my daughter and we were just teheran

199
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,930
there is no one out there we were buzzin
things left and right now I see you know

200
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,569
the guy comes you know he's got a
firearm and only bad thing is like you

201
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,700
can't do that here really like yes you
can't do that this was a few years ago

202
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:39,870
and this is what I was new doing it home
and I research with respect to pack

203
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:45,730
everything and he was absolutely correct
and the reason is correct is the laws

204
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,339
that were built were built at the time
when there was gas powered motors in

205
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,740
almost all those the flying things out
there they were very loud really loud

206
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,680
and most of the stuff that I've read it
really help deal with noise ordinances

207
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,870
in anything so I think those laws need
to be changed but unfortunately people

208
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,829
keep doing stupid stuff I don't see that
happening anytime soon but if you want

209
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:10,649
to find out what the rules or this is
the website you wanna go to use the FAA

210
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,290
website and they have a model aircraft
section and they had everything broken

211
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,480
out as far as the rules of what you can
count on to your multi rotor intense the

212
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,810
epic we have eight airfields or you can
go join clubs you fly wherever I found

213
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,510
churches to be awesome as well a lot of
churches have large parking lots they

214
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:37,529
have large fields alot of them so
they're very kind

215
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:45,779
snapshot of the basic rules and one of
the first major rules that they put out

216
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,209
these rules came out in January so in
January towards the end of the year last

217
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,849
year they start talking about the rules
are gonna come into play in regards to

218
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,430
fly multi raters and when they hit I'm
really good at that time he said they're

219
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,269
going to make its actually apply for a
pilot's license that was what they said

220
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,939
we were going to be doing you're going
to have to play it wasn't like a legit

221
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,620
pilot's license but basically a license
saying that you know the basics when

222
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:13,089
you're not stupid and unfortunately they
may need to go to that because a lot of

223
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:16,129
stupid people flying drones and we'll
talk about that in the last couple

224
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,010
slices but the first rule is to fly
below for nursing remain clear

225
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,158
surrounding obstacles you go to the news
every day and read about some person

226
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:28,120
flying drone into a building into people
and all these types of things so this

227
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,889
rule is obviously be ignored and I doubt
enforcements any better and that's the

228
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:38,140
biggest problem with all these rules
enforcement keep aircraft within Visual

229
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,870
line of sight of all times with that
kind of defeats the purpose of having a

230
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:46,549
GPS multi rotor that you can fly their
neighborhood programs in not see it so

231
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:50,289
you can just tell to do its thing so
personally were probably already

232
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:54,570
violating the law of her playing with
GPS piano type things recordings because

233
00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:01,549
we're doing any type of way point
tracking the rules also remain will

234
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:06,600
clear up and do not interfere with
Amanda aircraft operations you know I

235
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,600
can't imagine I'm sure like this one
will go four thousand feet but literally

236
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,330
seen airplane pilot and commercial yes
we're four thousand feet just got buzzed

237
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:22,199
that's that's not good stuff and all it
could be sucked into a motor it can

238
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,500
actually do damage to the aircraft
there's a lot of risks there and you

239
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,860
know the rules are there for a reason

240
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,729
no-fly within five miles from the
airport and I'm going to read the rest

241
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:42,730
of that contact just come fly with me
and also on our people our stadiums or

242
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,590
places where people are overly paranoid
period that's just a great way to do it

243
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,149
or you'll get your aircraft shot a guy
like the

244
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:59,089
few months ago with a guy comes out of
the shotgun so just be careful and don't

245
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:03,700
fly an aircraft weighs 155 pounds and
let me tell you this right now 55 pounds

246
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,210
is a lot of multi rotor all these
because weight is such a consideration

247
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,979
when you're building these things you're
gonna find the motors have a thrust

248
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:14,999
rating on them so what you want to do is
you want to kind of get all the

249
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:19,059
components outside of your motors put
him on a scale including your cameras

250
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,799
GoPro whatever and figure out what those
are going to play and in factor in how

251
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,989
much the motors way themselves and then
when you buy your motors dual motors

252
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:31,469
need to be double the thrust of the
weight so they'll say this voters rated

253
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:36,359
for 300 grams but I mean if you have a
six hundred grand copter that's that's

254
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:41,849
not enough motor 450 copier the Grand
motor you're gonna go so that's how much

255
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,119
thrust you want of course that's gonna
be spread across multiple runners are

256
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,968
some math it has to be done in in my
tenure massive that's another reason to

257
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:53,200
tell her that if you want to fly build
these things you have to learn math so

258
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,320
there is a reason for it and don't be
careless reckless with your unmanned

259
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,539
aircraft just want you to know I just go
to YouTube that would be great for the

260
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,830
U-two party just find careless

261
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:14,080
videos so then we have Monday and
apparently the MacBook Pro is meant to

262
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:21,539
the screensaver then so so as of Monday
though we gotta a rationing thing was

263
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:25,169
also my email box and it said the
government has now decided once again

264
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:30,589
they want to register drones and this is
for every room this means if your kid go

265
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:35,519
to Toys R Us and buys a $20 little
helicopter the government wants you to

266
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,919
register it as per the rules that
they're speaking of now but as also is

267
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,940
typical with the government when they
announced that they said well we're

268
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,479
hoping to support this with it

269
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:48,779
set this up within two months we really
have no idea how we're gonna do this we

270
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,409
have no idea how we're going to enforce
its we just never going to charge you

271
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:55,660
money to register your craft and that's
kind of the way we're gonna do

272
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:05,700
and the whole purpose of course is to
track who does would and this is why we

273
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,550
can't have nice things so as we do have
people flying restricted airspace is we

274
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:14,860
do have people flying aircraft when you
have people flying near airports and we

275
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,439
do have people interfering with rescue
emergency efforts recently there was a

276
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,930
story where there was a large force fire
they have these very large tanker

277
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,660
aircraft I think they said it costs
roughly $10,000 per load to get those

278
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,620
craft in the air loaded down with a fire
at targets and there was all these

279
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,030
modest multi runners in the way of the
craft so they've crafted to turn around

280
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,129
and go man because he didn't want to
risk damage to the craft because of the

281
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,280
most e-readers they track down the
owners of those and they're charging

282
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:48,129
them for the cost of that thing being in
the air and the cost of the fire started

283
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,840
late so basically $10,000 things being
distributed between two different

284
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,909
crashed so let's just be responsible I
mean that's a big problem with the multi

285
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,040
rotor community is that there's people
like me who want to be conscious really

286
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,080
don't want your neighbors all the stuff
I'm saying is in jest but in the real

287
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,720
world

288
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,100
be very conscious of what you're doing
and we're doing don't interfere with

289
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,949
emergency personnel don't do things are
going to irritate people and definitely

290
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,260
don't be trying to take pictures of that
girl on top of the building was sunning

291
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,620
herself that's just another way to get
your thing shot out of the sky so so

292
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,639
this time was talking about building
then we talked about some of the

293
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,130
components let's talk about costs and
all those six writer that I have here

294
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:40,680
this is running a multi-week controller
and this will cost about ten minutes on

295
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,490
this matter which means you have to come
with lots of batteries or get bigger

296
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,580
batteries and all in all it costs in
this when I think I have maybe for to

297
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:56,179
$5,500 so this is not really expensive
project anymore but if this seems

298
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,630
daunting that you're going to build this
I have another option for you and that

299
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,080
is called the cheers in Ch 29 a couple
of things and I've destroyed probably

300
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,299
one of them really bad

301
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,279
but if you're a beginner drones are
beginning to multi writers and you want

302
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,129
to learn how to fly this is basically a
clone of the Phantom line and is running

303
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:19,428
on Linux 8 p.m. controller see you can
use it with Mission Planner you can

304
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:24,869
program it has full GPS functionality
and it's under $250 shipped with a

305
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:29,488
controller ready to fly to the us- and
that to me is insane

306
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:33,549
these things cost just five years ago

307
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:44,070
shearson CX 2400 parts well hobbyking is
a very popular website to do that from

308
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:51,428
bank good Bangladesh to the site that
has the CX 2400 250 also support your

309
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,749
local hobby stores that's a big thing we
don't have very many of them left in

310
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:59,429
nashville go there by your components
break your stuff go back to bed for

311
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:03,200
parts you know it's really get involved
with your local people there and have

312
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,869
some fun just like this is local
community frequency local community we

313
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:10,970
got lots of local communities here
that's another community involvement in

314
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:18,390
really have some fun

315
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:24,040
so the barbers has been once again if
it's too daunting than the above option

316
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,320
is probably fantastic for the CH 20 as
of this morning was under $250 a check

317
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,830
it right before I came in it is an
open-source copter is running a

318
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:39,179
stripped-down Linux and the beautiful
part of it is telemetry this little

319
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,200
model years it'll imagery module that I
have on this one this is running an APM

320
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,390
this year 2009 AP so it's the same type
of controller

321
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:55,450
these shearson doesn't have the headers
for the telemetry module so you will

322
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,190
have to break out there are tons of
tutorials on the internet for it it's

323
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,880
not nothing it's three little sore
points so we're not talking you know a

324
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,500
whole lot of stuff you're if you're not
good at all during its ok its ugly just

325
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,980
bring lots of bandaids

326
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,220
you're gonna burn yourself you'll be
fine but once you do that then you can

327
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,770
grow to the next stage which is
controlling aircraft from your laptop so

328
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:28,290
this is a software that you use with
most APM's Commission Potter and the

329
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,780
beautiful thing about mission planners
you just look at your craft via USB or

330
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,490
if you have to limit reset up and
configured to communicate your craft up

331
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,870
to five miles

332
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:43,449
directly over 20 basically creates a 15
K pod connection over radio frequency so

333
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,680
fast enough to do almost anything you
need to do and the other great thing

334
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,690
about it is if you lose your crash
traffic is down you can I got an idea

335
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,990
the last part where it was before wind
down so you have a much better chance of

336
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,330
retrieving it in the early days of
flying larger aircraft I learned very

337
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,159
quickly you can lose them and if you
don't put your name on them they're gone

338
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,160
forever so another thing is you're gonna
be flying these things especially

339
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,520
residential areas

340
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,600
put your name on you know you want to
reopen a reward you know $2 whatever I

341
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,429
mean just don't see what the reward is
just say you'll you'll pay a reward you

342
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,680
know if you'll bring me back my craft

343
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,240
know and hopefully you'll you'll get
there retrieved but the beauty of this

344
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,550
software is little you can simulate the
software industry you know what's going

345
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:34,540
on here

346
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:55,889
italy has a virtual table controls and
see what the software is telling the

347
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,980
controller to do without ever leaving
your kitchen without actually flying she

348
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,940
can really tuned for multi rotor just
with Mission Planner software you can

349
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,730
also play with a lot of other cool stuff
like setting virtual boundary fences in

350
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,020
things that nature what you can do with
a 626 they never leave within a template

351
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:19,430
so will never fly it will be very good
said never fly above a specific

352
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,500
altitudes you don't fly above
seventy-five feet there's a lot of

353
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,170
customization you can do the software
update the firmware multi rotor and it's

354
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:31,870
fantastic once again under $250 for all
that capability and it's really good

355
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:44,919
stuff but that's pretty much my daughter
is your questions

356
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,710
it will have to go pro no prob at all
actually comes for free with a basic

357
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,830
GoPro out they sell a very good to
access functioning gamble for around

358
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:58,409
$100 that is powered so you will get a
full working gamble so you get very

359
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:04,800
stable video video up on YouTube of me
taking the gamble on Ch 21 UTI just text

360
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,970
tech so you can look for my channel to
be ek Tek you can find that video and

361
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:12,490
you'll see me actually from a controller
just twisting snobs in the Kimball

362
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:18,540
rotating the camera on its axis lives as
I was tuning it up getting ready for

363
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,210
flight

364
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:36,410
other questions you sir

365
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:51,170
yes that could be something as simple as
your props on being balanced I mean it's

366
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:55,880
it's they make a little problem for $20
you can take these guys put them on

367
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,260
there and spend them see where the ball
is simple piece of tape on it to you get

368
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:06,020
them balanced it could be lots of things
in three years yes things have changed I

369
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,620
tell people if they have never built
before we start with something like a CH

370
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:17,239
20 and the beauty of it is because it is
literally is this it really is it's all

371
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,170
the components here separate accept a
lot of its near sauntered into PCBs

372
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,970
whatever but for that reason you get all
the functionality of this in a $250

373
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,930
units are you been built for you you can
literally just tear them apart with the

374
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,720
shell off and there's all the components
or USB cables up which there is actually

375
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,080
on that model a port on the bottom ready
for you as well as the pinouts for

376
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,820
campbell's but know if you still have it
and you know it controller used to mean

377
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,780
you're welcome to paying me maybe I can
help you get it off the ground

378
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,370
yeah we're always doing that this guy
here to me like three days to figure out

379
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,120
where to balance the landing skids cause
if they were a little bit here are

380
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,510
horrid wanted it one way or the other so
either had to put weights on one side to

381
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:04,120
balance it but then if you had cameras
to it so that's because this guy is not

382
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,870
running in a p.m. with a PMI can be
going to the parameters and say this

383
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:13,020
motor automatically compensate and give
a little bit more thrust so would never

384
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,260
have to do that I can balance everything
and software just with the motors so

385
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,400
that's why the controllers mean a lot
and I'm a huge fan of the APM's the

386
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,290
newer ones I guess it's pick stocks
they're they're more expensive but they

387
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,260
are the latest tech these are now
considered the deprecated module models

388
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,410
and you bomb the game we won't give you
new firmware the lady she can get is

389
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,500
this I'm fine with that because they're
rock solid and the beauty of these is

390
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,310
that when you look at your computer the
first time it basically says what do you

391
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:45,149
want to build on it this build a car
boat or helicopter a multi rotor

392
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,260
that rock opera quad copter copter

393
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,990
and it pushes custom firmware to the
device and literally from there you just

394
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,620
week everything and tons of online
support because it's an open source

395
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:03,300
product for tons of forms out there are
lots of large community of the questions

396
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:09,310
you know I could possibly bring back
tomorrow

397
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,300
wasn't planning on doing today but
tomorrow on in my daughter went to come

398
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,960
with some smaller units just to annoy
people shit and should therefore we have

399
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:29,250
this

400
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,010
as it was Monday that was announced
they're saying it's going to be two

401
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,910
months for the even come up with a way
that even gonna work from a rule

402
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:42,900
standpoint I say you're probably in CEE
true implementation is for problem in

403
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,100
your next year and even then it's going
to come down once again if every kid

404
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,409
goes to Toys R Us issue and buys a
little toy multi rotor how are they

405
00:31:50,410 --> 00:32:01,970
going to force that yeah of course cuz
capitalism's awesome fantastic but I but

406
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:07,050
it but in the real world i mean
enforcement gonna be an issue and you

407
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,930
know they did this before they said in
the beginning there and I had you apply

408
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:16,630
for a pilot's license and register they
backed off on it then they said just put

409
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,880
the basic rules out and I was saying you
gotta register again let's let everyone

410
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,490
still on this for a couple of months
we're trying to figure it out and see

411
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:34,610
where it lands because I don't think
it's realistic yes sir no

412
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:43,840
I personally so properties people who
say yes these are my property boundaries

413
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,610
were doing things like that and I'm just
in the early stages that but you know

414
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,159
there's a lot of room for monetization
actually I think the biggest area if you

415
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,150
really want to get on the ground floor
of this is actually become an instructor

416
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,250
to teach classes for the commercial is
funny because when they first started

417
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:07,260
talking about how you cannot shoot in
the early phases of a licensing or the

418
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,720
legal thing he said you cannot fly
commercially so what people were doing

419
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,490
is saying

420
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,030
video commercially so what some of my
friends do this is that you know what

421
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,580
we're not charging for video anymore

422
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:27,230
charging for entity so I mean there's
always a way around you know you know

423
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:32,929
all those types of rules that area but
yes on station is fantastic i'm just

424
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:37,240
starting but yeah there's a lot of room
for it when you make it pay for itself

425
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:44,419
becomes more than a hobby and other
questions

426
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:53,119
and cost way more cuz I built it from a
cost perspective the motors are much

427
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:57,840
higher quality I have an aluminum frame
instead of a plastic body when she

428
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,249
crashed 620 a few times make sure you
have lots of spare parts when you order

429
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:09,339
in order spare parts ordered extra keeps
kids pool noodles are your friend you'll

430
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:13,668
find that a lot of my things at home I
used pool noodles on the skids it's just

431
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:22,270
that extra bit of cushion for coming
down I love pool noodles but quality but

432
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:29,030
it's exactly the same it's a little
bigger 620 probably gonna from a radius

433
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:35,730
standpoint gonna cut off about right
here it's considered a 450 457 metres or

434
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:50,280
so if that yes sir

435
00:34:50,280 --> 00:35:01,180
extremely stable crafts they have a GPS
hold function was basically you say this

436
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,440
where you're at I get it up to 50 feet
over my house flip the switch and it

437
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,340
will hold in that position for you
completely stable you can literally

438
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,610
bringing up to your high says a person
but the GPS hold on walk up and push it

439
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:19,280
and it will come right back to that
position now from a landing standpoint

440
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,710
not quite so when you say Come Home Tour
your original GPS coordinates where

441
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:29,370
it'll get within about three feet to
give yourself about a 64 radius you know

442
00:35:29,370 --> 00:36:04,270
so it's pretty close but getting better
336 yes come see me at this point and

443
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:10,560
it's funny because the lighter than the
fiberglass reinforced plastic and and

444
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,250
this one has 11 inch props on it and
this thing actually a pretty serious

445
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,650
let's empower so I can lead to go pro
and two full size batteries running in

446
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:25,490
tandem to give me about 20 minutes of
light

447
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:40,549
talk good question Siena sometime back
as I prepared for their mental
