1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,869
thanks sir thanks for staying for this
one

2
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:24,260
yeah so kick it off you're just want to
talk a little bit about how I came to

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,910
him for SAC come from a military
background law enforcement when the

4
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,690
British Home Office asked to notice
survey to a bunch of information

5
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,680
security professionals about cyber crime
in about how are measuring cybercrime I

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,430
said you know kind of in typical fashion
were doing it all wrong and this

7
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,260
presentation that you're going to see is
really about my initial answers to that

8
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,379
survey and then Dave's fantastic
research that we have a way people

9
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:00,760
actually that's not going to be
published in at PAX which is a journal

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:07,550
so my background in this is I would say
you know before it was cool to talk

11
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,060
about advanced persistent threat but I
was the project manager for something

12
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,820
called to Canadian Museum of human
rights it's not an ion cannon to defend

13
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,419
against the Empire should they arrived
Winnipeg Manitoba Canada but this is

14
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,860
Human Rights Museum that is going to be
a repository for a lot of different

15
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:34,490
stuff that some nations really don't
like so the threat for us was was really

16
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,789
real and I spent a great deal of time
with the architects with the systems

17
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,170
guys in the security guys building
what's the equivalent of cyber mousetrap

18
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,580
to actually find infiltration and you
know we're using some technology a lot

19
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,690
of the AM technology but a lot of it is
a single use disposable vamps 44

20
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:01,600
transactions what am i doing now I'm the
security lead for a company called logic

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,039
now they make a software product to
monitor infrastructure and because every

22
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,550
I T guy needs exit strategy else around
a consulting firm on the side back in

23
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:17,530
Winnipeg Manitoba Canada as well so this
is kind of what it feels a little bit

24
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,690
like to be in the information security
industry the gas right from Zoolander we

25
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,840
laughed because we know what's gonna
happen we know what the outcome of this

26
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,190
is gonna be and unfortunately we're
finding ourselves

27
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,090
more in that space in that headspace
where everything's gonna explode and

28
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,320
unfortunately as the information
security guy when it explodes you lose

29
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,970
your job so this presentation is really
going to be about maybe taking a

30
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,750
different look at the docs taking a
different look at advanced persistent

31
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,280
threat and talking a little bit about
what this new sort of existence that

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,470
we're trying to live in

33
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,550
there's a number of books that I like to
talk about throat this some really great

34
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,390
reading you probably most of people here
probably read these books but they do

35
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,049
really some of the central themes that
we're going to be dealing with as we

36
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,500
move forward that surround privacy and
advanced persistent threat attacks and

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,930
organized crime in the evolution of all
of those type of things together one of

38
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:24,240
the central issues with I'm gonna stay
information security is it ends up being

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,020
perceived as much harder than it is and
we have a lot of anger last night

40
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,830
sitting around having some drinks with
some folks are expressing how difficult

41
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,540
it is to be an information security and
how frustrating it is unfortunately one

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,700
of her major attacks sometimes the users
and what we have to understand is that

43
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,750
the users are like babes in the woods ok
and information security people are the

44
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,510
are the people trying to prevent your
users as hard as we can from hurting

45
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,959
themselves and that's really the
philosophy we need to have and you know

46
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,019
there's this great quote that flew
around the UK healthcare system

47
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:05,170
the medical system would be perfect if
it wasn't for the patients right so this

48
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,600
is sort of the same philosophy that we
have to look at and one of the other

49
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,220
issues and the whole idea behind this
meaningful measurement that I want to

50
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,540
get across to you is that we are not
helped by this industry that feeds off

51
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:23,110
failure that really actually tries to
make a fairly easy to understand subject

52
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,980
complex what do I mean by that it means
that our attacks that we're seeing are

53
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,900
really coming from only four sources ok
they're coming from the email they're

54
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,969
coming from the web

55
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,430
insider mistakes or malicious activity
and over the wire and that's it but

56
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,320
what's even more complicated than that

57
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,750
that is when we look at 93.9% overt acts
are really about email or web that's it

58
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,300
everything else is almost zilch so when
we look at our defenses and we're trying

59
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,440
to defend the four against everything
we're failing to realize that I think

60
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,210
there's to attack vectors that really
need our attention and what's really

61
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,719
frustrating that doesn't get a lot of
publication and it doesn't get talked

62
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,680
about is the same exploits are used are
being used over and over and over again

63
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,310
so in 2014 99.9% of the actual exploited
vulnerabilities were actually disclosed

64
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,030
and given a CVV number and that very
last point is really the one that I'm

65
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,820
trying to get across and unfortunately
the media doesn't really like to talk

66
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,860
about this but the reality is a 99.9% of
your cyber incidents involve known and

67
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,850
often patched a possible software
vulnerabilities so what does that leave

68
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,440
us it leaves us with your action plan ok
this Adobe Flash issue is one that has

69
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,190
galvanized the information security
community and it's essentially comes

70
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,960
down to this every single exploit kit
that is out there is using Adobe Flash

71
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,780
attacks either zero day ok or for
unmatched Adobe Flash so here's the

72
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,380
thing you have a hundred percent chance
of not getting infected by Adobe Flash

73
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,670
exploits if you uninstall Adobe Flash
software the takeaways and unfortunately

74
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,860
what happens to us the media makes us
feel like deaths the media makes us feel

75
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,180
like we're the guys up on the on the
ramparts here trying to prevent us from

76
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,510
climbing in ok and how do I know this
because cyber insurance companies decide

77
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,469
to use the same imagery in their
propaganda and this is one of the things

78
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,400
that cyber insurance companies and are
working at cross purposes

79
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,270
we've all heard the term four hundred
and fifty billion dollars per year is

80
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:55,159
lost through three cybercrime worldwide
well in 2011 there is a study that said

81
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,750
there's eat

82
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,670
trillion dollars being made that was
2011 I haven't found a report the talks

83
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:07,140
with the whole net worth of the online
industry is today this was 2011 a

84
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,219
trillion dollars in the g8 countries so
you can imagine so when we hear this

85
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,460
alarmist turn like four hundred and
fifty billion dollars ok and we're going

86
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,960
to hear when I deconstruct a few of
these attacks were gonna hear some big

87
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,620
numbers but in the grand scheme of
things

88
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,419
four hundred and fifty billion dollars
on eight trillion is actually a really

89
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,870
small amount and it doesn't help

90
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:44,220
go ahead so that's a that's a sidebar
discussion we're going to talk about

91
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,160
that I have a slide on this that is
gonna blow your mind on that on that

92
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,510
topic so here we have our sa big company
right telling us that we all suck and

93
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:01,430
this came from the RSA Conference ok but
then there's this little company that

94
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,870
did this study that showed that 97% of
all your critical vulnerabilities

95
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,840
documented could have been mitigated by
the removal administrative rights where

96
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,820
was the parade on that one

97
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,180
ok where was the keynote speech that
said hey guys if you just remove

98
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,570
administrative rights 99.5% your
vulnerabilities affecting Internet

99
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:29,550
Explorer would be mitigated so this is
what my problem is right now because we

100
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,620
look at these numbers and we say things
like real estate huge growth in security

101
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,460
where you see the billion dollar
industry balloon really see sixty

102
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,310
percent of all targeted attacks touch
small and medium organizations NEC these

103
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,000
statistics I'm not the nine
organizations get attacked but when you

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,320
contrast that right when you contrast
that with one easy step so far are which

105
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,000
is removed / remove administrative
rights it seems to me that that's the

106
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,930
story so my copy puts out this new study
and they show what the value of this

107
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,949
purloined

108
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,510
purloined personally identifiable
information is ok and they've broken it

109
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,280
down by pricing and a broken it down by
you know what you're getting for your

110
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,620
dollars and for your investments
unfortunately this is used now to

111
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,020
determine how much you pay for cyber
insurance and for security products

112
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,480
based on how much of this data you might
have in your repository so this again is

113
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,350
one of these situations where you have a
company that is invested in selling

114
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,180
security solutions

115
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:50,150
coming up with numbers to help them sell
more security solutions I say this as a

116
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:56,880
really interesting report that came over
from Websense which said in 2014 99.3%

117
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,150
and malicious files used in commanding
control you or else had been used by one

118
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,250
or more goals

119
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,670
98.2% of malware authors used commanding
control found in five other types of Mo

120
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,370
ok I wonder what product they're making
right to be something to prevent

121
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,160
commanding control to ya so this is one
of the biggest problems that we have as

122
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,140
we have an industry feeding on itself

123
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,340
ok and I'm gonna give you a few examples
of it more importantly masses heart ok

124
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,990
one of the problems that we have our
whole bunch of different studies that

125
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,020
come out that talk about the value of
that storm on record

126
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:44,370
just like the McCarthy report that I had
earlier ok what those reports don't take

127
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,430
into consideration is things like class
action lawsuits that all of a sudden the

128
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,180
court says yup you have a class action
lawsuit neiman-marcus we don't even know

129
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,620
how much money that's going to cost you
yet but we're talking tens of millions

130
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,000
of dollars that's not factored into the
cost of the stolen record at this point

131
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,510
so you have these hidden costs right
then you have the cost of the breach

132
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,420
itself you got the cost of the giant
planeload of Mandy and guys that show up

133
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,160
that study for three months then write a
really great report that they had off to

134
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,209
their next customer saying what a great
job we'd it now let's think about this

135
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,860
for a moment

136
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,290
we are all probably familiar with the
way Lockheed Martin . breached right RSC

137
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,709
got preached and they store essentially
what amounted to one record they stole

138
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:37,180
the algorithm for generating those two
factor authentication tokens so then he

139
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,620
took out one record and they breached
Lockheed Martin now Lockheed Martin

140
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,560
doesn't admit the fact that classified
information

141
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,279
got stolen but 11 months later we see a
clone of the f35 and we see a clone of

142
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,790
the Reaper drone roll down the runway in
China so course you know we're not we're

143
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,649
gonna be sure here so my question to you
is if how do we put a value on that one

144
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:08,660
record that was stolen from RSA right
when now that one record was responsible

145
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,079
for what could be tens of millions if
not hundreds of millions of dollars of

146
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,939
theft and intellectual property so
you're going to see some swift on

147
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,980
security because she's fantastic and I
really enjoyed the ideas that they come

148
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,089
up with their more importantly we're
going to go through a little bit more

149
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:31,649
gonna take a look at some of these
attacks and we're gonna try and strip

150
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:36,110
away some of the stupidity and hype that
surround them and I think what's most

151
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,390
important is it worth spending a lot of
time and cameras are getting put on

152
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:46,029
people that should never talk to the
media

153
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:51,930
under any circumstance I say Utah public
safety commissioner key Squires ok now

154
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:58,370
I'm sure he has a great career in
counter-narcotics and bomb disposal but

155
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,949
he sounds like a complete tool when he
sounds up and he talks about a ten

156
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:17,870
thousand fold increase go ahead

157
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,940
super important a good public relations
firm will will save you a lot and we're

158
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,640
seeing this play out the TalkTalk breach
250 they're essentially doing everything

159
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,670
right but I want to go back to this
point here because we hear these terms

160
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,410
like twenty-five to thirty thousand at
Oxford a shaking our had these are not a

161
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:42,920
tax back in 1999 a guy by the name is
Scott Walton ok he got in trouble right

162
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,959
he got in trouble for scanning system
and he went to court and what the court

163
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,800
found was that yeah you know what you
did have that unauthorized access

164
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,410
component but you didn't do any damage
you didn't do the $5,000 in damage

165
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,270
that's required under the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act to consider it a attack ok

166
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:08,910
so this is what I'm going to if somebody
is paying you or end mapping you this

167
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:14,199
does not constitute an attack under the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ok it's an

168
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,960
inconvenience it's an annoyance but it
stands on cyber bullshit mountain as

169
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:25,070
being the most irritating statistic that
we hear all the time so we move onto

170
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,240
distributed denial of service

171
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,980
distributed in our service and I quote
volumetric her reflection weapon of

172
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,770
choice for hackers political activist
cyber extortionists in international

173
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:42,250
cyber terrors that's the kind of
language of people downloading the low

174
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,360
earth ion cannon and turning it on your
IP Idris ok these are the equivalent of

175
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,250
the orcs these are the igor's these are
not the people that are advanced

176
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,839
persistent threat groups although it
sure as heck sounds like these are

177
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,459
really bad people when you have things
like international cyber terrorists ok

178
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,989
this is really a before the firewall
problem so I worked pretty much

179
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,150
exclusively in small and medium
businesses that's where the company's

180
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:17,060
focuses so you're really dealing with a
situation where it's an ISP problem

181
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,239
ok and this is one of those things where
I know there's a lot of controversy

182
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,680
about that kind of statement but when
you look at the majority of businesses

183
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,138
that are online today they have a single
IP address and probably about 1.5 Meg

184
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:37,850
is down about 750 K up if they're lucky
ok and yes they can be victimized but in

185
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,670
our service attack but the point here is
that this is a nice people now we can go

186
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,719
back to good old coach basis who got
blown up but the important thing to

187
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,209
understand here is that the media
portrayed this is a victim of a

188
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:58,569
distributed denial of service attack ok
if you look what they actually said was

189
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:02,738
the hawkers were in us for several
months deleted our backups corrupted our

190
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:07,579
machines threatened us with a denial of
service attack so this is commonly cited

191
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:12,699
as I looked in our service attack is
really dangerous yeah but so is getting

192
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,368
letting the guys bad guys into your
system for three months

193
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:21,699
all right let's take a little bit of a
journey now into the brute force out

194
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:28,059
there okay so brute force is essentially
you know comes in flavors basically

195
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:32,969
exploring your your open ports and
trying to get passwords trying to force

196
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,649
your way in or now sequel injection
really falls into that category as well

197
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,489
but when you do this

198
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:45,369
annually VNC and RDP open to the
Internet

199
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:48,410
you're just asking for it

200
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,629
ok so figure it out TeamViewer LogMeIn
there's tons of different solutions out

201
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:55,319
there

202
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:59,399
choose so that you can architect an
entire network that has no ports exposed

203
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,019
especially in small and medium business
there's no requirement for hosted

204
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:07,819
services now that you're using
cloud-based services to have any ports

205
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,089
except maybe VPN open to the internet
and then we have another problem on our

206
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:12,799
hands

207
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,629
ok small-medium business we have
WordPress and unfortunately wordPress is

208
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,159
an advanced persistent threat and
enabling for cybercrime like nobody's

209
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:27,750
business and it's not that his bad
software

210
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,659
the problem is is that most people put
these WordPress installations on a

211
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:36,639
machine that they don't forget about ok
and it's like hey its corporate website

212
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:42,149
no big deal back in the day we had
defacement to tax we had guys that would

213
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,909
go in to face the website

214
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,790
and you go to the website me something
horrible and you restore from backup but

215
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,870
now it's happening is folks are getting
into your WordPress site they're leaving

216
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,830
the WordPress site alone and they're
building their fishing there drive-by

217
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,460
download sites on top of your site or
hosting their malware or using it as a

218
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,270
spam and just saw the attack is pivoted
from mir defeat defacement it's actually

219
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:12,770
people did now back to utilizing that
resource that they got ill gotten access

220
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,129
to and how do we know that this is kind
of going on in this is what's in the

221
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,940
mind so there is the suborder billing
the camo where you could make a

222
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,620
Microsoft Internet Information Server
reboot ok and really not a big deal you

223
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,969
throw pocket at it and it reboots but
Microsoft leg disc is a remote code

224
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:38,630
execution vulnerability and he pushed
out a patch fairly quickly locate 22nd

225
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:43,460
of April however on the 19th of April in
the underground forum that have put up

226
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:49,740
the picture of was a remote code exploit
for any movie any of these Internet

227
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,910
Information Service which both 22
percent of the internet you can believe

228
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:59,190
it that we give you remote code
execution on an unpatched machine ok so

229
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:05,200
whatever challenges right now is we need
to anticipate that this is the rapid

230
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,230
cycle that is going on in cybercrime and
we need to Patrick Cordingley I

231
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:14,940
recommending that people watch weekly
now ok and get into that cycle and

232
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,810
rhythm and one of the keys is if you
uninstall applications that are

233
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,450
vulnerable like flash well guess what
you have a lot less stuff to patch so

234
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,040
that's one way is to go now a lot of
folks say in twenty-two percent of the

235
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,600
internet how long is it gonna take the
bad guys to find those machines while in

236
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,520
about the time it takes to learn church
history you can find every single

237
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,400
unpatched Internet Information Server on
the Internet in about five minutes ok so

238
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,580
this idea that you're in rural Michigan
and you've got a little web server there

239
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,070
and it's running Internet Information
Server and you haven't had time to move

240
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,460
them to Apache basically it's gonna be
found its gonna get

241
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:04,250
grabbed so we get to phishing attacks so
phishing attacks we've all heard of them

242
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:11,000
this is really the number-one
cybercriminal attacker period right and

243
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,110
ransomware should be looked at as an
opportunity

244
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:20,379
ok it's a pain in the ass for sure but
its testing your ability to defend that

245
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:26,090
network ok its testing your ability to
basically do and make sure that you have

246
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,750
some business continuity in business
resiliency and unfortunately what we're

247
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:36,029
seeing is you know seventy-seven percent
of these incidents are deliberate

248
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:40,720
interaction because of users ok users
clicking on stuff users opening stuff

249
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,320
and we can't get angry with them for
that because quite frankly if they've

250
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,049
advertised for a job and they get resume
. zip the administrative assistant is

251
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:50,879
gonna open it

252
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,270
ok that's her job so unfortunately it
blows up and you've got around somewhere

253
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,799
in the early attacks removing a mystery
to rate actually mitigated that

254
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:04,940
completely but now we're into new phase
where this is just being executed a lot

255
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,350
of cases in a javascript and poisonous
JavaScript and sometimes we actually

256
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,840
have to litter users you stuff like that
so one of the best mitigating strategies

257
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,668
he can do is look at the application
whitelisting capabilities of the

258
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:22,490
operating system itself they called it a
blocker and it actually works quite well

259
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,590
in locking down environment preventing
folks running programs that they don't

260
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:33,889
have authorization to her to run so when
the breach of OPM in the opium breach

261
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:42,370
you have the white house suggesting that
businesses are correction the opium

262
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,408
apply patches for critical flaws
probably use antivirus products check

263
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:50,909
logs for attack indicators deploy two
factor authentication and strengthen

264
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,720
controls for privileged administrators
users basically take those administered

265
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,730
rights away my question would be why
wasn't this being done in the first

266
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,730
place

267
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,429
this is simple shet ok this is any and
we had some jokes last night but any

268
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:07,659
CISSP coming out of his course should be
able to do this

269
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,220
ok should be up to look at what the best
price

270
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,630
cases in the industry are I think it's
embarrassing and one of the reasons why

271
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,539
I think it's embarrassing and it's
confusing for opium is this the sort of

272
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:24,260
advice that they get from the FBI ok
social engineering or computer intrusion

273
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,350
techniques K computer intrusion
techniques I need an anti computer

274
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,010
intrusion technique device know you need
to tell your users not to click on

275
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:38,370
strange web links and when door open
attachments from people they don't know

276
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,559
so this is one of the things that I am
really disappointed about is that yes is

277
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,139
this a threat this is the cyber
equivalent of me picking up the phone

278
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,460
and asking you to give me money this is
what the threat is alright but no we

279
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,289
make it sound like computer intrusion
techniques are being used on you

280
00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:03,750
scary so we moved to drive-by downloads
and driver downloads are increasingly

281
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,360
becoming a problem because we can
deliver web links in a bunch of

282
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,860
different ways we can deliver by instant
messaging we can deliver it by email web

283
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,729
links and basically what's happening out
there is it poorly defended websites are

284
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:26,240
being used as proxies in the attacks ok
and what we need to do is we need to

285
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,840
focus on our websites on securing those
websites because those are the things

286
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,928
that are throwing out tens of thousands
of pieces of spam

287
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:38,059
those are the things that are being used
to host all this malware and if we

288
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,418
focused on defending that and making
sure that that wasn't compromised I

289
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:48,289
think we see a lot of value for security
money and it makes sense because look at

290
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:54,559
what the statistics tell us 54 percent
of our infections of our exploited

291
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,580
systems are coming from interaction with
the web

292
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,570
ok there's some compelling reasons for
you know email protection obviously like

293
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:08,158
barracudas and/or proxies to prevent
users from getting infected now one of

294
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,030
the reasons why cybercriminals have
moved away from delivering email as a as

295
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:17,760
a as a preferred means of attack and to
drive-by downloads is because of this K

296
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,950
and again we see flashes coming up again
but we see that the fact that these

297
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,149
browsers that we

298
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:28,080
the browsers that we have a really
responsible for getting some factions

299
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,070
onto the machines in the first place

300
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,369
ok and this is because the browser
interacts and much more deeper system

301
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:38,939
level than your actual email client so
this is one of the things that I'm

302
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,450
seeing in terms of the threat landscape
is pivoting towards that browser so what

303
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,599
is it happen was trying to convince the
business and this is kind of the old way

304
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,479
of thinking but trying to convince the
business that their reputation will be

305
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:57,869
at stake to be blacklisted there could
be an investigation or seizure

306
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:01,779
surveillance no-fly list all sorts of
terrible things can happen for not

307
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:06,599
securing your systems the reality is
that its economic that's going to drive

308
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,629
this and as we go through this we take a
look at some more of these attacks will

309
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:16,699
soon start seeing that everything we do
a 90 security can be easily quantified

310
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,279
dollar sense ok in terms of uptime and
in terms of availability of systems

311
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,899
that's where we need to focus on so we
get back to spear fishing spear phishing

312
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:31,908
is really interesting because it's the
most commonly used attack for those

313
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:37,320
advanced persistent threat groups ok for
the ones that you know make the news in

314
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,468
reality these are the equivalent of
oceans 11 style of attacks they're

315
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:48,609
really not cyber attacks in the classic
sense there are con jobs they are really

316
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:54,049
social engineering attacks and in some
cases the social engineering attacks is

317
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:59,320
where the vulnerability persists because
people are being asked to do things

318
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,418
because they think that's the right
thing that they should be doing and they

319
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,659
don't have good controls our policies in
place to change all of that because when

320
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:15,379
we analyze malware what does it really
do it only does 46 it modifies the

321
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:19,988
system registry ok so that usually it
runs right away it injects code in 2d

322
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:23,679
lower running process it drop something
onto disc or connects to the internet

323
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,070
and in fact if it's not doing those
things it's probably not malware ok and

324
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,718
the connect to the internet thing
especially in small medium business is

325
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,920
the smoking gun ok

326
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,980
that's having situation awareness of
your egress of what's coming out of your

327
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:45,610
network that will make a huge difference
so here's an example from a client that

328
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,820
had a problem and the problem was

329
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:54,840
is they were basically asked by a person
inside the company to transfer some

330
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:03,169
money and you'll notice the domains you
have artic DL and artic GLA ok so what

331
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,330
did the cybercriminals do here they
registered a domain that looked very

332
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:13,970
similar ok to the domain of the actual
customers so we took a little bit of a

333
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:19,400
look at this and as it turns out this
domain was registered by Vistaprint

334
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:25,320
technologies in Ontario and I said well
that's because you know you would think

335
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,060
that if you were conducting cybercrime
you probably wouldn't want to tell them

336
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,760
exactly who you were and how you
registered the domain so we came to the

337
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,170
conclusion that these folks have
probably been compromised in terms of

338
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:43,160
their two cows account to register
domains probably fairly badly

339
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,190
compromised or there's a possibility
that the admin over there was

340
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:54,050
moonlighting as a cybercriminal but then
we took a look and we found ok let's

341
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:59,290
look at this IP address well it turns
out it's an Amazon Web Services and you

342
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:05,350
know the driver criminals use the cloud
to ok and they had fifty four thousand

343
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,050
domains registered on the server

344
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,110
ok so now we're onto something it's a
little bit more interesting here because

345
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,149
we're not we're dealing with a whole
bunch of fraudulent remains and then

346
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,940
finally we take a look at what was
actually on that box and it was a squid

347
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,670
proxy in operation laundry service was
was commenced in I don't want to get

348
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:32,180
into those exact details but your action
plan here is really to help get rid of

349
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:37,410
the situation so you contact Vistaprint
and you see a problem you know clean up

350
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,400
your act or police were Canadians after
also will be polite

351
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,180
contact you cause you've got fraudulent
domain registration terms and conditions

352
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,090
of service violations request for a
blacklist removal the domain information

353
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:55,100
and certainly you can facilitate that by
calling up Vistaprint and their pretty

354
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,330
much certain gonna say we didn't
register that domain and maybe even want

355
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:05,070
their money back for registering that
domain contact Amazon fraudulent

356
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,879
activity Terms of Service violation
request for the takedown a server or

357
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,570
turn it over to the FBI ok so there are
ways that we can fight back in this

358
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,840
system against these folks that are
trying to get us in the simpler we make

359
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,790
it anyway this is kind of hot back but
this is kind of legal doc you found a

360
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,810
system that basically is conducting
crime against your organization in there

361
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:34,270
are some steps you can take to figure
out how to defend yourself so we in some

362
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:39,160
ways we started to create a better
criminal we've gotten to the point now

363
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,370
where we have what's called advanced
persisting group events persistent

364
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,929
threats and I'm gonna go into a few of
them were gonna talk we're going to talk

365
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:55,120
about a few of of what their activities
are sodium local were probably all

366
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,500
familiar with that attack which bricked
30,000 machines and caused probably a

367
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,190
great deal of work

368
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,420
outage for the organisation cost of
amount of money it was attributed to

369
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:14,120
state-sponsored hackers ok but what's
more important about this is this wasn't

370
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,729
delivered via email

371
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,940
this wasn't actually delivered even by a
weblink this was delivered by a USB

372
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:26,410
Drive by an insider militia threat so
one of the things that is quick to point

373
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,150
out when you're dealing with these kind
of destructive attacks usually the

374
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:35,100
delivery method is internal however
there's gonna be a few that we're gonna

375
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:41,719
see where the situation has evolved and
that really comes to advanced persistent

376
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,370
threat for nation states which I'm a
little bit more familiar with so what

377
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:52,719
we're gonna see here is that events
persistent threat four-nation foreign

378
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,910
intelligence services

379
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:59,150
combine all of the modus operandi of
your criminal organizations but they get

380
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,640
like an unlimited budget and no chance
of actually ever getting in trouble for

381
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,530
doing what they're doing so you have an
order of magnitude and sophistication

382
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:14,720
coming out you and there are some ways
and worked with Joe McCarthy on this

383
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,240
actually a boat crowded we build a
summer most rap in how do we catch these

384
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,610
guys at work because the difference
between a cybercrime attack is advanced

385
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,870
persistent threat is going to get in
there they're going to linger and

386
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,500
they're going to move around in your
network in general to cybercrime attacks

387
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,460
i've seen are the geyser in they get
what they need and they're so be a

388
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,640
credit cards

389
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,450
be it personally identifiable
information the attack doesn't last

390
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,490
when you're dealing with this this is an
attack on usually intellectual property

391
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:52,440
ok so going after whatever secrets you
might have to the idea here is to

392
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,100
isolate the network into segments and
really frustrate the bad guys from

393
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,580
moving around in the network who here
thinks that printer should be able to be

394
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:07,939
available on the internet right but
small and medium businesses are building

395
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,540
file file networks with no segregation
in these networks at all and the problem

396
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,780
is is that small medium businesses are
usually supplying the nuts and bolts for

397
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,460
larger possibly DOD possibly other
things

398
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,900
projects so the problem is is that if
you have an untouched HP printer on the

399
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,920
internet with every protocol known
tibetan to mankind being broadcast bad

400
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,770
things are good and one of the
interesting ideas around this

401
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,980
architecture where you're actually
having different subnets is for those of

402
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,710
us that do this kind of work you can get
in there you can near the port into that

403
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:51,150
particular subnet and look at all the
traffic of Wireshark and go listen I

404
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:56,500
have no humans in my office right now
the humans have gone home why am I

405
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,500
seeing HTTPS to Pakistan this doesn't
seem right

406
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,300
this doesn't seem normal so I wanna

407
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:10,600
I want to talk about this one attack
which was heralded as he is a cybercrime

408
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,889
talk of epic proportions now it was it
was attributed to the israelis in the

409
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:23,020
israelis targeted three luxury hotels
they targeted the luxury hotels to try

410
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,260
and get an idea on the negotiations that
were going on over there

411
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:34,010
new killer over the nuclear issues that
the Iranians were doing so what went on

412
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:38,650
here what was interesting because the
infected machines out with a number of

413
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:44,910
interesting exploits the most
interesting exploit was a if you can

414
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:50,720
still believe this and this is like 2014
ok I can give you a font file that when

415
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,230
you install that font file gives me
colonel level access to your Windows box

416
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:00,120
this vulnerability has been with us but
who here knows a little bit but Windows

417
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,689
security permissions anyone ok perfect
so what security permission do you need

418
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:16,380
to install files on a box correct you
are so what does this tell us about

419
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:22,550
these people that got infected this
resist 0 Day attack on phone files so

420
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,910
what happened here guys is that they
people had local admin on their laptop

421
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:32,239
and JavaScript injection because what
they did is they went to the portal for

422
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,819
logging into the hotel wifi that fired
up a javascript injection that delivered

423
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:41,120
this exploit onto their machines which
was essentially a font file that was

424
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,668
outside the constraints of its buffer
and overflowed and that allowed them to

425
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:51,940
land their malware ok we don't stop we
see what's really interesting because in

426
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:57,500
a network architecture folks should work
stations ever connect directly for DNS

427
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:03,510
to the internet no yeah usually you have
an internal DNS server that is

428
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,070
essentially a proxy for any workstation
request that's going outside your

429
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:12,420
network so if you wrote one firewall one
firewall that prevented workstations for

430
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,920
accessing the Internet directly you
would have shut down there eight da da

431
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,680
da da da

432
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,000
made tunneling that they were doing
further command-and-control alright so

433
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,630
two very simple things right there and
as we go along this defeats these kind

434
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:35,569
of attacks ok very easily and this is
why we need to build this cyber most rap

435
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:39,230
because they were taking a really long
time to figure out what's gone wrong

436
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:43,930
ok why it why we're getting known why is
our data getting an actual trade it

437
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,529
really comes down especially in small
medium business to death it comes down

438
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:55,030
to Equus we are not preventing stuff
from leaving our network ok so we're

439
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:59,160
letting our printers on the internet
send email

440
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,710
ok that doesn't sound like a good idea
unencrypted email as well

441
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:10,890
ok we're leaving things like the VNC and
RDP open on the internet again while not

442
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,308
you guys can you know what you're doing
but apparently some of our our brethren

443
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:22,170
are having caught in that memo yet so we
can do a lot of things we can talk about

444
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:27,420
deny rules for workstations inside that
subnet we can talk about deny rules for

445
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,940
admin boxes within that subnet we can
put printers on a subnet that doesn't

446
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,799
even go onto the internet and we can do
a whole bunch stuff road networks eg

447
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:41,410
segmentation an event logs so we can't
act that commanding control activity

448
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,759
because mao warehouse to reach out to
command and control server otherwise

449
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,760
it's not really matter where it's
something else that you gotta worry

450
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,970
about so I like to come up with this
simple rule weird shit equals compromise

451
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:01,819
ok and essentially it gives you a number
of different avenues to attack one bad

452
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:06,799
guys are inside your network alright
explosions general protection fault in

453
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:12,869
your event logs on machines that 72
hours ago weren't exhibiting that failed

454
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:17,410
patches when you can patch all of your
machines but one machine can't be pouch

455
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:21,569
because the patches keep failing that's
a machine that you maybe want to explore

456
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:27,869
a little bit further slow network
traffic in a lot of cases it's malware

457
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:28,620
causing them

458
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:35,630
ok or the ISP probably equal story sure
comcast customers probably 90% eyes and

459
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:40,800
when new ports open up on your firewall
when you see traffic coming out strange

460
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,030
ports that you never had before work
stations all of a sudden trying to NTP

461
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:51,340
outside the network that doesn't make
sense and when I talked about saving

462
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,680
your website's this is really what I met
its pretty easy business case 24 a web

463
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,270
application firewall its does your
website talk to a database can I see

464
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:07,560
what I type in a field on a page so can
I put 'I into the search bar that's

465
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,220
always a fun one to check out and just
the site look reference a local file if

466
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,870
it does those things if your website
does those things put a web application

467
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,940
firewall in front of it make it a hell
of a lot harder to hawk rather than

468
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,110
getting owned by some guy that's firing
up Metasploit and throwing a bunch of

469
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,330
cross site scripting vulnerabilities
against it

470
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:29,569
write these things aren't expensive
anymore they used to be used to be super

471
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:34,200
expensive now they can really come down
in price so what brings us to what I

472
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:42,390
call the granddaddy of them all in terms
of cyber since since legislation is kept

473
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,720
her skis accretion group which we all
know after reading what they did was the

474
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,600
NSA and they were used quotes such as
the God of cyber-espionage an

475
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:00,480
astonishing technical accomplishment the
Death Star of Mauer ok so let's let's

476
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,010
call it like it is this is a advanced
persistent threat nation state resources

477
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,560
I would expect them to be capable of
this except for the fact that this was

478
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,150
all disclosed this possibility in 2009 a
cancer breast ok and this report came

479
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:21,370
out i think is 2013 or 2014 alright so
this is kind of making hype out of

480
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,960
something that we already knew about it
we already knew that by US level of

481
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,750
factors in fact Dan Kaminsky before
years ago at DEFCON showed us how to

482
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,940
hide all sorts of cool stuff on a hard
drive for work

483
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:39,200
ok so this is all been around which
moves me to these two guys apt 28 points

484
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,470
storm probably been in the news quite a
bit

485
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:47,348
it an apt 29 temp monkeys ok this is
where things got really truly bizarre

486
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:53,060
any shows a lowest level possible in the
media in terms of reporting and what I

487
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:59,180
like to call the wheel of attribution ok
and how it worked well yes the Polish

488
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,750
Stock Exchange got attacked along with
French TV and the new york times because

489
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:10,340
credentials were put to stomp a spin and
Allah Akbar was mentioned it was

490
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:16,849
suddenly attributed to jihadists that
broke his website not russians armed

491
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:24,890
with axes agent Mark iOS this was later
disclosed and James copper of the FBI or

492
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,799
no he was suggested that perhaps the
russian threat was more severe than

493
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:36,670
previously assessed ok yeah I would I
would say so fast forward to apt 29 temp

494
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:42,800
monkeys who basically blew up or is
attributed to a blown-up a smelting

495
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:51,660
plant in in Germany they are armed with
some malware that targets ICS and SCADA

496
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,420
systems but again because your videos of
monkeys in the phishing emails that were

497
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:02,070
sent out to be the Chinese why because
monkeys don't live in Russia alright so

498
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:07,220
this is about the lowest bar in cyber
media hype that I've ever had and it led

499
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,500
to what I'm gonna call what is the
stupidest things that we've ever seen in

500
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,589
cybersecurity which was the treaty was
signed between the Chinese and Americans

501
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,220
that they wouldn't you know how each
other for economic reasons

502
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,799
anymore like we're just gonna agree that
we're not gonna hockey each other now

503
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,710
it's really interesting to me why they
signed this treaty it is a get out of

504
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,930
the shit that I made policy and I'll
tell you why

505
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:40,660
about a year ago President Obama signed
an executive order that basically stated

506
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,368
that after american company suffers
damage at the hands of a foreign company

507
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:53,640
there will be a compelling requirement
to sanction that offending country ok

508
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,368
we had the Chinese dead to rights on the
opium hack all the forensic evidence

509
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:05,109
pointed towards them and everything like
that ok so the point here is that for

510
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:09,000
economic reasons and the fact that the
United States and China are some of the

511
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,579
biggest trading partners and there's a
little fisticuffs brewing with the

512
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:17,480
chinese out there in the China Sea
amongst a bunch of other things this is

513
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,599
low-hanging fruit this was an easy thing
to do to appease everybody that were

514
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:29,039
taking strong action I suspect this will
do very little to deter any continued

515
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,660
Chinese attacks on american business or
any other nation for that matter because

516
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,868
that's not usually being conducted by
government operatives that is usually

517
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:43,700
subcontracted criminal organizations and
I bet after reading Brian kept his book

518
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,710
you'll soon see the connection between
the russian government and the

519
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,200
cybercriminals as being tenuous

520
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:56,149
there's a few more that I just want
export here one was that 81% of

521
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,799
healthcare executives say their
organizations have been compromised by

522
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:03,759
at least one malware botnets or other
kind of cyber attack during the past two

523
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:10,849
yrs 81% ok so what I'd like to know is
if this is really true why isn't there a

524
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:14,930
congressional committee looking at this
why are we concerned about a bunch of

525
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:20,480
emails on email server that was at home
and not the fact that 81% of our

526
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,740
healthcare organizations have been
breached or attacked so again this

527
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:34,709
strikes me as being you know one of our
full of it and and well recognized

528
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:40,480
consulting organizations drumming up the
cyber war drums in order to throw a few

529
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,990
more numbers of growth up there so we
talked a little bit about cyber

530
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,788
insurance it was a question that came up
and this is a really good good part so

531
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:53,869
columbia Casualty Company K

532
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:59,819
alleges that carnage health systems
failed to do a bunch of cybersecurity

533
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:05,250
thinks so great example is the impact
within a 30 day s la wind

534
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:10,030
go to a thirty days to get your patches
on your machines they failed to replace

535
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,470
some default settings settings on
security devices failed to undergo an

536
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:17,759
annual security ought to outsource data
to firms with poor security right maybe

537
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,020
small-medium businesses got sort of
outsourced their and failed to provide

538
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:27,440
adequate detection and tracking changes
the network so what happened

539
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,940
well the cyber insurance company said
you have an opinion and you're like what

540
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,120
you know we're not feelin it you had a
whole bunch of things he needed to do

541
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:44,810
and you didn't do it so we're not paying
so here's the answer in short of cyber

542
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:51,350
insurance cyber insurance is going to be
both awesome for our insurance for the

543
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:56,110
security industry and I'll get into why
that's gonna be in a case however in the

544
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,510
meantime it's going to be a case where
you're going to run two parallel

545
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:03,800
investigations you're gonna be running
an investigation to figure out what

546
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,470
happened and how bad that was then
you're gonna be running an investigation

547
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,549
usually buy high-priced consultants that
the insurance companies gonna bring it

548
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:16,980
to see if you were compliant ok so as
long as you have gobs of money you're

549
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,320
going to be fine and you might actually
get a pic however I believe right now

550
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,570
it's a million dollars per five hundred
thousand dollars in liability coverage

551
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:31,610
it's skewed so it really makes sense if
you're like a law firm and you are doing

552
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:36,280
two gigantic mergers of companies and
you want a cyber insurance policy to

553
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,480
cover that wall to wall the two
companies are merging and you're dealing

554
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,080
with files it makes sense because you
can build that back to the customer

555
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,730
it doesn't make sense if you're
small-medium business but it would make

556
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:53,360
sense is uninstalling flashin watching
updating your machines so one of the big

557
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,720
things that we saw at DEFCON this year
if you were there or if you were

558
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,100
following the news at all

559
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,200
was the one point four million chrysler
vehicles that were recalled everybody

560
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,490
probably if you were you know if you're
doing piecework in the sudan or

561
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:10,839
something he probably didn't hear about
this but the reality was is it was

562
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,940
heralded as a as a seminal moment in
security research we're responsible

563
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,060
disclosure led to led to this

564
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:25,299
ok I would suggest that it's G i'm
looking at its economic situation going

565
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,750
holy shit this huge business risk we
gotta fix this I don't think that this

566
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:34,620
was as altruistic a moment for human and
for security reasons we thought it was

567
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:40,069
and I will point out the fact that oddly
enough in this particular case it had to

568
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:44,480
be a demonstrative external attack
rather than a software review of the

569
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,660
software used in Volkswagen diesel
products ok so I find it kind of

570
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,560
interesting but let's let's just pretend
for a moment did it was a really good

571
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,130
thing the litigation that would have
happened to GM's should and we're

572
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:03,080
tossing this play out with Volkswagen
about the lying but the litigation that

573
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:09,140
would have transpired if people died as
a result of us hardware us offer more

574
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:14,450
durability would be extraordinary ok it
would be all-consuming and it could

575
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:19,370
seriously wreck or destroy the company
so I suggested and it was sort of backed

576
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:23,339
up by attention to the road to the
internet settings will be paid with

577
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,890
litigation and I want to give you an
example of this kind of tomfoolery if

578
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:34,259
you will so let's take a dishwasher for
instance that has a web server in it and

579
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,910
it's connected to the Internet and the
idea here is that in conjunction with

580
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:42,589
your smart house and everything I dot
it's going you run the dishwasher that

581
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:47,480
the most optimal time for you when the
price of your electricity is lost or you

582
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,330
can turn it on remotely if you know you
have customers coming off our customers

583
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:57,100
but found friends and family so here's
the problem with this if you know

584
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:03,790
anything about the Wii large businesses
do procurement so if you have a

585
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:08,880
contractor and you have any ed unit
apartment building you're going to buy

586
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,640
the same dishwasher install it

587
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,980
ok and let's say that some multistorey
apartment building I think you guys can

588
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,340
see where I'm going with this should put
the slide deck up with the flames with

589
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:25,830
the with the gas right on it because
here's the problem if that software

590
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:29,860
vulnerability can affect a dishwasher
then it can affect all of those

591
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,789
dishwashers

592
00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:34,509
and when you're in a giant building and
see this offer vulnerability allows you

593
00:48:34,509 --> 00:48:38,900
to take remote control that dishwasher
and see you put some malware into it

594
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:43,869
that makes the dishwasher full but not
during out ever you turn on all the

595
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:50,009
dishwashers in the apartment complex all
80 of them at the same time you're not

596
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:53,029
talking about millions of dollars in
damage

597
00:48:53,029 --> 00:48:57,390
all right and this is where it comes
down to the insurance the insurance will

598
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:00,729
have to pay to put everything back
together again

599
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:05,118
millions of dollars if there's one thing
that can be universally said about

600
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,109
insurance companies is they never like
to pay out ever so they have a power

601
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:15,719
cord subrogation does anybody know what
that term is going on at the back it

602
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:22,650
allows an insurance company when it has
to pay out a claim to sue everybody ok

603
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:27,569
now that puts a shiver up the spine of
the computer programmer in Belarus who

604
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:31,619
was responsible for that software
vulnerability that puts a shiver up the

605
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:39,989
spine of the manufacture date was pushed
to Q&A that washing dishwasher so here

606
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:43,829
we have a situation where insurance
companies are going to take a dim view

607
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:49,390
of physical damage resulting from
software vulnerabilities I truly feel

608
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:56,269
then in the weeks and months and years
ahead that we will see a situation where

609
00:49:56,269 --> 00:50:03,328
software is treated the equivalent of
when you make it crypt that kills babies

610
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:09,199
and you put your baby in there the CEOs
and executives go to jail and usually

611
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:13,179
the company's find out of existence not
to mention having to pay compensation

612
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:19,769
for all those people that it hurt so I
can see this moving forward no one of

613
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:23,288
the cool things that were doing I'm just
dump it gets a little bit dark and nasty

614
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:27,409
arm I'm gonna people a little bit and
talk a little bit about our automated

615
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:34,089
Big Data future in one of the things
that I want to start seeing is cyber

616
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:38,288
threat information being shared amongst
different pieces of software not give

617
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:43,279
you an example here so see you have a
feed from Barracuda our mail protect

618
00:50:43,279 --> 00:50:49,199
thing you find out those top five
thousand spamming IP irises and you have

619
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:55,599
maybe a whole bunch customers if their
IP address shows up on that top list

620
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,119
well you've got an indication of
compromise right there so we don't need

621
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:05,559
to go through this extended process of
Lake forensically we just need to look

622
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:09,489
at the fact of whether or not our
network is blasting email that we can

623
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:13,739
account for it doesn't seem that
difficult especially the Small Medium

624
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:17,640
Business and Enterprise I'm gonna say it
probably gets a little bit more complex

625
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,989
but what I want to do that is I want to
be able to block anybody's access via

626
00:51:22,989 --> 00:51:24,759
web to those sites

627
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:29,630
why because the machine that is sending
out that email is quite possibly hosting

628
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:35,900
not only a command and control node but
also the drive-by download site ok so by

629
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,089
preventing our users from visiting it by
identifying the fact that this machine

630
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:44,619
is perhaps even inside a customer's
network we have an opportunity for a big

631
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:50,699
win so let's look at one more attack
let's look at the car panic attack know

632
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:55,150
this is really interesting because the
report came out and it said between 300

633
00:51:55,150 --> 00:52:00,079
million and one billion dollar losses
one billion dollar losses that seems

634
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,509
really tremendous ok and it was mostly
against Russians and Eastern European

635
00:52:04,509 --> 00:52:08,779
banks and they think it was a Russian
Chinese mixed crew of pretty

636
00:52:08,779 --> 00:52:13,469
sophisticated folks and there's a number
of different durations of this attack

637
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:17,390
that the one specifically I'm gonna talk
about was how did the bad guys get the

638
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:21,939
malware onto the banking system
computers this is what interested me the

639
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:22,368
most

640
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:28,179
so all of their cases used spear
phishing emails again alright so we're

641
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:31,890
talking about spear phishing emails and
look what they were sending you were

642
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:40,509
saying sending . deal see files or Word
documents and/or Cpl false ok when I

643
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:45,279
find really interesting about this is
they're using vulnerabilities from 2012

644
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:50,909
2013 and 2014 all of which have been
patched all of which have been patched

645
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:56,200
so this situation I find his two very
interesting

646
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:01,160
things to me first says the financial
institutions in question we're so

647
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,180
obsessed with perimeter security that
they were not doing a vulnerability

648
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,740
patch management inside their network ok

649
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:13,399
the second thing is it would appear as
they didn't even have antivirus on it

650
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,470
because the actual Trojan that was used
in the attack was four years old

651
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:21,759
ok so the so what was going on here

652
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,070
not patched an updated machines no
antivirus or ineffective antivirus

653
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,300
two things could have prevented this
stock right there

654
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,109
know why three hundred billion three
hundred million to 1 billion why that

655
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:39,890
such a range number to this state banks
don't know which were legitimate

656
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:44,490
financial transactions and which word
because what did that remote access

657
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:50,129
Trojan do it set up the equivalent of
the Clooney and Pitt seen in oceans 11

658
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:54,030
where they put a camera in front of a
fake vault and the guys are watching

659
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:59,619
everything is ok what happened what was
the user experience while the users were

660
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:04,270
told that after the abused their
two-factor authentication token ice

661
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:07,420
cream came up saying that there is a
problem with your account please call

662
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,960
this one nine hundred number 1 800
number and we'll walk you through your

663
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,300
verification in meantime the cyber
criminals were behind that screen user

664
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,829
receiving doing legitimate banking
transactions with the two-factor

665
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:27,690
authentication added banking out ok so
it was one of these attacks where they

666
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:31,530
set up a call center and they asked date
of birth and captured all sorts of

667
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:35,960
information probably before whatever the
equivalent of an Eastern European long

668
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,410
weekend is right about four o'clock in
the afternoon where you just want to get

669
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:44,430
the fuck out of work so this was
attacked it did couple interesting

670
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,759
things one day

671
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,660
absolutely knew what their targets were
I think they probably reconnaissance the

672
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,589
environment

673
00:54:50,589 --> 00:54:55,950
three probably Eastern Europe even banks
are a little bit not so much with the

674
00:54:55,950 --> 00:55:00,109
licensed software so they couldn't
patching update or they didn't patch an

675
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:05,660
update and they had in effect of any
virus so again this was again proclaimed

676
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,299
as one of these sophisticated
cyberattacks doesn't really sad

677
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:15,570
and too sophisticated to me so we're
getting to the end here so how do we

678
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:20,590
manage this how really do we do do we do
what we do without getting so depressed

679
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,620
about it

680
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:27,810
well let's move away from sensationalism
let's examine the let's not examine the

681
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:31,279
consequences of a breach because we know
that if we get breach we kinda probably

682
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,710
lose our jobs right it sucks for us so
who is not important is how and

683
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:42,790
compromise indicators are more important
than financial costs right you most

684
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:47,520
important thing for my world though is
that the data is derived from large

685
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:52,750
enterprises is not relevant SMB and the
bottom line here is that when we hear

686
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:57,350
about breach what we need to know is
what failed in that organization not

687
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:01,580
about the malware what were some of the
factors that led to the compromise

688
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,120
that's more interesting because I'm
running a hospital from running a

689
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:09,480
financial institution I want to know how
those guys got owned so that I can make

690
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:15,230
those changes and lastly let's get
really good at back up okay

691
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:21,360
backup and restore it sounds trivial and
it sounds awful but it's really the only

692
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:27,290
thing that will save your ass and it'll
save your ass from self-inflicted right

693
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:32,690
where you do something and you go oh
shit right but it also CD from the bad

694
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:37,110
guys especially when it comes to rats
more and I can't tell you how many times

695
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:41,910
I've been to unaudited where the backups
are just atrocious or they're just not

696
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:47,020
happening or the guys gave up right or
the SE which gets them almost a free

697
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,620
throw project we have raised so we don't
need backup so don't don't fall into

698
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,810
that track

699
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:57,000
yes you're offering so that's it I want
to thank you for your kind attention

700
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,670
truly appreciate it and I'll be hanging
around for the next day and I guess we

701
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:06,910
have some time for questions

702
