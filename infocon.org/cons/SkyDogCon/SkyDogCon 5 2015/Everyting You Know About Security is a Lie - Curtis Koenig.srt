1
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,420
those kind of confines

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:28,590
you don't get scared I can't talk about
non technical stuff for something that's

3
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,610
more along the lines of the human brain
you're in the right place I also like to

4
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,670
have a good time I talked so they gave
you foam footballs those heavy

5
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,059
usefulness I have said it many years if
you want my attention

6
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,870
throw something at me just don't hurt me
the foam footballs are perfect for those

7
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,820
to show me show me to stop your question
you raise your hand you can throw

8
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,449
something at my friends will obviously
throw something at me the other thing is

9
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:56,830
this is kinda wanna know hands on the
couch why is nobody encounter con go

10
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:02,479
ahead call me to call different I've
always loved that about Scott Caan

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,560
there's plenty of space for people on
the couch you will find me there at some

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,540
point later either today or tomorrow or
throughout the weekend so what is this

13
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,240
everything you know about security is a
lot again I talk about sort of very

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,890
slightly off-kilter topics and I like to
ask the question why Allah a few if any

15
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,469
of you have kids you know that kids ask
why into you wanna throw told them

16
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:34,169
sometimes you get to the point where you
can't answer a question I sort of got

17
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,149
into asking lots of questions about why
things were the way they were and I and

18
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:45,420
i got to wondering why is it in InfoSec
and web security that we have the Los

19
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,240
top 10 we know the answers to most of
the questions were asking the problems

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,710
were having but we continue to have the
same problems over and over and over and

21
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,068
if you look at the top 10 changes very
little over time yes they've changed the

22
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:06,609
wording that looks and stuff together so
it looks like the top 10 changing but in

23
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:10,449
reality they're not we're still dealing
with cross site scripting we're still

24
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:16,290
dealing with sequins action we're still
dealing with input validation issues and

25
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,150
users continue to make the same mistakes
that we've been trying to train them for

26
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,060
for twenty years

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,990
train them

28
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,680
try different training they still make
the same mistake what is it about what

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,190
we're doing this not working why it
bugged me for a really long time and I

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,130
happened to stumble upon a TED talk by
Dan pink you get a chance go watch it

31
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:48,190
has nothing to do with InfoSec but it's
a great talk I'm barring some bits from

32
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,930
him to work through this story with you
all that you know we're going to talk

33
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,340
about today so damn talks with the same
hold the candel problem if you know the

34
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,770
answer to this please don't yell it out
for the rest of the room you know let

35
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,020
them work it on the rune but the idea
for the Kindle problem is I'm gonna give

36
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,930
you these three objects media box
attacks candle and a set of matches your

37
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:19,240
challenge is yes it does but it's bigger
than yours for you is I want you to

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,750
mount the candle to the wall above the
table yes I did such that the wax does

39
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,250
not follow such as the candlestick
mounted on the wall of a table any ideas

40
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:41,540
on solutions come on you guys are smart
somebody give me a solution I can do it

41
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:48,599
most people start off well the box

42
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,899
ok fine I'll take the matches will burn
some of the candle wax it to the wall

43
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,950
accidentally the correct answer is you
take the tax out of the box you melt the

44
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:09,518
box to the wall it's it's it's a very
non drip you really think about it so

45
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,989
this experiment was done by a bunch of
economist done by a bunch of social

46
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,889
psychologist has been done for forty
years and oddly enough the solution to

47
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:28,199
this problem is not terribly hard to
find people who are members but it also

48
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,919
shows an interesting subset of how your
mind works when presented certain kinds

49
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,948
of problems so the modification of this
experience was done by Sam blacksburg

50
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,880
what he did is he said are you gonna
take a group of participants we're gonna

51
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,380
break into two groups of one group we're
gonna tell them we want to do this

52
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,030
scandal problem and we're gonna have you
establish the norm for the solution so

53
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,570
we're just gonna have you solved the
problem will stop the time we just want

54
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,380
to know how long it takes the other
group E

55
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,800
he gave us incentive model too he said
if you are in the top 25% fastest times

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,349
we're gonna pay you $5 if you know
you're in that second group gonna pay

57
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:17,659
you $10 and if you're in the fastest
group here that fast as 5% were gonna

58
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:19,889
give you $20

59
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:24,630
groups just trying to solve a problem
and the other groups incentivize with

60
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,449
money to solve the problem so which
group do you think beat the problem the

61
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,370
fastest

62
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:45,580
why the one getting money

63
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:54,448
why the an incentive

64
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:00,469
very close the on incentivize group is
in general three and a half minutes

65
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:05,779
faster than solving this problem very
counterintuitive thinking normal

66
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:09,439
business we think the world of business
people to do better at something I'll

67
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,509
pay them money give them something so
the original experimenters said well

68
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:23,199
maybe this is a function of the exact
same experiment in India where the

69
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,669
highest incentive turns out to be almost
two months worth of salary little

70
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,359
incentives about a month to lower
incentive is still pretty good same

71
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,729
exact experiment same exact questions

72
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:40,438
same exact outcome occurred however the
highest paid actually performed the

73
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,719
worst of any group overall in the entire
experiment so the more money you gave

74
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:51,899
people the worst they perform which
really really strange and again that

75
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,050
social psychologists and the economist
look at this and say distance doesn't

76
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,849
make any sense

77
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:01,210
are tired careers we've spent thing you
want people to do better you give them

78
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,210
some incentive to go there you give them

79
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,560
carrot and stick movements to go places
and that causes people to do things

80
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,459
better so this flew in the face of years
of intuitive thinking about how we got

81
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:23,589
people to do anything it's that counter
intuitive part of this that got me

82
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:29,349
really thinking about interesting parts
of it why do we incentivize people to do

83
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:33,449
what they do in business why do we
incentivize people in the digital space

84
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,649
to do something you know however it is
we do it what kind of reward we give

85
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:42,810
I've talked in the past about how you
build communities I talked in the past

86
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,550
about how you manage different stressful
parts there's very interesting parts of

87
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,399
the brain going on here that are
matching up with these groups to cause

88
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,459
the sort of incentivized
counter-intuitive problem very

89
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,800
interesting part of this is if you
perform a slight variation on this

90
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,000
experiment were all you do is take the
tax out of the box to incentivize group

91
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,230
destroys everyone

92
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:12,900
all you change in the experiment remove
the tax from the box and what that does

93
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,320
is cause people to see the box as an
object instead of just a receptacle for

94
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:27,780
carrying this is called functional
fitness people see exactly what they are

95
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,710
they can't they can't move their heads
outside of that box this group in

96
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,909
particular you find a lot of people who
do pen testing or application security

97
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:41,850
we tend not to have a lot of functional
fix it I'm not exactly sure why this is

98
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,080
one of the next questions I really want
to dig into this group tends not to have

99
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
functional fitness where the group that
looks at duct tape and baling wire as a

100
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,270
better way to fix a car taking to the
mechanic we fix stuff ourselves we look

101
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,550
at computers and networks and websites
as a well what does this button do

102
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:06,209
besides being what can I do with this
thing that you know someone else's gonna

103
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:13,960
think I can make a blender out of a
drill an apparent scissors there's no

104
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:19,890
functional fix it it's a really
interesting question so how about the

105
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:26,490
application of does it work with that
anybody this one thing that I've

106
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:36,380
observed is this like societal even if
we don't necessarily want to fit into a

107
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,980
mole not for the reasons that I'm
rebelling cause I'm a teenager it's more

108
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,490
of the

109
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,200
if it doesn't work if it doesn't fit
just throw it out like why do I have to

110
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,620
abide by it makes sense and yeah I don't
have to use the way it's i'm told these

111
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,710
guys I want to rebuild against being
told you a rebellion perspective I guess

112
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,080
but you know where some people that's
what it's about but for us it's more or

113
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,440
less this just harsh reality of it is
what it is they're working like doesn't

114
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,510
work and if not or if it's supposed to
work this way what happens when I do

115
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,680
this to it

116
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,140
definitely experiment experimental
culture there what if I take this thing

117
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,750
and I use a different way like for
example earlier today he needed to reach

118
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,480
the roof when you stood on three tool
boxes we had a perfectly good latter

119
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,940
available but we weren't going to use it
it was too far away

120
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:41,959
we're gonna get the job done what it
boils down to at least in these

121
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:48,140
experiments is that when we have a task
that only requires mechanical skills ie

122
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,510
the second part of the experiment
bonuses work exactly as you would expect

123
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,050
them to you don't need to think to solve
that problem it's a mechanical problem

124
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,740
take part a foot into slot B attached
part C moving down the line

125
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,050
incentives work great with you don't
have to do anything that involves any

126
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:15,349
sort of thinking you add even
rudimentary thought or problem solving

127
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,480
the whole incentive model falls to the
ground

128
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,839
interesting you know when you grow up
your whole life he worked hard to get in

129
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,630
a well I'm asking you to do something
mechanical but we're still carried in

130
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,939
sticking that sort of thing you know
parents apparently I stuff up a do anal

131
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,070
give you be you know a lot of times it's
mechanical good clean your room not real

132
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:46,870
hard to pick up off the floor and you
know but I look at my 13 year old now

133
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:53,279
and I say go make dinner may not
necessarily know all the steps for

134
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,020
making them he's old enough to know how
to cook he can make you know simple

135
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,100
meals he's not going to be making you
feel saltimbocca

136
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,350
make some fried chicken with vegetables
and you know some other side so you can

137
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,690
read the instructions of figured out you
go in the kitchen and problems but if

138
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:17,740
you carrot and stick the problem he
fails to make tacos and before he even

139
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:23,370
brown the meat was thrown water in the
pan and taco sauce I'd like to not die

140
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,350
please cook the meat completely your dad
does not enjoy the runs

141
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:34,430
is not not fun for me and when I begin
to add sort of punishment I case you

142
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,859
can't do this right we're gonna his
performance fell precipitously so few

143
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,080
nights later earlier this week my wife
and I were going out for anniversary and

144
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,950
if you need to make dinner for your
sister is your moment ever leaving the

145
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:53,180
stuff is on the counter when you're
ready go take care of it wasn't General

146
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,420
Tso's chicken I do take the chicken out
put it on a sheet pan figure out how to

147
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,709
turn on the oven to the right
temperature cook vegetables in a bag you

148
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,260
throw my grades would use punch the
numbers on it and rice in a rice cooker

149
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:11,380
and I just gotta let him to it and he
asked me one question you said to

150
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,380
address the preview button on the other
there is no prenup but not the oven sign

151
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:24,210
in instead of ghetto giving you think
you might solve that ok what happens if

152
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,900
you push that well nothing ok what
happens if you push that button right

153
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,540
next to you push that number comes up
with a temperature the other three

154
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,880
changes that but anyway my wife and I
love for dinner he'd made dinner for

155
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:50,730
himself and his sisters the only
incentive was to eat

156
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,760
well that's why we're gonna argue hardly
needs versus

157
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:10,040
if that was the case why do you like it
right away even have the job done

158
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,920
talking in this case you are correct in
the macro sense of saying hey I'm not

159
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,560
going to solve a problem i'm talking
more than make her sense of small

160
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,069
carrots and sticks it moves along for
discrete tasks so very much like the

161
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,010
candle probably gonna discrete tax that
has to get done is that task mechanical

162
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:33,389
or is that task mental and this in this
data seem very strongly suggest that any

163
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,029
time we having mental thinking problem
giving people care instinct is gonna

164
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:44,230
fail ok so this comes down maybe to some
semantics to one of the ideas I started

165
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,870
thinking about what we talked about
security along with israeli security

166
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,750
well it's a mental constructs that we
you know using language and has a

167
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,610
particular application this is the
literal definition of security right out

168
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:04,110
of merriam-webster to a large degree
this line up to what we talked about

169
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,510
overtime is a I see availability
integrity integrity and confidentiality

170
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:18,019
security has a very specific meaning two
people notice talks about safety so

171
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:23,440
what's the definition of safety seat
he's just a little different

172
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,699
your seat he talks about this freedom
from home in the state of being

173
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:31,479
dangerous or harmful and I really
latched on to that particular part of

174
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,019
the definition will need a minute when
we talk about security users we're not

175
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,149
really talking about the fact that the
thing is confidential or integrity

176
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,279
available most of the time sometimes we
are most of them were talking about with

177
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,220
them like we talked about a phishing
email or website we're talking about

178
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,610
this idea of safety we're saying that
this thing is probably can't say

179
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:59,579
definitively all-time probably not
actually gonna cause you harm but we use

180
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,400
the word securities I think there's
there's probably a mental list

181
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,610
connect their to some degree with the
language that we use with users and what

182
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,560
we're thinking about it so I started
thinking about like phishing email

183
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,300
secure confidential I could have sent it
to you

184
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,270
cryptid I can guarantee that it has
integrity that didn't change in some way

185
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:30,900
but I can't guarantee that it's a very
different things one being in action in

186
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:38,310
the other being a state so how you think
about that in your mind so I'm gonna do

187
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,219
a little experiment talk about a few
more things so this is just a regular

188
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:49,310
traffic see anybody get any anxiety over
this caused any problems that would

189
00:16:49,310 --> 00:17:01,800
bother you could be oddly enough you can
see your pictures just like this to

190
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,579
veterans who recently returned from war
zones and they can flip out they really

191
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:13,800
don't like cars being they've been
conditioned for certain activity yeah it

192
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,349
interesting so what you consider safe
like right now in this room we all have

193
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,760
very different definitions of what we
consider safe and secure for some people

194
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,490
I walked into this room carrying a
handgun visibly they would get very

195
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:32,710
nervous about four other people that's
ok whatever some of that your past some

196
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,280
of that your conditioning someone that's
how you view the situation

197
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:56,330
same idea so how about this one problem
with this one

198
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,340
perfectly normal for them if you're not
thinking about it you're actually not

199
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,490
going to notice a danger to you really
start thinking wait a minute things

200
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:11,410
moving and crap and I can tell you from
personal experience being in London that

201
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,710
the first time I got London camera guy
went to the left

202
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:22,950
I practically put my pants russia now ok
everyone going this way we're OK and

203
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,909
then made a left turn onto a one way
street almost lost it again and oddly

204
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:30,500
enough I have that same I have that same
sort of reaction there's an interchange

205
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:43,250
in little from 571 curved get you one
highway to another's nothing fancy but

206
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,679
every time I go through that curve I
literally start sweating and the reason

207
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,190
is five years ago at about 5:30 in the
morning driving away from my son

208
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,140
sleeping in the back seat we're going to
meet my cousin cuz we're going to drive

209
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,990
to Dayton to see the air show up early
in the cargo door stuff and being

210
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,110
driving we are halfway to my cousins
house we're going to pick him up and it

211
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,490
rained just a little bit that's more
morning and I was going just a little

212
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,280
too fast is about five miles over the
recommended speed for that curve and

213
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,110
when I hit the top of the curve
literally spun around and I bounced off

214
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,049
one side then the other and landed on
the other side again and we walked away

215
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:31,460
thankfully no one was hurt we walked
away even to this day even especially if

216
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,360
there's been little rain or snow I go
through that I'm like I'm ten miles an

217
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:43,399
hour through that I don't know I've been
conditioned to think that that area is

218
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,860
unsafe so if a user and I've done
something like liquor fishing me

219
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,919
and I got a virus

220
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,410
why is it that I don't perceive that as
being unsafe the second time it shows a

221
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:08,510
continuing to do that same action over
and over her over and the same thing

222
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,460
with developers why do they continue to
rate code that we know they're going to

223
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:17,120
attack I suppose that has to do
something with functional fix it we are

224
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,479
so conditioned even though these are
safety warning security when I don't

225
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,910
care

226
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:28,419
yes but I'm running that code I'm
clicking OK cause I'm so focused on the

227
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:33,760
functional fitness of the OS and you
either is presented to me as well as the

228
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,910
fact that in my own mind I'm trying to
go through something rather than

229
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:48,490
thinking about it and I'm making poor
choices that depends I i workplaces

230
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,740
where if you do that you could get fired
only nothing was never get fired just

231
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,059
said it's proof that not only do we have
to stick we don't use it or is that like

232
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,480
you know if ok I click on it I get a
virus hey my iti will fix it I don't

233
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,890
worry about that that's part of it too
so there's there's definitely an

234
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,110
ecosystem surrounding this question of
how do we get users to make better

235
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:19,120
choices developers me how do we how do
we up the ante to people that this does

236
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,928
not mean sate security the only thing
that lock has ever made is that the

237
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:29,460
communication channel between these two
things has been to some degree security

238
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,140
in a very specific way it doesn't make
the change safe there could still be

239
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,780
malware on this page there could still
be anything any number of things that

240
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,049
could hurt and then on top of that it
doesn't even match across different

241
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,220
types of browsers that supposedly
follows dangers on the way in the same

242
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:54,860
way they don't match anyway so even if
you stated it in your own company

243
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,370
there's an interesting reaction to that
so again I was thinking about what you

244
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,500
know coupled with his will why do I get
to Switzerland

245
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,750
turn this corner users have that same
reaction and I happen to go find this

246
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:49,550
very interesting video on the internet
and running in the House already gave

247
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,919
their standing in picking up pieces of
bomb which 1 a.m. I am i smart enough to

248
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:01,530
say well that's not gonna be close look
be struggling to find all my house now

249
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,270
which one are you

250
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:11,460
largely depends on again this concept of
what have i mean conditioned to react to

251
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,210
certain events happen

252
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:20,100
ok so this this this whole thing is
going on I've been thinking about this

253
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,500
for six months to a year now and then
Google comes out with this really

254
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,420
interesting study that drove us home
again so Google went out and they did

255
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,110
this security study where they asked
experts and non-experts a bunch of

256
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,060
interesting questions and this was this
was sort of the infographic that caught

257
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,830
me I'm gonna dig into the paper just a
little bit but I thought this was really

258
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,949
interesting like if I'm not expert the
most important thing for me is using

259
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,740
antivirus Johnny Cash were here again
this year he'd love that and then the

260
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,030
second thing is strong passwords it
doesn't matter that I might reuse them

261
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:03,139
but you know I want to go to website say
no and I'm not going to any personal

262
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,260
information those are things that I
think if I'm not an expert in security

263
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:14,500
will notice they don't line up at all
with the other side there's no antivirus

264
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,150
left the only thing that matters is use
strong passwords and even then as

265
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:25,030
experts we think they're less important
for the most part as a as a as a large

266
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:31,840
group will use password managers I can
get my mom to use a password that

267
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,760
doesn't involve a word she can remember
from the nineteen fifties

268
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:43,000
I guarantee you she's I'd love to use a
password manager

269
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,310
you know we used two factor auth they
most time do you have any idea what it

270
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,649
is

271
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:53,250
corporation's profits you make them do
you go to their desk and you stable the

272
00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:00,710
RSA key to their hand or something you
know they don't care so again I guess it

273
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,830
was a really interesting paper so I dug
into a little more and this is the

274
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:09,540
larger this is actual data from the
paper that the demographic was built so

275
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,810
what this shows is if the item was
mentioned by at least 5% of each group 5

276
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:21,480
percent not very big most experts said
they would keep their system updated

277
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,760
used two factor auth to stay safe not
experts emphasize antivirus and strong

278
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,240
passwords the experts being the dark
bars and non-experts being the wider

279
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,500
berth

280
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:47,370
really bad it's not that the little
cleaning use Linux like even the experts

281
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,239
are saying okay that doesn't matter so
much as much as we like that you know

282
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,700
the whole use Linux is checking checking
with https sort of in the middle there

283
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,180
as well and then the antivirus when it's
hilarious because it's just so largely

284
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,470
different as well as update your system
they could care less about updating

285
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:11,650
their systems again it's that safety
security functional disconnect hey I got

286
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:16,360
a strong password with someone gonna do
to me so

287
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:32,969
we tried very hard that's true they do
break a lot further than that

288
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,429
there is there's definitely a perception
that updating can be dangerous to the

289
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:41,320
software really lover that I used to do
my job what I find interesting is your

290
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,879
Microsoft you know turned on automatic
updates for critical stuff in Windows XP

291
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,440
and Windows 10 they upped the ante on
that now people are really pissed hey

292
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:05,460
sup fixing my computer

293
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,090
yeah video thing was brought up as he
said that we're coupling feature

294
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:16,110
enhancement with security some some
software makers of decoupled those

295
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,270
things maybe not very well but to a
large degree they've tried to decouple

296
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,070
them and then you have users say well
I'm paying you wind up giving me the

297
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:28,049
cool free stuff but then on the web you
have exactly the opposite you know what

298
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:31,870
you're doing a job frameworks and our
places of business and we're putting on

299
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,389
a new version of the website in some
places daily you know you're you're

300
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,890
rolling out new features to users as
fast as you can

301
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:44,159
are you rolling out security fixes as
fast or you could screening is fast are

302
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,399
you verifying any of the securities that
you do that maybe you do one security

303
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,979
sprint for every five maybe that covers
I don't know again let any research that

304
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:03,340
really has to be done in like 50 charts
in this in this report and the really

305
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,709
interesting this is the other one that
really grabbed my attention so this is

306
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,220
the percentage difference of experts and
non-experts who you mentioned this

307
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,510
specific security thing when asked what
are the top three things introduced a

308
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:20,230
safe online so what this measures if
it's above along a positive difference

309
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,029
were mentioned more by experts and if
it's below the line it was mentioned

310
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:30,010
more by non-experts so again use Linux
little tiny soccer there just falls

311
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:35,120
below so not what I find funny as it was
mentioned more by non-experts like okay

312
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,219
they have no idea what Linux least they
know you know but you got the start of

313
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,760
top seven things therefore experts up
again update two factor auth password

314
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,870
manager unique password and check if
HTTPS that's what we did so again why

315
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,559
are we not translating some of this
stuff to users like really verified

316
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,200
software help that's really freaking
hard even as an expert on you know let's

317
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,390
you know the intricacies of digital
signatures verify them you know it's not

318
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:10,659
hard to sign something and throw it at
somebody box or authentic code on wheels

319
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:14,340
for the longest time I could find
something with thought you would run

320
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,439
the lowest level of security certificate
in the world didn't go to some degree

321
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,070
our own security measures were
encouraging people to make really poor

322
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:29,289
security decisions by literally not
looking so we condition them to follow a

323
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:40,760
functional path to make a fixed given
choice literally so how do we change

324
00:29:40,760 --> 00:30:05,330
that sort of set of behavior and this
goes

325
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:34,250
different experts my dad's a doctor
commercials for drugs come on TV have a

326
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,350
very different sort of effect for him
than they do for me even though I'm a

327
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,750
med school dropout

328
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:45,180
look at a lot of stuff whatever but you
know other people going oh my god I have

329
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,920
this whole blog called my doctor right
now gimme this drug so there's

330
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,580
definitely no expertise kept there and
that that's a very interesting point

331
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,960
yeah I think we all have to some degree
depending on your job you may even have

332
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:08,010
to endure fatigue how often is a vendor
call you may be bottoming in exactly do

333
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,570
you do it didn't match up to what they
promised was going to do to me that's

334
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,090
why we do P O sees as much as we do
where I am the really long we're gonna

335
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,399
beat the crap out of this thing is going
to be everything they've ever told us

336
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:27,590
it's gonna do or we're done even if its
pixels off not buy it doesn't solve 8024

337
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:34,510
me so yeah we do get it differently but
coming back to where I was so in in the

338
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,940
candle problem in Indian pinks talk he
talks about how do we get people out of

339
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,200
this functional fixing this issue with
carrot-and-stick incentives that cause

340
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,840
failure or cause them to poorly
performed and it comes down to three

341
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,250
things autonomy which is the ability for
you to have directional your own life

342
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,080
you know we we want to have that control
mastery the desire to better at

343
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,899
something and purpose the idea that
whatever it is I'm doing is connected to

344
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:10,270
something that might be lured some
really great examples of some companies

345
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:15,030
that use really autonomy you are trying
to talk a little

346
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:24,639
he talks about at last and egos huge era
that last year is built by outlasting at

347
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,160
lassen has this really interesting thing
every year they look at their dads legal

348
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,710
right for the next 24 hours

349
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,880
you do whatever you gonna pay you the
only rule is you have to deliver

350
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,530
something the next day FedEx to deliver
the next day and most of their

351
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,180
innovation has come out of this little
funny pocket by giving people the

352
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,920
autonomy to choose what they want to
work on a lot of their newest features a

353
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,770
lot of their user facing up to its users
really love come out of this autonomy

354
00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:03,830
Google is famous for its 20% time but
the idea of people are tana me to solve

355
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:10,540
their problems scratch that itch scratch
and interesting it ok so how does that

356
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:15,930
relate to what I'm talking to a large
degree security programs we're trying to

357
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:20,030
build them functionally but we're
failing in the idea that I mentioned

358
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:27,810
earlier that you have even rudimentary
mental task you're successful failures

359
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:35,520
gonna drop your success rate will drop
because it's not direct its not

360
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:41,270
rudimentary actually think we'll wait a
minute is this sufficient in some cases

361
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,310
that's not easy to do

362
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:48,280
hey the guy in the phone is not
Microsoft I love my dad when he gets

363
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,990
those calls he literally since it is
easy chair yes you can walk over to his

364
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:56,600
computer just since it is chaired talks
to the guy and they almost lost it when

365
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,689
he was sitting there is like 10 minutes
into the game goes you have a Windows

366
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:06,560
computer no I have a Dell know you have
a Windows computer they're not know your

367
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:13,110
computers but the poor guy was
practically crying and the other

368
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:20,400
my dad is probably where I get my
securities but I think if we can find a

369
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:26,120
way to users some autonomy and cause
them to actually take it thinking moment

370
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:32,480
hey what does this really mean to my
urge the self-directed my job maybe

371
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,040
they'll make better choices we're going
to take the carrot and stick out of the

372
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,050
idea that you click the euro and I got
the blocking page that sort of carrot

373
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:46,540
and stick to go here you know in some in
some instances like I'm going to porn

374
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:51,759
sites or other kinds but I can't even
get to Twitter where I work like really

375
00:34:51,760 --> 00:35:02,120
Twitter for crap sake it whatever the
subject of mastery

376
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,310
we want people to master these skills
mastery is the better and better it so

377
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:13,490
how do we help users become better even
if we give them autonomy that means they

378
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:17,240
have to have some level of skill and if
they got some level of skill how to

379
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,700
increase that skill level so does the
attackers raising their bar that our

380
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:27,810
users then raise their devs raised there
were asking them I really like the

381
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,290
mastery when I work on an enterprise
application security team and when I

382
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,720
talk to developers this is how I talked
about they already have a lot of money

383
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,730
but they don't really care about
security cuz it doesn't fit into some

384
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:46,230
skills are trying to develop but if I
sell it as a hey here's this interesting

385
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,240
thing you can do when you get better and
better at it and you'll gain some

386
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,279
mystery over this thing and gain a skill
you don't already have more often than

387
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,730
not they buy into the idea so now
they've got two parts they got at least

388
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,220
one time you master

389
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,939
again with users how can we incentivize
a user so that when they do make the

390
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,780
right security forces us to security
issues that they're they're gaining a

391
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:14,640
skill level that's driving because that
bottom part is that purpose we gonna

392
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,779
have purpose from you know some of us
might have jobs kinda hate it because

393
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,859
we're stuck somewhere some of us are
very lucky to have jobs that we think

394
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:27,759
we're doing something that matters and
that's a large part of purpose even if

395
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,060
it's just a small amount of purpose how
do we get users to tap into that how do

396
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:38,009
we get developers to tap into that idea
this thing that I have control over

397
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:44,940
mastering is now connected to an end
state that I want to be continued tie

398
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:52,310
these two things together and I love it
and adding emptor we're giving them a

399
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:57,840
reason to make a positive choice so now
we're now we're getting out of this idea

400
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:03,500
I have a rudimentary task right puts a
end tab be moving down the line to make

401
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:08,790
a security choice to the reality of what
it is we're talking about a grayscale

402
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,800
here

403
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,150
hey I'm gonna go to a website I need to
find some information ok there's a link

404
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:18,150
here maybe now I hope her over and look
at the URL before actually click on it

405
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,349
or get him a little suspicious of I know
how to look into a little more and make

406
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:27,780
a decision and if I even if I think it's
a little bit off I know where I can go

407
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,650
ask someone for most of us in this room
are capable of looking at that making

408
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,109
the right decision because we're just
screen of the try to do it to people

409
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:43,410
where are you guys going into this
really awesome I'm here with told me a

410
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:49,589
great story about what he did he place
he work incentive program that's what he

411
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:53,270
did is he took the incentive program
email and he basically screens creep in

412
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:57,349
turn it into a fishing mailman sent out
the downside was that people weren't

413
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:00,950
clicking on the real mail when they got
it the company got really mad like hey

414
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,450
people are clicking on this thing that
helps them do whatever is like I'm sorry

415
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:09,259
my my point work I can fool people you
know so to some degree

416
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:18,070
we do we shot ourselves maybe a little
bit so again to those who don't know me

417
