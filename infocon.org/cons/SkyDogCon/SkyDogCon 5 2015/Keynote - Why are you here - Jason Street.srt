1
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,080
the target

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,470
the also also another first you get to
speak in my pajamas

3
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:31,779
like I'm just waking up so this talk to
you about to watch my video I recorded

4
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:38,440
part of my talk so yes I am literally
phoning it in this time

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,809
and because this is not a regular talk
because of the way a skydiver approached

6
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,699
me about it and because of the technical
limitations so I recorded something and

7
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:55,309
it turned into a rambling session that
is not what you're expecting but

8
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:01,090
nonetheless I hope you all do enjoy it
and I hope you all get something out of

9
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:06,260
it I don't know what but hopefully get
something out of it the only the

10
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,040
funniest part about it i think is the
best productive thing you can do during

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:17,740
this talk is due the drinking game you
will be drawn by the 15 minute mark

12
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,780
so go ahead and do that and I'm doing it
now anyway so you're already prepared

13
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:31,920
but that idea with no further ado role
the role the clip in introducing Jason

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,350
from the past

15
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:45,139
ok

16
00:01:45,140 --> 00:02:00,400
right this is the otherwise it's can be
awkward because this is the recorded

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:08,509
part by talk also the backup we don't
have a nice communication line to see

18
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:14,429
because that is where I am at currently
my house down there you know what i'm

19
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,500
saying is I am there we understand so
I'd like to start off with the fact that

20
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:28,930
this is going to be an unusual talk that
you're watching if not downright

21
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,280
uncomfortable because it's not a talk to
have ever given before I don't have

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,140
rehearsed so it could be a little more
disjointed try to keep it going I'm

23
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,708
trying to like just have it go through
and and be at least somewhat

24
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:51,470
entertaining you know that's what I do
so we'll see how that goes with a good

25
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,959
point is it's like if you start leaving
in your start doing it like I'll never

26
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:03,370
doubt because you know they're so yeah
but also give me an opportunity with

27
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:10,650
this talk because on this talk I'm not
able to use kitty cat pictures or by any

28
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,500
means lines to help get my message
across

29
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,890
so therefore that changed the very
fundamental of what topic I was going to

30
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:24,458
talk about and I talked to the guy talk
about it like I do wanna do a rant

31
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:30,840
ranching and it's like I do like trying
to do my whole talk with outside I think

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,860
at this point I could actually do but I
think it loses some of its not you're

33
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:44,390
not seeing that part of it as well so I
decided to go off topic off script and

34
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,750
give a different kind of talk that
you've never heard from me it's one

35
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:58,850
that's a little bit more wrong because i
dont have to see you when I'm giving it

36
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,730
to their horror it's not a talk to that
would give in public it's not talked and

37
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:11,820
I we give to actual people but it's
something that I think people need to

38
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:28,580
hear and so I'm willing to put myself
out there and give it is just quite

39
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:35,169
simply why are you here and i think
thats the first part of the talk was to

40
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,049
question I came up with and that's when
I first started it was the question I

41
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:45,520
came up with is why are you here why do
we show up to the these conferences and

42
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,490
I'm not sure why am I here why are you
here as someone who is coming to these

43
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,970
talks to participate and to be an
attendee why do you show up to these

44
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:05,560
conferences and your first one or you
know your 201 what makes us want to

45
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,570
congregate come together in this is
because you see these things like you to

46
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,680
know that I heard you like it's their
five minutes after the person finishes

47
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,470
talking so why did I think if point

48
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,100
part of what I want to talk about what's
in our culture and our community because

49
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:31,910
I think that's why you're here my least
significant moment

50
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:39,630
conference is this time right here and
this sort of interchange right now sort

51
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,010
of them

52
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:46,080
exemplifies that is just as just a
perfect example of that because this is

53
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,530
the least it's just me giving out
information telling people what I want

54
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,280
the message to come across as in what I
want them to know that i think is

55
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,260
important but I'm not getting anything
back there's no exchange of information

56
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:08,450
there's no communication there's no
connection and that is why I'm here

57
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:16,700
because all those hours before mark talk
and all those hours after my talk that

58
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:23,500
that is why I'm here because that's
right making a connection desk talking

59
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,419
to people

60
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,130
test not mean dressed up in a million
onesie giving out hugs thats people

61
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,620
coming up to me and talking to me and
telling me stories from their life

62
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:39,320
experiences are or what they learned its
me going up to people and talking to

63
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,409
them about what they've taught me what I
want to have questions i wanted to have

64
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:49,890
answered from the improved the talk that
they gave that is amazing

65
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:56,289
that's what do you convert to give you
that connection that you don't get a

66
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,580
comment on the YouTube video because
let's face it wrong number one of the

67
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,390
internet you don't Google rule 34 rule
number two of the internet you don't

68
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,419
read the comments

69
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:14,409
rule number three you never reply to the
comment will number for always remember

70
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,850
rule number 12 that's just the way it
goes so being able to actually have that

71
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,000
physical connection talk to those people
who made those talks

72
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,300
that is important that's why we go to
these conferences and that's a community

73
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,550
that one else does there need to be just
like we call it like family you know the

74
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,140
family in Psych why is that a bad thing
why is that something that you know

75
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,349
there's like a conversation like like
really only community that has that

76
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:51,620
because we're not it's like we love
being the special snowflakes except for

77
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,130
when his special snowflake blizzard so
I've been two hundred conferences I've

78
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,969
been to a shipping conference in the
Dominican Republic to the National

79
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:08,590
wholesome association in Las Vegas I've
seen other conferences and I'd seen

80
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,489
their communities I see people genuinely
happy and keeping up in keeping in touch

81
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,750
with others who only see each other
during those conferences so we're not

82
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,510
that special when it comes to that we
still have the heck of a mean that's a

83
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:29,400
great thing to have had not always
wonder there to be that community so my

84
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,449
thoughts are that's why we're here we're
here to help build a community to go

85
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:41,260
from being in the industry from being
from like this is my job my works at me

86
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,010
here mister you know because there was a
training budget and so we had the money

87
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,130
and the funds and we need to spend it so
I'm here just conference to learn things

88
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,860
that are particular to my interest to
I'm here because I want to connect with

89
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,400
others I'm here because I want to hear
what others are doing and what others

90
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:08,589
are going through and be a part of that
I want to help fix things and I'm coming

91
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:14,320
here to learn how to fix things better
or I'm here to break things and I'm here

92
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,680
to learn how to break things better it
doesn't matter is to say my deal you're

93
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,800
here because you want to make a
connection and that is an amazing thing

94
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,859
one that problems with

95
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:37,190
being in the community in being a
conference is all the people we start

96
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,140
learning

97
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:47,850
behind that keyboard is an actual person
back in the olden days you know we're

98
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:54,420
talking late eighties early nineties
when you're on the BSE's gentile your

99
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,729
your current Google that for you going
to be the assets and the IRC's you know

100
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,209
like the real IRC's

101
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:07,310
whatever there is out there now before
the snapshots in instagrams we didn't

102
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:15,420
know who was on the other side it didn't
matter if you are male or female blacker

103
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:22,469
why atheists are Christian those things
didn't matter you were someone that was

104
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,450
providing information or asking for
information or providing content or

105
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:34,230
receiving the content you were having an
exchange it was a strange of ideas

106
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,949
within social media came around and we
were able to start taking a glimpse

107
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:44,740
behind the keyboard and start seeing if
there were other people and then we

108
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,310
started reaching out and physical world
starting going to conference is starting

109
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:55,500
having this conference has come up we
got to start meeting these people and

110
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:02,550
that isn't great thing but we still
don't equate the fact that will we see

111
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:08,649
those snapshots on the internet we see
that snapshot at the conference we're

112
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:24,680
not seeing the person that person in
real life I i personally I go through

113
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,199
and I look at my facebook timeline and I
look at my twitter stream and I see my

114
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:34,130
post and there are times where I've
actually taken a step back and going

115
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:44,240
wow that looks amazing looking back I
why should I be that guy because that

116
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,960
life is at my life that's not who I am
that's a representation of who I am but

117
00:11:51,960 --> 00:12:01,220
it's not me it's like me is not exciting
or fun me is not you know the median 10

118
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,370
the awkward hugs there's so many
different facets and those are fun fast

119
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:13,000
and all of some of them are dark so more
depressing some of them are bad some of

120
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:22,180
them were just you know human as we
don't see that hard but recently I've

121
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,729
come to the point where I started
interacting with more these people

122
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,380
because of these conferences and
reaching out into this community I had

123
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:39,870
people reach out to me who've come up
with the issue today had that feeling

124
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:49,150
that they're trying to cope with
problems trying to straighten out there

125
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:55,199
trying to get through and I realized
that one of the ways that that

126
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,990
instigated was because of the fact that
I started being a little bit more honest

127
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,650
about who I am while I'm on lock some of
the problems I've come up with some of

128
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,180
the problems that I'm struggling with
and I thought this would be a good time

129
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:16,400
because i dont have to see you right now
I don't have to face the immediate

130
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:23,150
repercussions of saying these things
right now that I can say I'm your man

131
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,130
eloquent statement at Derby Conn at the
end of the talking about his depression

132
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:33,390
and what he's going through and that was
extremely brave is like that was

133
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,740
extremely touching for him to be able to
come out with an

134
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:44,350
I'm waiting for coward I'd rather hide
behind my smile and my lap then actually

135
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:50,750
had people known parts about me that
aren't as funny because it's not funny

136
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:56,770
people don't like me if i'm not the
funny humorous guy then I don't have as

137
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:03,640
much worse as I used because I've always
you know service is growing up I was

138
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,100
always taught that I had no worse it's
like I was beyond worthless and that is

139
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:22,240
something that I dealt with so I'd like
to start off with I seen over the last

140
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,660
couple months

141
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,170
other people facing this so I'm not
speaking for them I'm speaking from me

142
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:37,290
and by just like I when I'm giving a
talk on this stage where it's been with

143
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:43,060
kitty cat and in means light I tried to
give a point across I've never tried to

144
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,569
solve a problem I've never said this is
going to solve your issue I don't think

145
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,630
any other speaker can actually give one
talk to say that is going to solve

146
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:59,149
something these talks are in there to
spark conversation these talks are to

147
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:05,610
help ignite there's imaginations to
create change to create that changed not

148
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:11,240
to be the change so I have never given a
talk saying okay with this talk I thinks

149
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:20,320
this problem my talks have always been
here is my talk what do you think about

150
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,820
it what you bring to it

151
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,770
walking you take away from it and what
you leave behind is what you leave

152
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,910
behind but just take something from it
have something about you being there for

153
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:41,660
you to actually use later I'm so I don't
think this is going to be a part where

154
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,139
it's actually going to be

155
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:49,449
you are not trying to solve anything I'm
just trying to create a discussion point

156
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:55,819
I'd like this to have a discussion
because I seen too many people dealing

157
00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:02,929
with this and you deal with it privately
because every person and will ensure

158
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:09,899
dealing with it by themselves and I've
come across to people who have that than

159
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,480
have it there are doing these problems
and it can't be I just talked to someone

160
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,769
a few weeks ago and every issue they
were thinking of going through we're

161
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:26,419
almost identical to mine the same
feeling of inadequacy the same feeling

162
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:33,139
of worthlessness the same feeling that
you're in that you're going to be found

163
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:40,079
out if you talked out they were feeling
that ending was crushed me because this

164
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,399
person is someone that I look up to and
I'm like how come you think I think that

165
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:51,689
because I know I have nothing really
good to contribute a silly and stupid

166
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:58,748
jokes and laugh at that's what I offer
that's what I feel I offer how can this

167
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:02,879
person who actually contributes to our
community contribute positively to our

168
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:10,189
industry feel those things and while I
was talking to them the best way I was

169
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:17,389
able to explain joan is the way I feel a
lot of the times is that I'm on a boat

170
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:27,029
and I'm like on this ship on this dark
stormy sea and usually the boat doesn't

171
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:31,960
go anywhere i should not really stale
and every once in a while will be a good

172
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,110
currently something good will happen and
I'll get some wind in the sails and it's

173
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,850
like I know certain people are finding
this funny because it sounds like

174
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:45,939
pirates but I'm still in NJ and you see
these sales going you know Brees hit New

175
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,840
York you're sailing along you're making
progress and there are other time that

176
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,330
you get caught in your going fast and
its like men and it's just

177
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,520
you you you know you're going that
direction you don't know right direction

178
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,800
at least needing least going forward and
to you get to the point where you

179
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,169
realize that current that you're on
who's actually going around a whirlpool

180
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,950
and is just dragging you wonder and it
all depends at the point where are we

181
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:24,050
that we have to fight that current back
out to get out there were gone and

182
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,210
sometimes it's easy for me to catch
those addys

183
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,500
and figure out quickly that I'm heading
down one of those whirlpools to navigate

184
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:46,030
out about three months ago I was at the
edge I was at the brim I had a lot of

185
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:51,180
concrete cleaner on the counter next to
a bottle to bottle of Diet Pepsi that

186
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,150
was half drank I was gonna fill up the
bottle pencil because I thought it would

187
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,560
be hilarious that if you know I went out
it was through diet pepsi because

188
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,700
everybody likes to make fun about me
drinking too much Diet Pepsi that's my

189
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:17,370
humor I called some and they came over
and they kept me from going under

190
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,350
they kept me from going over the edge
that was too close to the edge of the

191
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,750
Rockville I've been in a very long time

192
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:33,560
over 20 years since I felt that way and
I'm not the only one there are a lot of

193
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:40,929
ships at sea right now and my thought is
by talking about this and spurring his

194
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:49,150
conversation maybe we can get more of
our ships closer together sorta latch on

195
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,780
send out some white lines so when we see
there's going close to that room pool we

196
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:03,530
can actually be there to help them get
back out to help catch them on the eddy

197
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:09,570
do some kind of outreach because there's
a lot of us on this ocean and the

198
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:15,450
problem is it's really dark and stormy
so we usually don't see anybody else

199
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:22,280
there's no lighthouses available as far
as I've seen but usually find another

200
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,790
person in the ocean help us out and I'm
tired of the sea nautical analogy saw

201
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,550
your welcome

202
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:38,830
basically

203
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:47,720
to this community research there's more
to this community

204
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:57,019
conferences or drama or Twitter or
Facebook for the latest on catching

205
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:08,760
what's this community is is made up our
people people who are broken people who

206
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:16,080
need help people who are giving out help
and reaching out to help it is made up

207
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:24,139
everyone that wants to see something
better that's what I believe not because

208
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:31,850
I have empirical evidence because I need
to believe it I'm trying to be one of

209
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:38,969
those people to help reach out to help
look for those other ships and help /

210
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,220
onto him and he'll pull him to safety

211
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:55,460
not because I don't think I'm a good
person I've never felt that I tried to

212
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:06,040
do what a good person would do I try to
be a better person

213
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,159
I told my daughter one time we were
having discussion cuz I had done some

214
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,720
kind of blow up or something like that
and I talked to her afterwards I told

215
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:23,150
her I was like look daddy is broken it
in my goal in my life is to make you

216
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,490
less broken than me because everybody
did you meet is broken in their own

217
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:34,350
special way some have small little
cracks through small hairline fractures

218
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:43,820
and others are just jagged pieces just
making by and that was one of the most

219
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:51,620
honest moments I've had with my daughter
so therefore naturally is probably the

220
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:59,360
saddest moments with my daughter I
believe it to be true

221
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,850
one of the reasons why I try not to
judge others and I tried not to look at

222
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:12,980
the negativity of others is not because
I'm staying tour some wonder if that's

223
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,470
what I expect from others I expect that
kind of thing and I'm trying to do

224
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:28,740
better so we can all do that we can all
understand that were flawed we can all

225
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:36,630
understand that the people that we're
dealing with are flawed no one is going

226
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:42,150
around with the answer's no matter how
and the more than a shout to the hand

227
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:49,460
the answer the less likelihood they have
the answer so but the likelihood that

228
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,309
they are trying to sell you the answer
it's not the answer

229
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:03,830
but the key and I'm gonna ended on this
rambling this I got even know if you

230
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:09,178
still listening are still there just
once again good doing it this way

231
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:18,830
start being a community because to me
that's why you're here you're not here

232
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:28,949
for me you're here for us you're not
here to just cake and learn you're here

233
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:36,419
to teach and share every single one of
you has some information has an

234
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:42,299
educational standpoint has a viewpoint
has a life experience that can help me

235
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:49,200
and my life every one of you have
something to share to others that can

236
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,970
help make someone else's life better
realize that and start sharing it look

237
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:02,789
at the people around you that come to
these conferences make the connection

238
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:08,908
make a friendship and then start
building something on it and start

239
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:18,389
making the places around you better this
world this community this whatever does

240
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:24,918
not get better by Facebook status likes
or retweets

241
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:32,110
used again on YouTube they get better
when people started actively realizing

242
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:39,949
there something wrong and tried to start
fixing it I'm here to say one simple

243
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:46,200
thing there's something wrong in our
community there's too many broken people

244
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,460
and not enough people trying to put them
back together again started

245
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,460
understanding when you have those
Twitter feeds that you're dealing with

246
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,400
another human being has problems that
you don't know about

247
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:07,590
start trying to be the good you want to
see others give to you that's what we

248
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:13,470
need to do in this community that makes
us instead of trying to deny that we

249
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:19,790
have a community was just trying to hide
that we're a family start at least

250
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:28,610
realizing that were part of a bigger
thing we're all connected though we

251
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,310
don't like to admit it and imaginary
lines on a global tells us different

252
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:42,389
we're all in this together we all have
problems that need to be fixed and a lot

253
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:49,670
of our problems are universal why can't
we start trying to fix those why can't

254
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:55,940
we start trying to make things better
and it doesn't have to be global I'm not

255
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:03,280
saying goes save the ice shelves in the
Arctic or where it left off so instead

256
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,160
of you that's one of you now jeers and
stuff you know that needs from

257
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,840
extinction

258
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,659
not those things just aren't dealing
with the things you can fix start

259
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,210
reaching out to you find out where
there's problems and where there's a

260
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,250
need and see what you can do to make it
better is not just about throwing money

261
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:27,580
at it it's not going time throwing ideas
creative cycles at it because we're

262
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:35,110
hackers how can we not come up with
solutions to make things better how can

263
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:41,560
we sit by and look at him perfect world
and not try to do something to make it

264
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,450
better

265
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,780
that's why people flying now that is the
reason why there's footprints on the

266
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:56,300
moon is because people looked and they
said let's do something else let's do

267
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,530
something better

268
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,210
now start looking at the people around
you

269
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:09,600
the people that are hurting the people
that need help start seeing them not

270
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,030
just someone that you can disagree
without the internet with someone you

271
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:28,540
could help make better I didn't say this
the best way that I could have added I

272
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:36,550
meant all of it I'm gonna break for
either question and answers you know and

273
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:43,659
discussion or go back to their rooms and
tea or whatever don't care either to

274
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:49,820
have this said to be having technical
difficulties and then you just get your

275
00:28:49,820 --> 00:29:00,110
dog back on stage to hold up I'm so
sorry about that this was not the talk

276
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:06,320
you were looking for this didn't have
the kitty cat pictures this didn't have

277
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:14,290
the character Jason presenting I'm sorry
about that from people that were coming

278
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:23,389
for that but a little bit more me and
that's not always a good thing is that I

279
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:28,970
don't think so anyway and so sorry about
that but you can get your money back and

280
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,930
I'm in China so there's that

281
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:39,770
talk to you later I will still offer
will still be that guy when you see me

282
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:50,310
next but just remember just like you
there's maybe a bit more to it than that

283
00:29:50,310 --> 00:30:52,260
still there

284
00:30:52,260 --> 00:31:54,980
hard I i still am

285
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:03,140
things also is that we get to the point
where we forget the other aspects

286
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,700
because we only see that one perception
so that's one reason why I did this was

287
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,710
to show just started discussions this
was literally the least part about it

288
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:19,690
should be about what my experience was
and just a starting order a springboard

289
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,620
to discuss everybody else is feeling
like everybody else is going on and

290
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,040
understand that ok it happens to that
we're do that maybe it's happening to

291
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,950
other people as well as myself I'm not
the only one

292
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:40,470
Josh Mar you probably can't see me
wanted to say I've been part of an

293
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:45,169
online group since I was 14 and nobody
in that groups come forward to talk

294
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:48,710
about the challenges that we all knew
there were there and about a quarter of

295
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:54,850
them are dead now so for reasons yo self
inflicted so I just wanted to thank you

296
00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:13,490
for doing this for the community I think
it's important but thank you so one of

297
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,340
the things that you talked about was
about a community and for the last

298
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:23,830
couple of years this has got a better
running trend so everybody that has a

299
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,620
little gray in their beard has started
to kind of take stock in their life and

300
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,360
review what the hell's broken in this
community and one of the reasons for

301
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,178
that i think is that this community
finally has some elders in it you know

302
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:41,470
it's relatively fresh we were all broken
that's why we form the community in the

303
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,940
first place

304
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,520
got pick you know got picked on got beat
up whatever not everybody is that person

305
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:56,059
that they were right there are several
veterans in there were lots of folks or

306
00:33:56,059 --> 00:34:01,418
not that person anymore but even you
know even the strongest of us still have

307
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:05,520
their still in over 22 minutes
somebody's gonna kill themselves that's

308
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:17,340
had a bad experience so why not do more
of this so we try when I talked why is

309
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:22,859
it still about the industry every
fucking colin is about the industry it's

310
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:26,109
no longer about everybody getting
together and wanting to learn something

311
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:32,810
or just meet some other people that may
have an interest you know I mean I come

312
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,540
here and I look for talent just as much
as anybody else that has a damn job

313
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,690
right to go hire people but at the same
time that's all I could do that you know

314
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:49,040
with my recruiting team I come here to
meet everybody and I come here to still

315
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:56,719
get new ideas just I'm kind of in awe
how everything is is about the industry

316
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,970
now so maybe you can share some opinions
on that or maybe you can just kind of

317
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,419
keep staring blankly that's kind of cool
too

318
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:16,309
they i'm sure i mean there has to be a
natural evolution of where we go along

319
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:23,400
the line that we realized that oh we can
now get paper this stuff and so I can

320
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,480
make money and I can make a livelihood
out of doing this but that means I also

321
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,109
have to act and be involved with
corporate America or corporate you know

322
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:38,279
your corporate Asia corporate whatever
it still corporate as universal suits

323
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,490
are universal but we still want to be
the cool kids we want to be the cool

324
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:51,020
kids now we want to be that the hackers
we want to be that community that we had

325
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:58,490
and started online the differences were
we still have to change it it's not it

326
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,680
doesn't have to be totally transformed
but if we want to make a living out of

327
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,960
it if we would be a career of doing this
and helping and protecting others then

328
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,890
we also have to conform a little bit to
the industry but that doesn't mean we

329
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:20,520
have to sell out or sell the way our
community so I think there's ok for both

330
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:27,339
of them to coexist and also there to be
a blending or a an exchange program

331
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:32,589
between the two every once in a while
but just remember that the community

332
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:41,828
first industry happened afterwards how
many years of going to constitute take

333
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:47,619
before you quit having the convo lose
when you got back to your real-life you

334
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:52,319
still experience summer do you know when
you you've been around a thousand people

335
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:57,170
or twenty thousand people who all like
to do the same kind of thing you do

336
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,099
do play with computers and technology in
everything and then you get back to the

337
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:05,660
house and it's everyone around you has
no clue what you're talking about you

338
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,480
know when you get that that just
depression it comes along with it you

339
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,799
still get that order to finally go away
after awhile every time it's every time

340
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:20,420
it's not not gone away the first time
that i win

341
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:27,420
to a conference was DEFCON 12 and it was
the first time that I found people that

342
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,099
like me no matter how stupid I was no
matter how ridiculous I acted I still

343
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:37,990
found friends I still found a connection
and then after a couple years after that

344
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:44,828
I started finding family and I never
really had a family before so it was

345
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:49,400
really interesting it's like I had
people that were genetically you know

346
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,049
similar to me and we coexist in the same
habitat but I had never had a family

347
00:37:56,049 --> 00:38:02,280
before and so it was really weird and it
was really new and so yeah every time I

348
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,760
come back from that conference in sight
even though it's like i've built a very

349
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,799
tight-knit group with my family now with
my wife and my two children and I love

350
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:18,900
them dearly but I've never had that
experience before I had the experience

351
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,859
of the conference still living in till
like why can't I still be around people

352
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:29,869
that actually like me being around it's
it's only at my house where a more quiet

353
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:34,549
interpreted or I get to be out there
sharing at the conference so it's more

354
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:40,030
difficult for me every time I finish
conference I get that moment of like

355
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,359
when I'm back at the computer and I'm
like Oh back on the road world I'm

356
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,990
nobody

357
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:52,660
this is ted has failed one of the things
we talked about this before it scott

358
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,670
knows this that will get on a weekly
calls that we plan for the conference or

359
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,750
something like that and heard of this

360
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:17,440
it is is that c-max but this that will
get online and that's the first that

361
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,250
I've actually like interacted with
somebody and it's even even then it's

362
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:27,430
like a video or whatever but they will
go periods as I work from home or like

363
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:33,899
my wife will literally come upstairs and
say Sweeting go to Best Buy just leave

364
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,930
the house like go do something because
we find ourselves just so tied up into

365
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,740
this you know singing and I'll get on
with them as the first social

366
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:48,180
interaction I've had in like a week and
that I think sometimes that's the route

367
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:55,290
of you know sometimes we can't get out
of her world so much to actually

368
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,180
interact with each other and sometimes
the con the reason we come in we have

369
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,950
for you here like every one of you would
probably think of me this big

370
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,779
extroverted Evans runaround have a lot
of fun but the reality is that when I'm

371
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:13,280
at home I hardly ever leave the house
and and so and i think i mean is that

372
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:22,110
resonate with anybody else maybe and so
any any input on me like with the family

373
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,430
piece of it too I know that for me
that's a huge piece when when what my

374
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:32,830
little girls come into the office I make
myself stop exactly that that that's how

375
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,069
I have to deal with it at my family

376
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:41,350
drags me out of my room not just out of
the house it's like I've got my own lab

377
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:47,640
I've got my own little world that by
domain inside my house it's alright so I

378
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,040
mean they dragged me out of the house my
daughter is often knows she always can

379
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,650
come in and talk to Daddy get my hug she
does that throughout the day which is

380
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:03,140
always great but I consciously make that
effort to say no I'm going to get up and

381
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:09,230
just walk around the street with her or
go paddling on the lake with her I'm

382
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:13,180
going to go to the mall to go to the
store

383
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:22,098
I'm gonna go to this fair or a bit
because my family wants to go it always

384
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:28,180
about wife dragged me to social things
outside of hacking conferences I told by

385
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:34,558
I'd literally told my family one time
it's like my in Houston and my in-laws I

386
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,760
said look you do understand something
the only reason why you see your

387
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:44,319
grandchildren is because your daughter
because I could care less if they ever

388
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,950
knew you or anybody in the city you
better be a bit nicer to her because

389
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,470
it's like she's the only reason why you
get to see it so I could have gone

390
00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:01,129
reason why my children know my side of
the family is because of my wife so it's

391
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:07,109
like she's the one that is responsible
for trying to keep me attached to normal

392
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:16,009
real people otherwise I wouldn't have
any contact with them at all so you know

393
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,220
we we've had different people of a
different conversations with me over

394
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:27,540
time and weather once I thought was
really interesting I had someone that I

395
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,940
spent a lot of time around it one point
in the conversation they said you know

396
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,609
what I never thought you'd actually talk
to me and I said what do you mean they

397
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:44,348
said your Sky dog and I said ok with it
what does that mean as you said you know

398
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:49,170
i i cant believe that you would actually
talk to me and I think there's this

399
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:55,460
perception you know rank and file or
something like that you know what the

400
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,819
same way everyone else does and I give
great advice it's usually punctuated

401
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:04,200
with explosives and everything else and
it may not be great

402
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,470
and it may not fit the situation every
time but you know honestly everyone in

403
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:14,828
this room everyone at DEFCON is a person
and their deal has their own crap no

404
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:18,940
matter what you know there are a lot of
people there just getting started out

405
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:24,710
and they get just absolutely ambushed by
the amount of information and the number

406
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:29,930
of people who they can actually talk to
that you know finally they can interact

407
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,560
with somebody who understands what in
the hell they're talking about you got

408
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:44,690
here gonna talk about it so so so skinny
boy originally came to the hacker

409
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:50,180
consortium by way of his mom she dropped
him off one day and he was under age or

410
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,359
whatever you know so there's a you go on
the consortium there's handguns there's

411
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:58,529
bottles of alcohol there's a playboy
land on the middle of the bands and i

412
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,680
got really sure this is the best place
for him but you know he can come hang

413
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,180
out for the day and so she came back
that afternoon and pick the mom and boys

414
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:14,379

bad pretty bad so he finally found his

415
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,530
people so she brought here contact me
can you come back next week and I didn't

416
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:24,119
say anything bad about it he he's an
absolutely great time she said you know

417
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,550
for the first time in forever

418
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:31,109
the kid came home and was happy she says
we have no idea what the fuck he's

419
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:35,790
talking about on a daily basis she said
he went to hang out with you and

420
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,869
everybody knew what he was talking about
it he was absolutely tickled can you

421
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:44,180
please come back and if anyone has been
around keyboard for a period of time you

422
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:51,598
can see how he has gone from you know
completely 30 just goofy to slightly

423
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,329
nerdy and goofy but he's you know being
around has helped him actually form

424
00:44:56,329 --> 00:45:00,390
friendships and learn how to talk to
people and and discuss things with them

425
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:05,808
and you know honestly if it weren't for
that he does having about around

426
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:09,619
more regular basis that he can talk to
so you know I get texts in the middle of

427
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:13,689
the day hey man what's going to come
over and hang out this Sunday ok sure

428
00:45:13,689 --> 00:45:18,029
and trust me love the kid like the day
is long from the moment he stepped in

429
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:21,569
the door until he gets in his car to
leave it is nothing but a

430
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:26,019
question-and-answer session about
everything I own something he's seen on

431
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:35,589
the internet but but he has nobody else
to do that we now have banned me from a

432
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:47,400
broad outlines yeah so so I think that
you know like that you know we got the

433
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,719
graybeards now I got gray in my beard
you know I think I maybe it's a light

434
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:54,359
yellow bug Rangers looks like you may
have colored I don't know you're trying

435
00:45:54,359 --> 00:46:00,239
to cheat death there no I got some great
ago when I mean we're at this point now

436
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:06,959
where you know we we as the wise elders
are looking around going you know this

437
00:46:06,959 --> 00:46:12,459
is not as fun as it was before when yeah
it sucks and we

438
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:17,799
yeah we kind of guided it that way yeah
yeah we did that and we need to fix it

439
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:25,949
but there's I mean what do we do have a
one eight hundred number i mean that's a

440
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:30,170
difficult proposition and how we
actually fix it its most likely as just

441
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,650
having to turn around to somebody and
say hey man how's it going you know the

442
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:37,809
new guy that shows up and he he may be
full of talent or he may be the most

443
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:42,630
broken person on the planet this may be
his last chance to find someone who can

444
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,270
understand him

445
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:49,920
hang out with him you will always find
me at every conference in the lobby

446
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,980
level and hanging out with any person
that there I try to make sure that

447
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,260
that's one thing I like about the Opera
House is that it makes me more

448
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:05,200
approachable hi I am never and I've
never tried myself someone I still

449
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,640
freaked out when people that I see up
giving talks actually know my name that

450
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:16,339
still weirds me out a little bit it's
just amazing it's like I'm like whoa

451
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:23,000
that's not how I remember somebody
special it's like I i wanna be just a

452
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,700
person that comes to a conference to
learn to network to be there and and I'm

453
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,359
learning from not just the people that
are standing on the stage I'm learning

454
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,240
from a lot of smart people that are
shelling up to these conferences to

455
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,009
learn as well and that's where it
happens so there should always be

456
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:47,530
networking should always be be never be
afraid to talk to anybody not just

457
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,750
because but also other attendees the
people that you still see with you that

458
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,740
there in that room with you it's like
they have something in common

459
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:02,740
Jason my main comment on something for
you specifically said a couple of times

460
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:07,620
you're not something special you are you
get on stage you say things we all want

461
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:12,009
to hear and honestly my kids many things
have used one of his heroes he came home

462
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:17,010
from two years in a row I want to be
like Jason street so there's a thirteen

463
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:20,830
year old in my house he thinks you're
the coolest thing in the world so just

464
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:26,440
know that now you are you are something
special thank you and I think there's

465
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:33,250
three things at play here one is grew up
because of community computers we found

466
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,980
each other and that community is
changing and that's the hard part is

467
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,600
another generation coming along and they
have their own ideas about what's going

468
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,020
to happen for us what we did and whether
we want it to or not

469
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,570
communities gonna change and that's true
all communities throughout history and

470
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:52,380
if we continue to try to hold onto some
visions of the past

471
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:56,650
past it's only going to her instead of
trying to figure out how do we bring

472
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:02,150
these new people and make something new
in the future and that goes along with

473
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:07,990
what was largely what we do is between
your ears you know it's it's what's

474
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:13,258
happening in the gray space grey matter
of our heads not so much as a group and

475
00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:18,660
the reason that cause like this happen
as human beings we haven't need to be

476
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:24,509
around people whether it's 10 people or
20,000 def

477
00:49:24,509 --> 00:49:30,410
we have a need to connect and IRC feared
Twitter whatever the hell it is doesn't

478
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:35,180
doesn't cut it we've actually got to get
in physical space with one another and

479
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:41,339
have to do so in the bottom line from
that for me is I come to this stuff

480
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:50,509
because you guys give me a place to do
what I can't do by myself

481
00:49:50,509 --> 00:49:56,039
we're really gonna later later really
talked about what you do in your

482
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:08,640
basement alone but while

483
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,129
I'm not gonna go on a social justice
campaign cuz that's a bunch of bullshit

484
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:23,900
but the core of this problem is a lack
of diversity it's not just a lack of

485
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:29,549
diversity you know middle aged white guy
sindrome or anything like that it's a

486
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:38,259
lack of diversity in input we focus on a
single area a lot of us has started to

487
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:44,010
talk about let's just go read a fucking
beach house and or you know get a cabin

488
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,730
where there is no god damn reception and
see what happens then you know really

489
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:52,920
have an actual social experiment where
you can stare at your fucking phone you

490
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,640
can stare at a screen we might actually
have to talk or figure something out as

491
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,529
a shitload of us that like other things
other than technology and can have real

492
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:08,190
conversations about that I mean I like
what I really like motorcycles I like

493
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:13,369
guns and a lot of us like we can talk
all day about that should there's a lot

494
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:17,230
more that we can talk about other than
guns and computers though and there's a

495
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:22,339
lot that we could do to bring other
people into this community to share with

496
00:51:22,339 --> 00:51:28,349
them there are people that are you know
gun nuts motorcycle nuts whatever

497
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:31,359
there's people that are just like us
that are sitting around here going you

498
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:39,180
know what we need something more to keep
this going so maybe there should be a

499
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,240
bit more outreach to other groups that
are you know like minded there are

500
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,910
plenty of people that reminds that in
this world that don't talk to hackers

501
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:59,740
take money I'm come on let's that's
that's a self-imposed label you know I

502
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,879
like to break things I like to fix
things like to go out and adventurer and

503
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:10,279
explorer and ultimately that's what we
are is a bunch of explorers well I tell

504
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:16,619
people you call me a hacker now but two
hundred years ago you called us and

505
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:19,710
dinners you called us creators

506
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:25,180
it's like the terminology changes but
what we are never change where people

507
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,009
that go out and we try to make things we
try to make things but we try to explore

508
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:34,540
we try to create we try to shape the
world around us that's never changed

509
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:41,470
just the label the ideas that you look
back at the concept of a renaissance man

510
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:46,970
is someone that is not locked themselves
in their basement to work a singular

511
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:52,830
project for their entire lives you know
for God's sake

512
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,290
a lot of us have kids and everything
else I went out and I for me anyway so I

513
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,580
know this farm stuff you know if you
know what the FAA's that's great I'm

514
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:07,859
very proud of you but my kids got to see
a cow being bored at the York fair and

515
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:14,839
it was fucking awesome you know and the
other part about that is like WoW and

516
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:18,299
look at all this technology in
agriculture and that's interesting I

517
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,150
wonder what else I could do with all
this stuff and it brings all that stuff

518
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,990
together for this but my point being
there are people that you never think to

519
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:29,910
talk to that are I was at a farmers
market in Bloomington and an Amish guy

520
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,890
so my Linux t-shirt and started talking
to me about colonel stuff

521
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:52,940
what's it like is not appropriate he has
a fucking addiction you how much would I

522
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:58,289
i bought versus all doubts I'm that guy
there was an engine block heater might

523
00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:02,250
buy it back out getting out of my house
but there is a lot of wood in my house

524
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,029
still because of because he has no room
in his house because he has all the

525
00:54:07,029 --> 00:54:16,230
other would

526
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:29,210
trying to be polite so I think one of
the things that struck me is that yes

527
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:34,470
this community is very intimidating to
people who first come out I think a lot

528
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:42,189
of that has to do with its community
sees itself as being a meritocracy which

529
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:46,680
it is in a way it is in a way the
problem is that it encourages people to

530
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:54,279
create persona and that is isolation and
I think one of the things that jason is

531
00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:00,150
trying to do here is to drop some of
that isolationism thank you

532
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:07,630
so there are other factors at work which
caused isolation as well but I think

533
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:08,960
this is a big one

534
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,950
and one of the reasons why I like the
smaller cars is that it is easier to to

535
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:24,970
break that kind of stuff down so thats
so the downside Jason because you're in

536
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:30,540
Beijing you're gonna miss out on the fun
because after this we're gonna actually

537
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:34,160
break for dinner and go get some grub
hopefully about you know pilot cars and

538
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,299
go and then when we come back in the
evening from nine o'clock to 11 or

539
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:44,140
whenever we decided to get shut down by
the hotel is lounge con we're just gonna

540
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:50,200
kick listen to some tunes and shoot the
ball and talk shop you know what you're

541
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,470
playing with it the house what new ideas
you have and just hang out and have a

542
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:58,959
good time and we're gonna miss you not
being here so next year you're in charge

543
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,609
of lounge con you have to have your ass
here in Nashville ok I'll be there

544
00:56:03,609 --> 00:56:10,259
actually anything else for us know I
might actually it's starting to get more

545
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,130
daylight out there are about to be now
and I gotta go start the day with a

546
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:20,660
couple of meetings and we'll get some
computer parts cool very cool I want to

547
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:24,480
say thank you for doing this is an
absolutely wonderful talk and it took a

548
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,480
lot of balls to do it and it's going to
be on the internet so you're screwed

549
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:35,900
shaking literally like that the camera
