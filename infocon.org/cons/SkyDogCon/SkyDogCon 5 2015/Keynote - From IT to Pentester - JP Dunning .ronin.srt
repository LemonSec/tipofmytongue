1
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:33,650
thanks everybody for coming to the
second track for the sioux skylark on

2
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:40,559
this is my first time attending so I'm
really excited my handles Ronan and this

3
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,739
talk is from i to the pen tester and
anything just as in the room I dot down

4
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:52,290
the sideline in Miami but it's really
hard to see down there

5
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,670
ok well next time I put this together
and make it actually legible I won't

6
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,430
read the whole thing but it's really
funny and you guys would have laughed if

7
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:08,070
you could have been able to read it did
start a little bit about me so then this

8
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,360
presentation will be walking through my
kind of my advice and the advice that's

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,100
been given to me about getting into
security various forms but specifically

10
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,729
talking about becoming an offensive
security tester

11
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:31,860
realizing a lot to my path and trying to
give advice based on what other people

12
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,570
have told me as well but my journey of
my way was not the only way and I'm

13
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,080
hoping to cover cover that in here but
for me I've been in security for about

14
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,330
10 years now I guess I started doing
research as an undergrad went to grad

15
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,120
school started hanging out at
conferences and writing some tools and

16
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,000
this is all before I was even in the job
market for those still in academia and

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,440
then since then for the past five years
I've been doing penetration testing

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:13,959
along with other side security related
projects Georgia seven behind me and i'm

19
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:21,260
kind of way to be jumped at this point
so my handle is run in JP as well you

20
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,810
can find out there

21
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,130
he just doesn't get high enough for
things not to be throwing numbers out of

22
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:38,900
it that's not gonna show up in the audio
but I just had a duty behind me lurking

23
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,440
just called this the lurkers

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,690
guess you're right I can trust you guys
are definitely Thomas something's gonna

25
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:55,260
be so where are you now that was a very
brief about me and give some more

26
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,870
references throughout the presentation
but if you're at this talk you live

27
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,870
there fell asleep in the last one and
carried through or you're actually

28
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,849
interested in potentially moving into
the security field which I would hope so

29
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:17,730
because there is a vast open field of
jobs that are unallocated right now that

30
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,548
people are trying to get into and this
is an excellent job talk about how you

31
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:25,920
can make money above I'm very much I
believe that if you're going to be doing

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,720
this you have to be very passionate
about it so that's the the avenue that I

33
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,810
want to encourage people on is using
your passion to get into this field but

34
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,630
we'll start with where are you now and
and you can be anywhere and this round

35
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,780
if this is kind of what you are feeling
and this points in your job career then

36
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,269
maybe it's time for a change and that
change might happen to be going into

37
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:54,230
securities cos I'll be honest it's a lot
of fun and you get to change around what

38
00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:00,429
you do a lot makes everyday pretty
interesting so you know I mean c'mon

39
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,819
guys have seen the show if you haven't
seen the show if it doesn't matter you

40
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,700
have a help desk which I have so it just
instilled in me what's what's the

41
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,850
automatic response for helped us as the
caller that called as the I T support

42
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,409
what should you always say before you
even hear the question now

43
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,350
now well if you want to keep your job

44
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,990
the wrong response to keeping your job
that's a friends call you a friends call

45
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,639
you then you can respond that way what's
the real response

46
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:38,249
turning it off and turning on again yes
and then somebody told me they have now

47
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:42,419
started saying have you tried turning
off and on again three times just just

48
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,340
additional call me back later time to
wait around and then see if the problem

49
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,248
resolves itself so a lot of people in
there are in the technical support

50
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:56,389
filled with the help desk or keeping
systems up and running

51
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:01,789
there's a lot of you know technical
background lot of developers also and in

52
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:09,068
the room I'm sure who began a lot of my
slider gonna be home base film film buff

53
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,349
so if you've never seen office space you
should make your life seemed just that

54
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:17,639
little bit better and less and less
unless she's at your office I mean it

55
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,860
could be possible that you have
approximate of somebody always something

56
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,250
you sound like somebody has a case of
the Mondays

57
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,409
ministry which a lot of people getting
these two confused right if you've ever

58
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:35,139
been Asus administrator than your this
and if you're a developer to your

59
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:40,589
friends your this doesn't necessarily
mean that they overlap but you could

60
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:44,449
also be a biologist so we have a lot of
technical people in the crowd but not

61
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:49,129
all of us have gone down the path of
having technical jobs and I understand

62
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,659
some people are still in school when I
get to that a little later but you don't

63
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:57,620
necessarily have to be able to you know
how the fundamentals I T or technical

64
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,409
background in your job you conduct have
this as a hobby and a lot of people

65
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:07,430
almost everybody who got into this field
it started as a hobby whether they

66
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:13,849
applied that hobby at work or in their
own free time in some other way they can

67
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:18,360
do anything anything else you know you
you can't go home again this is maybe a

68
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,529
more obscure reference if you just seem
Jim Carrey showing his nipple through a

69
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,719
jail cell that is the cable guy which
you either would love him as a movie or

70
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:35,639
really hate for you to pop star and yes
everybody you're welcome you have been

71
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,969
visually rick rolled

72
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:43,039
this little dog go everywhere and I
realize I had on his shirt and I'm like

73
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,779
wait what really screams like early
early nineties late eighties will when

74
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,649
it come out on his heels like smashing
nobody here knows ok I decided that

75
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:58,819
hearing was probably the exact
replacement for mid-eighties wonder when

76
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:05,379
they become a thing I know it's really
old I mean some people money but it was

77
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:10,110
a thing like eight years ago

78
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,839
matter where you where he might want to
move into this I T security feelings

79
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,199
again it's a lot of fun you can do a lot
of interesting things with it and you've

80
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,969
watched hackers the new venue like
that's definitely how it really works I

81
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:25,769
would like to do that because it's very
realistic there's a lot of swirling vine

82
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:30,209
things and and equations flow across my
screen every day I can't I can't even

83
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:37,129
keep track of all of them so this point
you have the choice of red red red or

84
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:41,800
blue pill and I like to think everybody
here is kind of already chosen a path

85
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,699
because you had a security conference
right you you started down the rabbit

86
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:50,569
hole already but also with the site I
like that you have the choice of either

87
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:55,519
getting in time to security or not or
you got their red red team and blue team

88
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,229
side of it so you know you've got one
side that the offensive security and

89
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,839
you've got the one side the defense of
security and you can go down either path

90
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,469
it seems like you know the more
entertaining side is the offensive side

91
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:11,979
but it's way easier if you want to
challenge yourself don't do that

92
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,659
defensive side cuz you know when I make
a new system I basically get to say oh

93
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:22,089
you had it right 99.9% the time I got in
that way it's broke and I got whatever

94
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:27,309
dropping my come out good luck fixing it
and then they have to spend the next six

95
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:29,309
months to a year

96
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,740
patching it or figure out if they need
to implement something else on the

97
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:39,669
network that's fundamental change from a
lots a huge headache but it is it is

98
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,919
kind of you get to control your
environment more so the other side of

99
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,460
that is you kind of have you know your
friend of mine told me the phrase of

100
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,600
our job is to tell people their babies
ugly which sounds horrible but it kinda

101
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,490
is because it's you know when it's when
you are the person in charge of the

102
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,720
security your it's a baby it's it's what
you know you've put together you put a

103
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,110
lot of sweat and tears into this your
domain or euro area network and

104
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,480
sometimes you get a lot of leeway and
find a lot of places to give leeway into

105
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,610
it

106
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,810
get a lot more locked on environment
hiring people that know what they're

107
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,160
doing but on the red team side you've
got the offensive you the guy going in

108
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,160
that's either breaking yet or testing it
in some way kind of got forensics I

109
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,510
don't know where exactly people feel
that that that lives but that's also

110
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:37,410
it's kind of in between area we're not
exactly trying to break into something

111
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,449
but you're doing the cleanup afterwards
you have to be knowledgeable about both

112
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,120
sides of the fence and I think those
guys are way smarter than me as I get to

113
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,270
I know the path that I've gone down on
testing but they have to follow a path

114
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,270
based on like one or two flags that
they've already these things happen here

115
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:02,490
is our network figure out everything
else so those are your options I mean

116
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,370
that's the general broad strokes kind of
the options you can go down and that

117
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,820
here's some steps that I would recommend
you take how many people do the

118
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,370
contesting that are in the room here now
I've got a few so I want to open up at

119
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,730
the end for your advice as well cuz I
realize I'm giving sort of my advice and

120
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,860
it could be wrong and so during the
presentation steps but in the end I have

121
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,050
some time I want some Q&A but I
appreciate if you guys would fare when

122
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:39,150
you to send your experience because a
lot of it it's not a very easy path

123
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:44,350
that's a direct path is no there's no
single line to get there and college is

124
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,820
a big part of that so I know a lot of
jobs in the market

125
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,310
you go to college and you step into this
degree path and then you can get these

126
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,550
jobs over here for this degree path you
can get these jobs over here there's no

127
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,969
real degree path for what we do

128
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,860
as far as I know there are a lot of
schools out there that do security it

129
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,000
but they predominately focus on
defensive while there some classes you

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,389
on often security as far as I know and I
try to keep up with it

131
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:20,639
there are many of the just focus on how
to test something offensively or even

132
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,920
like a full four-year degree on
forensics there are a lot of other

133
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,319
classes out there and and associates
degrees and stuff in forensics as well

134
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:35,740
but as far as offensive goes I haven't
seen you may degrees back on IMEI I did

135
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,069
I went to school for computer science
and a master's in computer science as

136
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:45,259
well which was great I personal train
because in grad school I got to do

137
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:48,329
research and that's the only reason I'm
in this field today is because I had

138
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:51,849
time in school where I was like ok I
don't have all the stuff that I don't

139
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,939
have a job down have all this other
stuff going on it's an encouraging

140
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:59,410
environment for me to push out these
tools or do my own research and

141
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,300
everybody there was very supportive so
that was kind of how I got into the

142
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,479
field was volunteering to do some
security research and then kind of

143
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,809
forking off and doing my own security
research and graduate school really

144
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:15,980
expanding upon that and actually being
able to release some of the research

145
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,339
that i dun like I wrote some tools
during the course of those two years

146
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:28,660
that kind of got the ball rolling for me
in the field but that being said do you

147
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,490
need college to get a job in this area

148
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:39,389
no you don't I have many friends either
you know left college or never went to

149
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:44,089
it you know went straight from high
school into some sort of I T job and

150
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:50,559
focus their way over here focus their
way into security or happened into it a

151
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,199
lot of people just was like actually
happened into the position cuz it was

152
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,059
avoided they just when they were pulled
out of the hat to say you're now doing

153
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:04,509
the security check for this job but if
college doesn't feel like the right fit

154
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:07,430
for you it's not a requirement

155
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,430
there's a talk tomorrow on

156
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,630
resume and I don't know either than than
the the brief description that was

157
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,680
online I don't know a lot about it so
I'm not gonna go whole lot into that

158
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,339
side but we're kind of looking at at the
resume side as well a little bit and so

159
00:13:24,339 --> 00:14:00,590
college just look good on a resume if
you're looking at a chart yeah

160
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,790
great point so it's not it's not
checking the box right it's not saying

161
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,860
college done it's going to college
because that's what you want to do and

162
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,980
you want to learn from their cause if
you're just gonna coast through like you

163
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,110
might do in high school and not retain
anything that you get out there and it

164
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,430
you know you have to relearn everything
that they would hire you to do something

165
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,829
I i didnt hard enough but that's a great
point that you should use it as an asset

166
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,550
if it's an asset that you want to
acquire some college having a four-year

167
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,709
degree a two-year degree going on
further than that it's really because

168
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,820
you have the personal motivation that
this is what you want to do in the end

169
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,960
or you know in college college is no
idea but if its potential path if you

170
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,380
think about going back to college for it
and just to get that check box and just

171
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:49,570
to look good on a resume I wouldn't
recommend it if it's just again as a

172
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,430
booster cuz that's a lot of money and
time spent where I could probably be

173
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,969
spent better somewhere else but if you
are in college I would say absolutely

174
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,480
try to get in on research because that's
a very collaborative environment in

175
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,570
general so try to look out for research
project posed around even as an

176
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,170
undergraduate go to professor and they
have an idea for this you know maybe get

177
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,599
some credit or maybe you can help me out
maybe I can have some lab space I

178
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,170
started as an undergrad doing research
and you know had my own space organism

179
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,750
shared space but I had you know a desk
and that really helped me sort of focus

180
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,220
on their research while I was there and
I find that a lot of academia they love

181
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,690
it

182
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,100
professors cuz if you publish something
out of it they get their name on it no

183
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,210
matter what even if they'd only read one
ended of it they love that kind of thing

184
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:43,520
so if you are in college take advantage
of that time because you get to pick up

185
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,540
project that you're passionate about and
you get a lot of resources available to

186
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:56,829
you so using your current job so your
system administrator I did that for a

187
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,579
little while between grad and undergrad
I was a sysadmin for

188
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:06,899
department on campus and that was great
for me as I got to use small network but

189
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,869
it was mine and I was the one in charge
of it so as long as everything

190
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,769
maintained well I might have some free
time and nobody was really you know

191
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:18,329
limiting what I could do in this network
so I started playing around with some of

192
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:22,829
the tools that I really only read about
getting to live environment little later

193
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:28,349
on but in my case I can start you know
play within that alot whereas I read

194
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,699
about it before and I might have run
wanted to scan these homes and basic

195
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,868
stuff and I had a little bit more free
rein to say and map not harmful and

196
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:40,379
general your bosses will say yes or
whoever your supervisor is like okay if

197
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,569
it's part of your job in a little bit
you play out that a lot cuz its

198
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:48,110
non-intrusive zewe used to how to use
the tools you know if you're looking at

199
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,779
configurations I wasn't trying to buy
windows demands through Active Directory

200
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,259
or all the settings and see what they
did and what I could apply in a reading

201
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:00,860
up about them trying to change something
if it broke anything late at night when

202
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,089
it's not going to cause an issue but
really if if you're in any sort of field

203
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:11,099
at work that relates to potentially
related security even if it's not your

204
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,609
job description it's worth stepping out
because people are always looking for

205
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:21,000
the security guru of the team as if
something happens or something of

206
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,839
questions come into their vendors come
in they want kind of lead person and

207
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:33,428
even if your job title is not like lead
whatever or team lead they might look to

208
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:36,169
you and I think a lot of people as I
mentioned before a lot of people that I

209
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,620
know that's that was their path of
something happened and they needed

210
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,870
someone to step up to be the security
guy and even if you know they know as

211
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,580
much about jobs anybody else they were
like yeah sure that sounds interesting

212
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,370
I'll you know I might spend a few extra
hours at night looking into it or I'll

213
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,689
add that onto my plate while at work and
you know step-by-step there you can

214
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,760
build up until they're like wow we
actually need somebody to fill a

215
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,899
full-time position like you've been
doing this for the past six months

216
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:08,729
you on our guy but it doesn't have to be
you know technical job even if you again

217
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,779
if your not that technical support if
you're not there

218
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:18,509
developer sysadmin you know if you make
friends with them and you have your you

219
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:24,710
know maybe your local system or you can
support them people like getting help it

220
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,889
works if you can prove yourself worthy
of being like a nice I know about you

221
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:33,080
know these things over on our web
servers work would you mind if I try to

222
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,449
do some testing for you might save you
some money despite higher than the

223
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,169
outside consultant to come in

224
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,700
nobody wants to look bad so you can be
the guy that's like looking as part of

225
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,139
my job but I know how to do this stuff
if it's cool with you I'll do some

226
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:48,968
initial testing and look around and see
if I can find some stuff that you can

227
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:53,509
fix before outside auditors or your boss
takes a look at it and you know you

228
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:58,269
might get in trouble there's a lot of
things that you can do the issue is you

229
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:02,080
are having to go above and beyond so he
might be adding more to your place

230
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,599
instead of directly changing over to a
new job you're essentially doing more

231
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:11,330
work but it it's very rewarding that
that year later or something when you're

232
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,299
able to say no I've got the skill set in
my back pocket something I might not

233
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:23,059
have been able to acquire while well my
normal job on the flip side if there's

234
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:26,950
no way in hell you can actually get that
scenario working for you that's also

235
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:32,460
fine golden lab which doesn't have to be
quite as extensive as Tesla's lab which

236
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,539
probably cost lots of money today
building a lab is very very cheap

237
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:41,320
because we have virtualization so your
lab environment in general can be a

238
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,599
couple of raspberry PI's or your laptop
running free virtual machines which the

239
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:55,210
software is free a lot of the election
for free you can make your way into a

240
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,309
Windows license or even copy for
temporary use or something like that

241
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:05,109
there are a lot of articles out there
and guides I friend of mine gave a talk

242
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:10,668
last year but I started on at a
conference aid in West Virginia and his

243
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,419
entire talk with how to setup VMware and
it without citing the body was like

244
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:18,820
initially I was like I you know I don't
it's not a big talker I don't really

245
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,320
need and want to hear it and the cloud

246
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,678
crowd was really engage because that's
that's one of the best steps you can do

247
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,120
is learn how to setup this testing
environment and the first up to that is

248
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,539
VMware so if you have to spend hours and
hours and hours but not as VMware that's

249
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:41,289
fine because after you get that initial
setup going shopping in virtual machines

250
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:48,639
you're learning how to interact with
these tools and my experience I had 11

251
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:52,729
Christmas break in college where I went
home and this being the backcheck times

252
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:58,399
I look for every tool set up my own
virtual machine and I was going through

253
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:02,658
every tool that I saw in the the
backtrack framework that I could fine so

254
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:05,899
just clicking on their menu looking at
this sort of tool saying it's all in the

255
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:06,570
game

256
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,918
opening it up looking at the man page
for the help file looking at online

257
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,909
which took a considerable amount of time
and was boring and it wasn't actually

258
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:18,799
manual testing anything but in in my lab
environment I was learning the space

259
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,340
which is almost as important as learning
tools how to use them I'm constantly

260
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,928
referencing guides for tools I haven't
used the new year but I know that I know

261
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,879
where to go for it a lot of its knowing
where to get the information not

262
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:34,769
necessarily retaining it if you have
your lab environment you run it once you

263
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,840
might run it you know four years later
but you can never attain ok we know this

264
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,490
is to exploit that or if I need to test
the specific particular vulnerability

265
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll go over here so I don't focus on
specific names of of tools trying to go

266
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,639
abroad I know I know mentioned backtrack
before because that's kind of the most

267
00:21:56,639 --> 00:22:01,059
popular interesting distribution there's
a lot of other ones out there and I

268
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:06,200
suggest you look into them as well but I
think for learning purposes initially

269
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,040
was a lot of reference material for
backtrack and now Cali

270
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,720
to use and there's a lot of a lot of
guys they're they're step process made a

271
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,560
very simple for beginning this is I even
if you don't buy any equipment all you

272
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,450
can set this up in your personal laptop
using VMware or VirtualBox I like the

273
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,430
VirtualBox personally but both of them
will will be supported as a virtual

274
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:36,470
systems and just you know playground
practice you've got your lab setup now

275
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,340
and I need to practice again this is the
dedicated time outside of work this

276
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,459
isn't getting paid for this year

277
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,100
you missing out on time with friends or
whatever but you've got swear that my

278
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,409
office at home looks pretty similar to
this

279
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,650
various reasons but but you know you
have a lot of the printouts and stuff

280
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,700
it's good luck for me personally I like
to print stuff out as reference manual

281
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,540
sometimes especially if it's like
material then I'm going through the 26

282
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,080
stances that considering on the screen
printing out highlight it put it on the

283
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,590
shelf and occasionally bring it back up
especially for more detail materials but

284
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:20,780
the hours and walking through all the
toolset we have the offensive side tools

285
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,000
as well as the defensive side tools out
there so there are virtual machines that

286
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
are designed to be attacked and that's
fine because they are residing on your

287
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,670
personal lab do not get in trouble for I
just don't let the traffic leave your

288
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,510
network and you can do pretty much
anything you want so you have all the

289
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,650
stuff hosted locally you can carry out
the UIM but frequent I love to get a

290
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,140
coffee shop to get out and do something
and focused so you can actually be

291
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,460
hacking your own p.m. at a coffee shop
because you don't have to get on the

292
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,020
wireless which is kind of fun and
interesting to do also pertain to this I

293
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,050
don't have a specific slide on it

294
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:01,020
unfortunately you have to learn the next
season just know there's no other way

295
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,080
around your house to learn how to use
Linux to a certain extent so I should

296
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,949
probably back up a little bit and done
talking about all the tools to download

297
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,760
interact with with learn Linux first so
setting up a virtual machine what I did

298
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,920
was basically forcing myself years ago I
put Linux as my host system and then

299
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,279
just bored with it

300
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,700
I had to figure out why things kept
crashing out to learn about dependencies

301
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:40,550
yeah

302
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:46,760
his suggestion is probably more
reasonable one was to install it on a

303
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,000
virtual machine and I i did that and
then I ignored it

304
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,330
which people might be more motivated
than I was

305
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,520
to learn this stuff some virtual machine
is the same way to go for me it was

306
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,730
either I install it on my host or I'll
never touch it again and so I did a dual

307
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,200
boot with Windows and Linux and then I
just like i know if i cant get it done

308
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,680
in the next move over or you can
virtualize the window side but I have to

309
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,980
get it done here have to get it done
here to figure out a way whatever it is

310
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,620
too and this was years ago it's a lot
easier now and I have you know I use

311
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,110
Linux at home a lot you've got
alternates 22 office you've got

312
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,100
alternates to watching videos and you've
got the web browsers are the same so the

313
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,459
support level now is is very similar but
you can't just interact with the GUI

314
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:38,060
clicking away you're not doing it right
you have to open up that scary command

315
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,629
prompt and learn what things are and we
do have done some training before and a

316
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:47,410
lot of the times when I'm delivering
training the first several pages are the

317
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:52,940
basics of how to interact with a Linux
command line because you know you've got

318
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,570
10 commands you can start off with your
learning a little bit about the file

319
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,320
system and then gradually add on to them
and you get awesome advance but using

320
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,620
said grab a knock and you feel awesome
cause you're creating your own sword

321
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,709
which sounds really boring sorting data
is is really exciting when you get it to

322
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,430
work right as a huge nerd again that
that's not really enticing to be like no

323
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,730
coming to pen testing you get to sort
data well but if it's true you you get

324
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:23,630
to interacting with the command line you
can create your own tools but your own

325
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,430
methods of doing things very quickly and
easily

326
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,200
whereas if you had to do this in Windows
8 the tools are there . there's barely

327
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,780
anything and so on and when does cause
it's hard to attract with Andy good luck

328
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,090
customizing and pointed out of something
and a lot of the job is do this task

329
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,550
getDataBack store the data so you can
use it to exploit something over here so

330
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,300
you can't just always use the tools
they're so learning Linux command line

331
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,520
is a must and if you can do in
virtualize that's awesome I had to the

332
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,510
painstaking process

333
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,920
pouring it on my own which against a lot
easier now but practice with that

334
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,770
outside of security could just use it
everyday interactions setting up email

335
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:10,840
there are a lot of publications out
there lot of books about hacking

336
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,540
security pin dusting whatever read them
they're available at your local

337
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,540
bookstore these are things that I like
underground books you have to find on

338
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,580
sketchy websites that are self-published
blah blah blah I know all this stuff is

339
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,010
gone very very mainstream there's
nothing in there obviously there's an

340
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:34,190
underground but there's a lot of
mainstream material out there and a lot

341
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:40,700
of these books i dont is this real book
actually I thought I found it on the

342
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,800
internet so I don't believe that is true
it is true it is well I'm not

343
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,370
specifically talking about this book
this was just an example that I found

344
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,290
that I thought was modified and it's
really it's real but there's there are a

345
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:00,409
lot of books out there and a lot of them
since I'm general-purpose ones which I

346
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,950
would recommend as your first book kind
of finding London's like what online and

347
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,560
then there's a lot specific ones like
you know wireless or hardware social

348
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:18,649
engineering or like medicine book on
that I read and probably six or seven of

349
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:23,770
those books before I got a job in the
field are as as I progress I i cycle

350
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,530
back through them but they were great I
mean I know I considered almost like

351
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,710
being in a class in school if that war
the book that I learned off of that

352
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,340
could definitely definitely teach an
entire course out of a lot of these

353
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,310
books and again with your lab
environment setup you can actually test

354
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,889
some of these tools because at least for
me reading it is great but you know you

355
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,590
really get instilled in you when you're
able to run the tool against something

356
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,310
even if nothing great happens you don't
get in you your cycling through your

357
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,070
practicing more and more they're not
that expensive and you can find them you

358
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,530
can Amazon is great for local bookstores
yeah

359
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:10,500
I'm trying to stay away from from my
exact favorites but there I'm my vice

360
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,120
Amazon just looking for some some sites
look at the book ratings I would save a

361
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,610
lot of them are pretty accurate I find
that personally I don't go back and

362
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,310
reference them as much anymore cuz I'm
doing it but I but at the time I mean I

363
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,899
was like to highlight book so I was
flipping through and highlighting all

364
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,000
the command line version that's an
important notes about that this I think

365
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,870
a lot of the general-purpose ones I
don't know if there are any of that I

366
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:45,409
would say are bad out there maybe I just
seven Rodney

367
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:58,990
trying to call me out I read gutter sir
i i went through some of the hacking

368
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:05,680
exposed series the only reason I mention
those is because they they're one of the

369
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,640
few that are kind of a series of books
that cover a wide variety of things I do

370
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,860
a lot of wireless so I also did some of
the several other wireless books arrive

371
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:22,540
early ones they have hacking spose
Wireless there's some other ones that

372
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,690
I've read these social

373
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:33,539
the display book

374
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:38,408
fictional books

375
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:42,639
hackers the movie is probably that was
my fictional book now I know there's

376
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:46,959
there's actually there are a lot of
books out there that do reference this

377
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,159
kind of stuff and some of them are very
Hollywood like against swirling you know

378
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,950
numbers across the screen

379
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,129
some of them do actually reference real
things I recently read ready player one

380
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:01,478
anybody's read that it's a good general
book it's an it's an awesome book by the

381
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:05,789
way but they have a few small references
to these kind of things in there I can't

382
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:28,550
think of any specific fictional books
that there are a series

383
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:35,030
he said hello crypto it's probably more
entertaining than the books I'm talking

384
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,600
about their their only in their exciting
when you're into it learning but they're

385
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,090
not really like they did against your
like you're just reading material

386
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,740
there's nothing fun there's nothing like
papi about it they really just trying to

387
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,420
like give you material and move on
Versus actually like really engaging and

388
00:31:51,420 --> 00:32:05,370
you would want to read at night versus I
gotta study time this that's cool yeah I

389
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,959
haven't read too many of those but I
haven't friends that have told me that

390
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,310
you know that kind of thing of accurate
fiction exists for the field and I can

391
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:16,060
imagine that's a great way to maybe
start there and then trickled down into

392
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:22,159
the technical books I'd because I'm kind
of motivated now these books are thick

393
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,910
and dense and they're all like for any
pages long and that's not to discourage

394
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,800
you cause it's great there's a lot of
material but again you are committing

395
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,460
your own time and studying and you've
got to got to spend a lot with it

396
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:41,260
toys I'm a big fan of hackers Phillies
so this is the books by a few they're

397
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,540
not too expensive the toys you got your
commercial grade ones which are very

398
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,920
very very expensive and then you got the
ones that we talk about these

399
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,110
conferences which are like mods or very
cheap and that's the ground that I live

400
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:59,740
in the commercial side ones I try to
think of whatever is no $50 and under

401
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:05,070
shooting for $15 range kind of thing so
depending on what area you want to go

402
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,320
into you know everybody specialized
something so those books are great but

403
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,629
most of them talked about testing which
is awesome but there's a lot of wireless

404
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:19,240
hardware social engineering web
application phone application you don't

405
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,260
do all of them you know you have to pick
and choose which ones interests you the

406
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,270
most I know a little bit about all of
them is great and you learn a lot about

407
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:31,770
that but coming to conferences and stuff
but all in all of us have our fields of

408
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:37,420
expertise whether that was forced on us
so we kind of shows that path so we're

409
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,149
going to start playing around with
things

410
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:42,570
you know focus on those tools you know
we've got a lockpicking village next

411
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,009
door if that's something you're
interested in there's a lot of physical

412
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:49,799
security testing you know by peres lock
picks you know by I go to a thrift

413
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:53,929
stores and buy locks cause its brand new
locks are very expensive

414
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:57,960
blocks are very cheap so if you can find
a place that has some old used locks

415
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,559
pick him up in a while watching TV or
just hanging out you can you can

416
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:07,249
practice that way there what the lab
setup certain tools you have to use in a

417
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:10,399
real-life environment so it's a little
harder but you know if you're getting a

418
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,159
wireless card throughout your network
has a lot of really again their stories

419
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,329
a lot of old wireless routers out there
they're very cheap even new ones you

420
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:22,389
know going to the right store ordering
online that can be very cheap so setting

421
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:27,710
up your own wireless router with web
enabled wireless card sniffing your own

422
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,199
traffic and cracking the password that
something you can do at home and that's

423
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,799
fine because you're targeting your own
equipment costs it up for that might be

424
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:39,719
about 40 bucks which isn't bad if you're
saying okay this is a new career path

425
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,399
I'm really excited about let me spend
$40 and I get into it so you know

426
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,399
looking around reading a lot of the
websites you know going to conferences

427
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:52,109
seeing what people post a lot of the
people that are speaking up here again

428
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:56,449
are doing like a modified or the cheap
version of what might be a very

429
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:02,740
expensive tool my repository of toys has
become extensive over the years that's

430
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:07,270
good news is don't buy it all at once
don't spend $2,000 to own everything

431
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:11,319
just 20 bucks here and there cycling
through you'll get to see what you like

432
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,109
and what you don't like it

433
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:19,000
towards the very broad scope of things
but I would suggest investing in them a

434
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,309
little bit taking that first step into
buyers buying that wireless card that

435
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:28,140
does have the sniffing and AP options to
it or buying your first lock pick set

436
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,970
and practicing around homes I think that
more so than anything else going to

437
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,368
having that is a good thing in front of
you that you're playing around with gets

438
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:39,470
you going to that you know tumbling down
the hill towards me know you get an

439
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,939
extra next to you figure out what space
that you enjoy the most I know I did

440
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,410
that for for wireless I was a big
wireless person so I did a lot with WiFi

441
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,100
Bluetooth and I started trickling black
by Matt schools getting on

442
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,200
sheep on Amazon are super cheap on ebay
sometimes used up its really expensive

443
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,990
equipment gets posted an email because
they cycle through the next version they

444
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:03,740
don't care what it sells for some
company offloading so you can pick up

445
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,490
equipment that's that high-end pretty
cheap and a lot of coming to these

446
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,220
conferences and stuff sometimes those
vendors that sell some of it but

447
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,890
definitely investing in some of them you
have to make yourself but they're not

448
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:21,009
terribly difficult so don't feel like
it's a big hurdle to flash a router with

449
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:26,030
open WRC sounds scary if you break it
you might lose the 20 bucks is bent on

450
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,990
the router but they get so once you've
created something I found personally

451
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,459
once I've created something of my own
even it was just flashing around with

452
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,990
new firmware that became like my project
like I had taken the first step that

453
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,089
project is there and it's always looming
in the back of my head

454
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,650
hey this is sitting there I made this
thing i've a better use it

455
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:51,030
contribute back to the community this is
probably the biggest thing and it's a

456
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,960
big hurdle because it's it's very
intimidating to society I'm going to

457
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,290
contribute back in a way and that
doesn't mean you have to say you know

458
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,450
right at all

459
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,740
30 day come up speak about it get get
rolled or get in the news and

460
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,250
and you know go on interviews that
that's not mean that happens sometimes

461
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,480
but that's really like a small niche of
what you can do if you don't know how to

462
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,580
program that all great help put on a
conference if you can design a website

463
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:23,480
for conference if you can review of the
spelling of some or if you can translate

464
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,540
something right if you if you know
Spanish or French and they want to

465
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,240
release a broad scope tool great you can
translate the readme for them that's

466
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,790
contributing cause a lot of us that are
creating the software side we you know

467
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,700
that's what we want to do and that's
where our focus is but we just don't

468
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:44,410
have the skill set to expand over doing
so whatever your skills maybe you don't

469
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,868
have to be the great program are advised
to create something that that works with

470
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:53,830
Metasploit sore your own separate all
there's a lot of ways you can contribute

471
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,819
ask around here

472
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,240
chat with people at the conference see
what they're into and say hey you know

473
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,520
you need help what you do and you know
listen to the skill sets or just free

474
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,759
time a lot of times all the tools that
most people are writing and publishing

475
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,780
the people use these are on people's
free time then I get paid for this this

476
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,810
is on the time that they have a lot out
of their life to work on it which is a

477
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,619
finite amount of time to pay and what
else they've got going on so sometimes

478
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:23,410
it's just time to update something here
I've got this new thing could you write

479
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,230
a little post about what it is done you
get your name out there are you

480
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,450
contributing your you know getting
invested as I mentioned before invested

481
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,770
in kind of the community of security so
they don't think that you know your

482
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:41,020
skill sets are lacking because everybody
has something they can figure out what

483
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,830
that is

484
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:48,710
fail a lot so if you fail at this that's
great because we all fail it to get our

485
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:54,510
own you're failing but you will fail and
you failed big embarrass and that's okay

486
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,780
because everybody here that has put
themselves out there to contribute has

487
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,830
failed so they understand i mean you
might you might get a little bit but

488
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:06,080
ultimately they understand because they
anybody's stuck their neck out has

489
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,700
failed in this community and that's okay
because somebody be there to say hey i

490
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,368
bug fix bug fixes great you've got a bug
here I fixed it that's a huge

491
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:17,400
contribution that makes people

492
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,610
like so much better than I've got a bug
but if you could give me the pics part

493
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,320
that's better than ya know what happened
here but they got this very generic

494
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,800
error message can you recreate it gonna
take me like hours of debugging my own

495
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,370
stuff and you can do it in your
environment and shoot me some debug are

496
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:39,420
what you're running this library about
the blog that would be very helpful this

497
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,230
this is actually saw this at a hotel a
few weeks ago and thought it was really

498
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,890
is the kind of thing you like you stop
at and just like I'm sure somebody's

499
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,670
watching me and I'll just hang out for a
while and in soaking it in the enjoyment

500
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,680
that I found this was like I know the
button turns back but I found it like

501
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:08,020
that in a me happy and this is another
one that it from that I saw what I was I

502
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,620
was traveling I got into hotel my turn
on the TV and I saw this some like

503
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,960
scrambling to find my phone I've got to
get an image of this and I don't know it

504
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,130
doesnt Unported doesn't like label which
ones they are like one through five so I

505
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,320
don't know where this was but we can
just let our imaginations run what the

506
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:36,240
other four or least one of the four my
might be I have no idea where ever you

507
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,259
can find a box somewhere there that's
why I don't know I haven't noticed this

508
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,850
anyway this is just my private
collection

509
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:48,860
an example of my fail who can something
was wrong with this badge you get him

510
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,970
initially look you can you can kind of
see it people up front but I spelled

511
00:40:53,970 --> 00:41:00,450
wrong here on this is the bad reviews
sides rally and I supposed to be fair it

512
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:05,520
was written in it was drawn so there is
no spell check for it and why was it was

513
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,900
in camp so I typed it up this discussion
and I did spell it right

514
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,910
everywhere else that I wrote the word
Raleigh except for the front of the

515
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:19,049
badge even unlike I had a hosted version
of its own statement NDIR hand you rally

516
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,960
that was spelled correctly but of course
in the front of all the bad

517
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:29,900
spell the rally wrong so I apologize
profusely to them but I don't have to

518
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,060
like okay if that's all that what goes
wrong is your best and worst thing

519
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,099
that's fine I can profusely apologized
everybody has to look at that badge and

520
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:41,780
be like what the heck like this but
local besides my the city that I live in

521
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:50,910
children but it happens and the resume
so a lot of this stuff is how you get

522
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:55,700
your skill set and that's my
recommendations so far is one time I was

523
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:01,899
like ok cool perfect a lot of this is
how to build your self up saying screw

524
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:07,089
it to the rest of the world this is my
career path you do unfortunate have some

525
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:11,330
point have to hand out a resume talks
tomorrow sounds like it's late tomorrow

526
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:19,250
sounds like a lot on this but to be fair
so I won't go into it to extensively but

527
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:23,720
there are definitely things you know you
can put in your resume and what I would

528
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,439
suggest is actually going outside of the
traditional resume format of the jobs I

529
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,040
worked at this is this is a very
specific skills that I have I know these

530
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,080
languages and this is my degree I had
these awards outside of that I would

531
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,490
actually put in there i read this book
in our field again there's no

532
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,080
certification the official certification
process it's not like you know being a

533
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,759
contractor and a house you have to be
certified to do certain things or an

534
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,640
electrician we don't we don't have that
checkbox you don't have to resume their

535
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,970
our certifications second but adding
things and that are sort of outside

536
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,250
where you might traditionally put on
that attended a conference speaking at a

537
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,510
conference is great but even just
attending it might not be super

538
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:14,200
impressive to the AHR but when it goes
up to the the manager who ever is hiring

539
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,180
they say wow you have consistently gone
the conference is over the years you

540
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:23,140
read these 400 page book that's a
technical book that's a commitment now

541
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,080
and especially during the interview
process they might try to reference that

542
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,520
stuff and you sound a lot more
impressive than what might just be

543
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,270
coming through so I realized recently
that adding that

544
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:38,610
materially in there if it gets ignored
it gets ignored that's fine but a boost

545
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:42,480
credentials that are very difficult to
show on paper if you've been spent the

546
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,810
last six months of your job doing
security stuff but your new job title

547
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:51,380
hasn't changed then there's not a lot
that you can show on a resume about it

548
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,270
soliciting these other things that
you've done sort of on the side or

549
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:59,090
assisted with Project X bring down on a
resume is great did you know you can

550
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:02,510
list what you did or but anytime you can
share with us and while you've gone

551
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:07,250
above and beyond to get into security
that's a great thing to put other things

552
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,900
for resume you know about the the slides
so this is how the standout right adding

553
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:22,830
those additional steps on your resume
the song made me so happy I I think this

554
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:26,470
is probably a t-shirt I'm sure it is
somewhere and I need to find it because

555
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:33,970
it's great outside of the other boosting
showing that you can be a technical

556
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:39,220
writer so you don't publish something
but if you there's training in that but

557
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:43,660
even without that you need to write
reports which are boring and the sock

558
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:48,540
but you have to do that as part of your
job if you want to go legit some is

559
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,230
going to be paying you to turn in
something that they can understand so

560
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,530
you do have to learn how to format not
not like

561
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,550
check correctly and you know write
novels it's how to translate what you

562
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,610
have done to somebody who might not be
technical or targeting if it is

563
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,900
extremely technical or the middle ground
you need to know how to talk to your

564
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,410
audience and write it in a way that in
the final report that gets handed to the

565
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:17,450
c-level executive or you know your boss
or whatever they're happy with it they

566
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:22,560
understand some of the layers of what's
going on and in general how to fix them

567
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,390
so you do have to write extensively in
this process a lot of its the fun side

568
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:31,480
but then at the end of the week of the
month of the quarter whenever you're

569
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,109
having to turn in some sort of reports
of practicing that

570
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:40,558
I i dont have a great method of doing
that other than to say what

571
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,749
right up by a blog writing but I
targeting blog ya Hussain write a blog

572
00:45:45,749 --> 00:45:51,140
that's that's that's a great idea at
least you'll be writing out to a

573
00:45:51,140 --> 00:46:01,609
security field

574
00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:08,180
saying that hired people just based on
what they have published on their blog

575
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:12,589
and in the interview process can be
extremely intimidating I mean I've been

576
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:15,599
through several rounds of these things
that I've given them and it can be

577
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,160
intimidating especially when you're
coming up and I've ever done is you know

578
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,879
of UVM lab environment from my
experience people that have come from

579
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,269
that that have done the VN labs that
have never done pen testing before in

580
00:46:28,269 --> 00:46:32,069
their life after a good six months
you're either in her house I mean a year

581
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:37,359
you're solid but you either get on but
it's either something you you find that

582
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,058
you really are passionate about and you
go into it you're spending extra time

583
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:45,900
learning about the tools outside of your
job or you're like man it's just me and

584
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,650
it's true that six-month gap and after a
year

585
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:52,730
your bro I mean you are you might your
professional at that point so it's not

586
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,930
this really long hard look like the
four-year degree don't have to go

587
00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:00,109
through that I like a four-year process
you're either a nap and technical

588
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:05,319
reporting technical writing skills
having that coming in is probably one of

589
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:08,308
the few things you can't really learned
along the way I mean you do but you

590
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:12,319
kinda have to have that day one cause if
you're if you need a little help on your

591
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,499
you know your plans that's fine but if
you turn in the report that is awful

592
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:19,839
that gets noted like right away I mean
if you working with internally

593
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:24,359
especially working with clients or third
parties and they turn it back and they

594
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:29,499
say what is this we paid a lot of money
for it you will hear from your boss very

595
00:47:29,499 --> 00:47:35,160
quickly so writing a technical blog if
you I came from academia helping out

596
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,538
with publications as great as you go
through a lot of revisions with that

597
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:39,640
sort of thing

598
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,118
certifications there a lot of
certifications out there to help a lot

599
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,960
getting past AHR AHR people say nothing
but minimal requirements and again

600
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,339
unfortunately there's not a
general-purpose certification for a we

601
00:47:55,339 --> 00:48:00,450
do so outside of you know your previous
jobs and college certifications look

602
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:06,439
great on a resume when you get past a
jar it doesn't really matter I mean if

603
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,269
you're doing government contracting a
lot of times they're very stringent on

604
00:48:10,269 --> 00:48:11,689
what you have to have

605
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:16,569
outside a government contracting you can
generate talk you into something as long

606
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:20,210
as you get that interview you can move
on

607
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:25,220
certifications cost a lot of money in
general and are filled my advice

608
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,529
personally is if you have an employer
willing to spend the money on you to do

609
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,790
this which a lot of times I have friends
that have been dismissed raters that you

610
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,400
know the company wants the nigga
security training so they're willing to

611
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,839
spend the money to send them out or have
them go to this training and get

612
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:45,680
certified even if that's not you know
they're not the internal blue team if

613
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,549
you're doing it on your phone I it's not
really worth the money because it is

614
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,790
gonna set you back if you if you've got
a big stack of money on the side of

615
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:59,380
interest you go for it I would consider
it more again for the training like we

616
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,849
talked about college I would say I've
done some I learned a lot from them

617
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:10,240
because I was really focus on I want to
learn but as far as the the amount of

618
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,200
money goes you know these are generally
week-long courses that they just they

619
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,629
just the cost a lot there's a lot that
goes into them so I wouldn't you know

620
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:21,640
refinance your house or something just
to be able to go for it to certificates

621
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,490
in order to put them on a resume but if
you can take advantage of it where I

622
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:32,810
don't wanna specifically talked about
which city gets to get or not get there

623
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:38,190
is definitely one that you have to get
if you want more government and there's

624
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:43,480
some that are only open this up the
audience the ones that are in expenses

625
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,790
do you how do we feel about them you
probably know the ones I'm talking about

626
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,450
and trying to be sort of specifically
vague on them but the ones that are very

627
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:56,990
inexpensive they actually seem I
personally the kind of her resume and

628
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:01,160
they look great if you had it along with
other like you you were doing and I T

629
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,609
job and you have seven other
certifications that kind of parallel its

630
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:06,130
you got it along the way

631
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:09,290
no problem but if that's the only
significant you put on your resume thats

632
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:14,740
just this particular security 18 doesn't
it kind of shows you had a little

633
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:19,060
interest or you have some free time but
I would much rather see that you went to

634
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,660
a conference or read a book like you get
a lot more out of that

635
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:57,920
because that seems to be a lot more
personal motivation

636
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,609
so people that have high before how to
get through a chart how do we feel about

637
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:05,270
that is again a chart doesn't know what
they want what you want

638
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,040
they would know what you've given them
as a list and it's hard to define that

639
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:30,850
on the list

640
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:51,230
give me your certs up today if you have
certs to an extent

641
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:56,290
focusing on energy level like you know
this is this your first job in the field

642
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:04,460
yeah yeah I focusing mostly I doesn't
hurt the kind of it said save Richards

643
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:07,930
great but don't make that your big this
is what I've done to get into the field

644
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:13,399
like you really having more than that in
just a second to the last point I want

645
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,150
to make is what you're doing right here
coming to a conference mingling with

646
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:21,930
people getting up on Twitter emailing
you know making friends in the community

647
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:27,270
you know I can't tell you how many times
that I've just met bump into somebody

648
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:32,070
and you know child with them and had
inspiring ideas private schools I wrote

649
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:37,290
a new tools or collaborations I i cant
imagine that idea where I am today

650
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:41,710
without having come to a conference
because you get to talk at all levels

651
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:46,930
you can read like you have a discussion
that might last an hour that it took you

652
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,859
now whatever it three days were the
times to read the book but you have that

653
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:55,799
wine discussion that was like oh yeah
wow that really ok that's the

654
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,470
fundamental of that that wasn't
explained to me ever before because you

655
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,419
know reading a lot is boring but
chatting with people that are in the

656
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:07,030
field is actually pretty exciting so if
you're coming to these events come to

657
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:11,830
the talks we like it when people come to
talk but don't just go home afterwards I

658
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:12,910
don't just split for lunch

659
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:16,549
hang out and chat with people I would
suggest even if there's talks the don't

660
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:21,600
specifically interests you you know you
can skip them it is allowed and chatting

661
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,410
up with a stranger that you've never met
before entering into the conversation

662
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:29,399
would generally a very friendly crowd of
people and very open to discussion

663
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,600
especially with you know things that we
are very knowledgeable about will make

664
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,569
stuff up but really use the time you
have as much as possible with this core

665
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:43,770
group of people to learn what what
they've gone to open it up now we have a

666
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:48,350
few minutes after five minutes left any
like open advice and people that are in

667
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:52,660
the field ya get a mental or

668
00:53:52,660 --> 00:54:03,000
get to get a men's or boys somewhere to
publisher code and was lost on Stack

669
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,210
Exchange

670
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:10,730
to post a blog post something that you
can contribute even user guides to get a

671
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:14,500
lot of us like we're at school has
created a person out there and then we

672
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,710
never anything good about how to use it
like in deep details because it's like

673
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,690
you obviously it worked for me and I
wrote it so everybody else we'll figure

674
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,789
it out on their own which is really not
the case at all so even if you write

675
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:29,440
that one post the talent to install the
tool sometimes that will get way more

676
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,910
hits than you would expect than the
actual original page that post that's

677
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:38,339
all they can go somewhere else and get a
lot better because we just don't have

678
00:54:38,339 --> 00:55:09,190
time for that kind of stuff

679
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:17,790
having a child you are hiring having a
child just send everything flooding to

680
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:21,009
you doesn't matter because again a lot
of people that you know I mentioned the

681
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:25,240
biologists you can be a ballot just
that's a great hacker on the side and

682
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,890
that it doesn't show up in a resume at
all but as soon as you get that hour

683
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,500
long interview how hard is it even if
you say are you a preliminary half an

684
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,790
hour interview like five minutes in your
gonna know this wasn't on your resume

685
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:42,220
but you're you're actually really into
the stuff just doesn't show up well on

686
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,569
paper so I would absolutely if you can
get a Chartist

687
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:51,900
here's the position title there's no
cost for this in whatever comes in

688
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:57,869
based on that title filter Dalton me I
can get through a chart that I think

689
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:02,069
that's that's absolutely awesome and
contributing I definitely got my job

690
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:07,000
because of my public we're not academia
as I had spoken at conferences and

691
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,940
release some tools and that people that
we're hiring and that they saw me and

692
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,660
they they'd use the tools before and
that was that was my way and I mean it

693
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,509
wasn't right tools to get in there was a
space that was open and I thought I

694
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,390
could you know how bout with
contributing but it really that's the

695
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:29,520
biggest resume booster here plus
mingling it if you really want a job

696
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,680
it's high posting it online is not the
greatest way if you can bump into

697
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,310
somebody here is anybody here

698
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:42,440
hiring right now we have some people in
a larger room we would have just as many

699
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,210
with theirs it's hard to find people
right i mean people just don't apply and

700
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:51,240
I think a lot of it is that they don't
feel like there might be other skill

701
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,200
level but they don't feel like it cause
I never had a job in the field it's

702
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,950
really hard to break into you and that's
why give the stock because there's

703
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:03,520
nothing that defines you as a pen test
their prior to getting that first job so

704
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,020
it's really really really hard and sand
intimidating to be in the interview

705
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:11,319
process and look I just don't know if
that's fine to say look I read about it

706
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:14,589
before I'm never have been able to get
hands-on experience you know I know what

707
00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:17,400
this bill does I know we're talking
about but here's why

708
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,220
at Ross's people in general you know you
get that first little bit of time to try

709
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:30,600
to get get your sea legs and they should
be open to it thanks for having me I had

710
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,400
a job here that I wasn't able to post
and should be up this weekend I wrote a

711
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,260
simple were driving scandal that doesn't
use GPS it's just basically naming logs

712
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,080
is a very simple but I thought since I
was a scene here at least like to do an

713
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:49,660
official sky job sky Doug Conn to drop
so I really appreciate it

714
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,520
anybody could raise their hands been
dusters and I'll be splitting soon but

715
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,650
chat with them about if you're
interested in me again we're very open

716
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:02,300
community we need people we need more
people can pull in enough people to

717
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,410
actually go down this career path so
it's a great one to have I've enjoyed it

718
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:10,750
very much and I think they would say the
same thing so they just got icon dock
