1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,050
did not talk about to see is tha TSA
luggage locks details flaws and making

2
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,890
the best of a bad lock Manning's agent
in July when I dot com anybody who

3
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,400
visited I'm interested in education but
I don't know if he could come ahead of

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,470
its time on let me know I'm also a
senior information security consultant

5
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,960
for chest and a co-founder of Debbie
kind of in Louisville Kentucky you think

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,030
some people are doing this research a
lot people really help me help me find

7
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,660
pictures to help me find more locks
should have added J go to this

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,449
particular list not I think about it but
dog since been doing helped alot of the

9
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,500
research David all employees and thanks
lady million

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,840
least I publicizing some pictures that I
just need the pictures johnnie Christmas

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,110
doing a lot of work on a 3d putting keys
I had no idea how to find out the violet

12
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,040
that at all

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,479
yeah he's from the first person put up
3d

14
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:19,110
keep it all when I talk a CA he was also
help you find some pictures and most

15
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,039
awesome allotment or so first of all why
this talk I'll ttyl not to stalk yes

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,670
they are easy to gently wake and pick
open TSA locks for the most part not

17
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,420
exactly high security locks most of them
are pretty easy to get into however not

18
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,010
all of them necessarily are we going to
hang a bit and yes there's always open

19
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,400
baggage when the classic cricket taking
up an emphasis if a lock closure you put

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,580
into the zipper zipper part we can get
what you want and then pull the tied

21
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,170
together the pools and this backup but
also is interested in doing this is my

22
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,860
most technical challenge while a lot of
people know that TSA locks of crap

23
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,640
you'll see much talked about it in the
public least not until recently some

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,150
people have this false sense of security

25
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,170
these locks actually provide well any
real security and talk done on it before

26
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,940
is also mostly this interesting
technical challenge to try to make the

27
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,319
keys for myself and

28
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,738
to get some stuff also love you made a
real big deal but the photos that been

29
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:31,639
leaked in the past few months really you
could always be produced his keys by

30
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:35,739
just taking apart the loss of any master
key system where you can take a potluck

31
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:40,069
you can help me figure out what key will
open it and no good thing with the slow

32
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:44,589
talk is a good example of how I security
food security fails when it's not really

33
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,980
obscure you gonna argue that moments all
security issue securities cutie like

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,719
security what's your password is
security of what you encryption key yes

35
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:58,099
however when somebody can be easily
found out by someone using a drill in

36
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:04,500
coming apart a lot it's not much so
curious concern TSA lock started out was

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,849
the TSA demanded the ability to to
inspect all luggage and this was placed

38
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,349
out there on the 21st 2003 so for
several months they were cutting lots

39
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,480
left and right if you would like a
halfway decent luggage lock on and

40
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,480
they'd cut it to the connections that
the bag this caused a lot of pissed off

41
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,828
Flyers

42
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:28,759
because they want us to be intact when
it gets to the destination airport I

43
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:32,089
love people thinking that the TSA should
care that all these leaked you got

44
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,019
leaked out there is no reason for them
not let security issue from their

45
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,810
standpoint it's in use a security issue
as far as the stuff in the bags people

46
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,739
could have done that already is a bag

47
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,430
dozens of ways to get into I'm not
really worried about airport security

48
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:57,379
mobile security infringed upon by these
locks is passengers themselves now has

49
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:05,828
two major brand of two standards of TSA
approved luggage slots when you see the

50
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,009
most often this travel century they
don't actually make their own locks but

51
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:14,509
they are authorized a system of keys
that you can use standards for TSA

52
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:21,190
accepted locks that it was started by
Jon Gambrell

53
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:27,020
delegates consultant figures to be like
also look at luggage operator in charge

54
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,568
it's important that people can become a
consultant for airports airlines and

55
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:39,339
with the TSA and since like the
seventies now different luggage handlers

56
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,879
had known that they a certain set of
keys would open up most luggage locks

57
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:50,779
2250 keys that would get him to host a
brand of luggage locks and has been

58
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:58,270
around for a long time is also safe
skies that was David drop and safe skies

59
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,930
has two patents on how to make how do
these luggage locks and they have been

60
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,830
from lawsuits between these two and
these people seem to manufacture their

61
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:15,599
own locks in the known brand now a lot
of interest me came from pictures then

62
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:21,539
leaked online like those ones out there
on the hill dad and oldest budget groups

63
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,339
but some people that folks take pictures
of the TSA keys so give us some idea of

64
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:31,019
what they look like this double 06 looks
like it's been greatly the form examined

65
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,969
dented but having just the picture it
gives you some information if you can

66
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:40,439
get scaling right about what the key cut
our news while back about on people

67
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,959
taking photos of keys and instantly
online key makers to get keys duplicate

68
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,379
did not get the TSA keys because they
won't necessarily have the right team

69
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,759
like you take a picture of someone like
quick sticky you can easily get that

70
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,360
sent to a key manufacturing get one
produced these while you're on the right

71
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,180
key blank you can easily get produced
here is another good picture of the TSA

72
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,159
key set and if you most interesting
looking at pat into these various DSA

73
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:12,959
key ways their record there is surely
you have your own key or you have a

74
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,360
combination that you use to open the
lock and a TSA has a master key that

75
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,769
they can give you like inspect all your
stuff so you can see there's no bombs or

76
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:27,039
whatever in their desires are concerned
I got a lot of information to the

77
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,659
gentleman's name who actually wrote the
article now at the skating at the moment

78
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:37,029
but I got some information from looking
up various patterns on the different

79
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,740
kisi ki ways as well as an article that
someone wrote I'm trying to the

80
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,310
gentleman's name

81
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:57,230
really well actually visit the site and
that will hopefully Miami

82
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:08,920
right now I'm not finding is that
embarrassing his name on here

83
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:17,910
oh yes Mark Webber Tobias early research
on these anyway the functionality you

84
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,530
have several ways you get into these
lots some will most likely gonna find

85
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,549
have two systems of locking one is going
to be the combination itself and there

86
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,230
was going to be a key for getting into
it and so you'll see a lot of dialogue

87
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:38,760
that when you Steve right here and at
the bottom of them will be a little

88
00:07:38,760 --> 00:08:04,210
designation for what it is and that ok
anyway

89
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:13,989
sometimes unfortunately not get better
but something fun of it anyway the TSA

90
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,699
double of 5 o'clock they know which
particular key to try to open it with

91
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:28,630
and I'm going to start QuickTime Player
I can actually make it function somewhat

92
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:48,180
better

93
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:57,219
agency has double of five unanswered bob
was also like double seven and posed a

94
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,790
challenge you want some seven different
key ways than you also have the safe

95
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,730
skies ones which some people have been
working on reproducing night out events

96
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,110
and on Twitter has been working on
producing those and the ones they see

97
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,470
what particular number is on the log
they have a set of keys as you saw his

98
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:20,060
previous pictures they can pick up and
open the law so here's my personal stuff

99
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,399
that I carry around with me abdomen
pSATS I have a few more than other

100
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,540
people and I had been a massive use all
of these but I thought as a double 05 so

101
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,279
below five key tenet

102
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:40,270
opened up a lot of one's work double way
to introduce uses only expect these the

103
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,939
combination on somebody's but the TSA
agent used the key way they do then

104
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,279
settled in ways the classic master
planning system will you have

105
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,830
essentially the springs the driver pins
Nikki pins on some of the stacks to have

106
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,660
a little extra wafer in between those
two different levels at which a key will

107
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,870
open it so you can have a master key to
open all of them and have a different

108
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,970
key for each individual user if you
really wanted to the problem of these

109
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,920
kinda messaging system is it does make
it easier to pick in 2008 open LA Times

110
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,150
doesn't more than one key to open it
just settled in at levels you could have

111
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,370
it at opening up the number of
possibilities for levels you get the pin

112
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,470
that can actually have to turn that she
align

113
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,980
wafers you basically doubled the number
of possible keys that would work it

114
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,980
allowed also used racial oxen's dead now
mastered way for a little bit different

115
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,310
way way for lock works is when you have
the right key and sudden everything up

116
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,020
to the shoreline and you can just turn
it pulls out of the law

117
00:10:43,020 --> 00:11:00,840
crews that does suck into and I thought
I had one ready to show you up here

118
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:14,890
actually took a part you can see the
wave is in it for the user just open up

119
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:22,050
with the combination but in my case and
I have the keys for it now looks like

120
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:34,949
he's made in a bit going to keep way and
you know how it moves all of those

121
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:45,590
little wave is out of the way and then
you can open a lot so no bombs their way

122
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,010
to do this with the way for system if
you have wafers that are well if you

123
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,890
have a way to lock and keys without the
use and the TSA agent

124
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,319
do this we don't wait for mastering
system like you might see something like

125
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,080
this would be like a normal way flock
but the way flock to these TSA locks if

126
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,920
it has two key ways what you'll have is
shaped like this so it's one key way on

127
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,660
the left and one key way on the right
and the one right in this case is the

128
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,250
one that the TSA agents using the one
left when you are using soap bubbles the

129
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:21,380
shared space lose the user reddit TSA
agent and show you an example of

130
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:28,110
something like this if you look at this
one just us two key ways one left won

131
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,030
the white and the levels of those wafers
are not the same on both sides

132
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,850
sometimes a little less pronounced like
that you see the shape of that way for

133
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,530
inside there is a different light on the
left side on the right side another way

134
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:46,189
to mass the way to lock system

135
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:53,020
the budget McKee way closer look at it
we believe these were all double sevens

136
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,970
nothing's epilogue to look at going
around collecting all the TSA locks I

137
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:04,140
can find so I can scrub them apart and
try to be peace all the keys so I had a

138
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,590
hard time finding the below 14 longest
time till Jago give me one Donohue said

139
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:14,520
Khan like last weekend now I have one
but i dont have to I'm still looking for

140
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,990
more I don't think people manufacture
these anymore because everyone who's

141
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,190
ever show me at ESADE but double oh one
lock it when he picked up at some

142
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,270
general commercial store like eight
years ago I don't see him anymore so I'm

143
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,290
assuming they've kind of been stopped
manufacturing now been looking around

144
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,260
for public for this I think night out
still looking for a good one up and you

145
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,250
can get a 10 9 to be all blank from Elko
to work on it but you have to file it

146
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,010
down on the size and make it smaller to
actually be able to get a proper blank

147
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,040
for this video 91 see also looks about
the same but it won't work so I had

148
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,329
actually produced a mask some people
have got him he put in one's to work

149
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,000
then there's a TSA double O two key
identify the most suck second most

150
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,270
common key way out there as far as TSA
locks concern and there's a couple good

151
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,800
blanked out there for most along I've
been producing and using elko 1611 laws

152
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,400
but I'm thinking the JMA FCS Wandy maybe
a better one that may be well switch to

153
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,380
a more locks and practice body hasn't
double two blocks to hand out the

154
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,310
questions at the end of the talk of
three long has this weird pyramid shape

155
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:33,479
and they're usually pretty easy to break
open in some cases if you contingent on

156
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,010
right but you don't seem too often goes
double for the double for as well quite

157
00:14:39,010 --> 00:15:02,730
frankly pathetic ok all it is a bomb
attack

158
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:28,610
and that as well as I have a look and
let you know someone's been in your bag

159
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,410
of a TSA agent gets in your bag
generally speaking with us both to do as

160
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,920
they leave behind a little piece of
paper saying that they were in their

161
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:45,969
baggage but a lot of TSA locks if you
pick up just one hit but when you can

162
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:52,029
pick you pick up you can get the clock
open without setting off a little

163
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:57,670
indicate a flag in this case its crystal
structure you can reach in a tool and a

164
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:05,250
little luck but it's going into the
dial-in poppin decide if I make this not

165
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:24,499
full screen if it will help that
temporarily or gas are about this

166
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:45,040
it's not seeing the device

167
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,069
sees me

168
00:16:49,070 --> 00:17:13,750
let me go back to town

169
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:29,680
go ahead for good at what I mean what is
work with the

170
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,250
ok open the door for easy made by CCL

171
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:43,490
branding on it the patents for it but
60% essentially it's just a low turning

172
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:52,310
tool you can open it with a simple ball
dick ball picnic set and open up the

173
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:57,560
double 05 this is the third most common
TSA lock you find out there and it's

174
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,360
essentially an into blank you can make a
pretty much public key thought out of

175
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:09,090
the Yoko 1090 be so it's a simple math
the log into blank no big problems W 6th

176
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,490
only when it's really been impressed it
to us so far I've tried the picket

177
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,870
awesome enjoy the picket David all of
his tried to pick it up there to pick

178
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,989
the thing to do is maybe it's kind of
town and so you have to take a look at

179
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,750
it and see if we can take it I only have
one of these I want to eventually be

180
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,930
able to take this apart and make a
master key out of it but it was the only

181
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:36,780
sample I had only two things you say in
high in luggage like 1000 protector and

182
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,240
they were designed by a bus and I've
been told by a friend Amanda feels like

183
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,410
those spool pins in there as well which
greatly complicate the picking of a

184
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,230
bases-loaded dimple lock so all the
bidding is on the side of the key as you

185
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:57,180
see here and actually opened yet by
picking it simple awkward things up into

186
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,680
lockers just the bidding is on the side
you have keys look like this

187
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:09,270
financial IW 677 this is by far the most
common one out there and I still get by

188
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,160
probably it is well I have been produced
some keys the tonight CVR can somewhat

189
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,290
work but you have to get both sides the
same and it's not a symmetric key by

190
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,899
itself so it's kind of hard to get filed
really don't most the TSA double O seven

191
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,520
keys at ever seen a lot of it was seen
as only been single sided so you also

192
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,320
see this bidding on both sides

193
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,889
this act was known as convenience key in
most cases because they only use one

194
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,710
side of the building but by doubling the
sides you double the way life of the key

195
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,080
agencies using the ski a whole lot so I
double 07 its prob

196
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:50,779
important that they do that and he out
there that comes with Embarq

197
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:57,890
target and travel miles and target you
can take this can you can file it down

198
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:04,149
to get a pretty much completely proper
master key for the double seven and

199
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:10,799
double 77 is also pointed out all sorts
of being sneaky ways like that before in

200
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,600
this one is the Midwest key way that I
want extra lift the bottom you see some

201
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,730
have the to-do keywords side-by-side and
I have a lot of extra room so there's a

202
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,649
whole lot of variance in an attempt to
duplicate the keys here in a bit now

203
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:30,729
there's also the classic wait in the
most of them are super simple to rate

204
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:49,500
open you simply attention you have to
really do much work on it depends it's

205
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,950
usually pretty easy to get on the pop
open

206
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,450
going which way to do it does a lot of
these ones will open up counter

207
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:05,770
clockwise and anti-clockwise so does the
ranking technique just simply go in and

208
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:13,340
making it opens up which isn't a big
deal but as always in these as well

209
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,189
bombing bombing attacks by what we're
gonna mostly because most these locks

210
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:24,710
our way for locks and I miss him is to
begin with but most is locked because

211
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,580
the using wafers which would camp now
one thing that will work in a whole lot

212
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,629
of these is shooting attacks since you
can reach me back a key way to move

213
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,920
aside the locking dog with a pic and
I'll see if I can actually illustrate

214
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:55,260
that a man that is so annoying go to the
back of the lock you preaching past all

215
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,020
the pan handle wafers of sports about
locking it pops open and I mean there

216
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:07,580
was a lot actually have this particular
problem which starts on and leave it

217
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:17,590
open 2012 have a lot built by like this
one from Samsonite one side to the other

218
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:34,918
side x sides using bigger issue

219
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,070
anyway hard time finding that may be
better off picking which the back of it

220
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,739
but you can see the light of these ones
you can do that too and it just popped

221
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:51,249
open real quick what happened to my
slides now it was a ball bearings you

222
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:55,789
can't do this at all some TSA locks use
ball bearings instead of locking dog

223
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:58,450
shaming

224
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,859
keys to spin you be able to actually get
in

225
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:11,609
shimon air it was a very small lot and
also those ones like the Massillon 463

226
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:21,668
464 alt you and ball bearing you won't
be able to anyway

227
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:25,539
has also been like jugglers like I have
a set of that team coffin keys from

228
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:29,730
sparrow and I had great luck using them
to Cincy Jimmy open a TSA lock but this

229
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:35,809
weekend it and eventually popped open
there's also the technique of the coding

230
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:40,428
and decoding works you take the decoding
knife and hopefully the last time I

231
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:58,259
tried to use this really flaky videos of
you as you reach interlocked with the

232
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:10,080
coating night your filthy regularities
finally regularity for it or not it

233
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,559
drops into you find that you stop there
then you go to the next one thing not

234
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,830
just up and then turn the dial is
equally every single time so it reduces

235
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,580
combinations in the case of this one
from like a thousand different

236
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:28,830
combinations to 10 because you sit down
to call him a lot of acceptable to that

237
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,879
if you take the time to really you could
make when he sings open a lot less time

238
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:46,190
now

239
00:24:46,190 --> 00:25:00,929
but you can feel it fall into you last
line all those up and then turn evenly

240
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:06,279
but what's more interesting is making
Kisa saying yes the photos can help give

241
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:10,090
you idea what blank me potentially work
and make you a better idea that will

242
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:15,709
work in more like that you actually have
but you can just blocks and do it that's

243
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:22,980
what I've been doing also unlikely to
prison for prime he'll probably going to

244
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:29,220
reproduce photo for you so they start
tearing apart with this one from Brinks

245
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,529
I got them all no doubt the bottom and
it's nice cuz you must rule out a few

246
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:38,529
spots on it and you can put up the core
and you see it right here and what I did

247
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:44,990
was I took one of blacks from the house
into lockdown made by embark and travel

248
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:50,600
smart comment and file them down to you
see the unfiled ones on the right and

249
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,980
followed ones on the left side had filed
on the right spots and get it

250
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,009
violet are showing second

251
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:05,350
brands that have the property already in
that you can just filed down if you look

252
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:09,480
when they had a similar shape to what
you see right there on the right here

253
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,830
that's the one you want to find and then
down you also pick up a little bit the

254
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:21,019
end because in point a little bit long
for largest a locks closed to plan and I

255
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:26,320
do is I take out the way for lock me she
have no key inserted you see how far

256
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,039
down the wafers drop that would drop
into this law channel and you won't be

257
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,769
able to unlock you put in the wrong key
might still be a misaligned you might

258
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:40,090
have weight was lifted to hi this is the
case for the regular key that I used as

259
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:45,959
a blank but you just keep putting it in
the heights are falling down the spot

260
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,639
with lifting too much and input in again
and see news keep doing that with Peter

261
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:54,789
Lee until you get to the right height
and waiting for using doing that with is

262
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:58,020
that people file has a teardrop

263
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,379
shape to it and the company that makes
them but I didn't call us and they

264
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,970
really good people involved in using
food producing a lot of my initial keys

265
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,870
that the initial key behind filing I try
to be produced in my key duplicator I've

266
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:16,139
got is also people who have done all
sorts of 3d printing work upon the free

267
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,160
depending what is a lot of good people
people in the print on the wrong side

268
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,440
that the double for now is in Thailand
wrong size actually fit in double for I

269
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,650
think the double 07 the people largely
worked a lot of cases where people

270
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,950
actually do get a lot picked open with
one of the keys it almost happenstance

271
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,140
because the thomas hasn't seen his
lawyers very very loose so it doesn't

272
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,810
take a whole lot to like break one open
I'm also thinking summit might be an

273
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:52,470
issue of questioning happening but as we
positives out there and I know during

274
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,870
Christmas still working on making better
versions of the treaty putting one's me

275
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,500
I'm going around looking for key blanks
two different blocks instead caused the

276
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:06,990
blast caused more reliable the one that
we do so far we have to have a 74 before

277
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:16,580
sleep easier to have been made yet and
of course last seven sites most of North

278
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,520
Ave want to have around four people have
them into choosing fives their way to go

279
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:26,660
sounds good thanks for those now some
random stuff from the packages was a key

280
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,260
code and on this particular key it
always starts with you every single

281
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,250
package study 0 that looks like it
wasn't printed on the same point so if

282
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,020
you look at the TSA double seventy you
notice that it doesn't look as any cut

283
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,460
at the bayfront part of the key so there
is some kind of keep holding to it the

284
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:51,070
student standards are key coding as far
as you can say for a master lock into a

285
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,929
cut of one cut a to cut a free cut and
so forth national what standard these

286
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,940
ones are following you figured out I'm
still trying to find a public key plank

287
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,350
for double 07 survey by help with that
I'd appreciate it

288
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,179
way shape looks like that and I can show
you some examples but I just cannot find

289
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,650
a public even that small enough

290
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:19,270
Ford keys that looks things shape the
way too fat that can I 2 BR is closed

291
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,960
but got little lip here at the bottom

292
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,860
shave off now everything we're doing is
making a bunch of single sided double

293
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:30,540
stevenson's you don't we need both sides
could not be easier to trim up but you

294
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,690
have five probably hasn't yet

295
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,540
couple of catalogs I'm going through to
actually find a blank also exposed laws

296
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,610
and said i've seen someone say it's
illegal to replicate these keys

297
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:47,919
ok also outlaws out that people pointed
me to that we do certain entities except

298
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,140
mailbox locks those laws I think you can
do it and deal D locks I'm done anything

299
00:29:52,140 --> 00:30:01,140
exercise TSA locks spite the fact would
say despite what they may say adda

300
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:07,510
travel century now some cases some keys
are protected by patents wasn't planning

301
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:12,020
commercial blanks that work obviously
the key ways not pat it was something to

302
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,110
do with a patent the key wins in this
file shaped key for so many years and

303
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:24,360
that's the way to ensure some kind of
security but I'm planning out there by

304
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,740
default that are close enough to work
just fine

305
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:32,340
also occasion I don't know trolling
online about keys when I asked Master

306
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:38,129
Lock I want to duplicate the key for my
4683 cute luggage lock which blank title

307
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,820
license to use banks they say to
maintain the integrity of tsa oversight

308
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:48,060
of the TSX up the system do piece on
available on TSA locks so not so much

309
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,190
and I produced Mon doubles 744 no
problem but they wouldn't exactly help

310
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,910
on that you want more information on TSA
locks in general have an article out

311
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,070
there that I wrote on how I did
duplication and look at more about TSA

312
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,200
locks docks and has a timeline out there

313
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,300
the work that's been done on the TSA
locks and the photos have been leaked

314
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:14,800
and is also a report on TSA lock by Mark
Webber to bias in 2004 he only covers he

315
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:21,169
mentioned the double A one and only test
I think it was to 2005 cuz I think the

316
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,580
six and seven

317
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,330
out yet

318
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:30,080
think the seventh which replaced the one
that was out at one time is also give

319
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,879
you all of us right up into the core on
PSA doubles seven locks yours knows I'm

320
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,110
a hand model in some of these pictures
there and 10 announcement difficulties

321
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,800
happening next year I believe the proper
date for september 22 26 so make you can

322
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,440
assume a good cause check out in Sec is
when I attend every year usually poster

323
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,420
contest you may or may not next year
maybe the slow but before I dot com

324
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,460
which you I know about obviously good
cop in Grand Rapids Michigan Circle City

325
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:07,110
con up in Indianapolis and show me con
in st. Louis but that's about it and he

326
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,870
might have any questions just got a good
question I got some TSA locks will you

327
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:24,159
do you think any questions and the
double 692 open on forty you can only

328
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:37,830
get that on that put take a look at you
can't get it as a separate law

329
00:32:37,830 --> 00:33:06,000
he has the keys to get the keys and yes

330
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:17,120
about their security and only the
security of the prolonging the

331
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,600
passengers so that's about it doesn't
make it any easier for some of this new

332
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:41,540
bomb on so yeah yeah yeah but I mean was
nothing is going to change anything that

333
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,770
is not what we get

334
00:33:43,770 --> 00:34:00,020
go get keep the keys to the double to
the longer the two keys actually I was

335
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:12,790
of limited I was flying someplace and I
had big well I hadn't simply lock up a

336
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:19,790
lot and I had all these with me and
pulled out of my own bags like oh so you

337
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,989
collect them like yeah I'm researching
the security of the keys I wish I got a

338
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,250
camera for racial questions so far off
but I didn't think to do that ahead of

339
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:36,110
time so exactly but they don't plan on
my flight my pics that you saw a little

340
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:45,429
bit ago all the time and at the pool
outlook down

341
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:54,179
residue and then this passage rate on so
I haven't had any problems so well that

342
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,899
lock picks on the side of it

343
00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:05,058
spells allotment

344
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:19,420
exactly yeah and I'm essentially damaged
locks and if I suppose yes because a lot

345
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:30,549
of them I say yes a lot of them you have
one that opened views the combination to

346
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:36,910
open if used the key so you could
probably break the key and then drug

347
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:45,788
combinations work with the TSA lock off
yeah yeah you could make it or put

348
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:50,230
little glue in it or something like that
and the normal mechanism would just got

349
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:57,299
a call them maybe a few it could screw
up your own spot and look this show more

350
00:35:57,299 --> 00:36:00,910
the alert systems allow you to look just
wanted to say we're not the blocks it

351
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,890
open you can get out of just picking the
lock instead actually lucky like I was

352
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:12,670
able to pick it doesn't pop the flag and
I didn't want we're used to key it does

353
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:17,410
pop up a little flag I think he has it
right down so I can't show it to you

354
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:25,440
live up there to have a little look
system on the top of it and it has long

355
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,500
been in it but you can take a little
screwdriver and turn something inside of

356
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,529
where the shackle goes in and you can
reset it to most of most of the systems

357
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:42,539
i've seen such a random but once it
alleges I was being a luggage most as a

358
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:49,640
pretty easy to reset your question
