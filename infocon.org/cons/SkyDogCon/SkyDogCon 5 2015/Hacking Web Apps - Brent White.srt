1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,770
and bright white and talk to you about

2
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,630
hacking web apps and this is more of an
injury or so of this is something that

3
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,460
you're wanting to get into your
interested in you know testing security

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:34,150
posture of your web after you've created
or your company or your dev team this is

5
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,129
geared towards this kind of helping you
start on the right track someone talked

6
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:41,580
about as a pen tester what I do

7
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:49,879
from the client kickoff call all the way
basically to reporting so feel free to

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,070
ask me questions as we go

9
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,770
standard non-disclosure their positive
value and read it if you're interested

10
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,580
so there's a few things that happen
before we start digging in and really

11
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,220
hacking away at web apps we have a
client kick-off call this is basically

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,619
where the client tells us what we're
looking at we talk about our limits you

13
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:24,319
know typically we don't perform denial
of service or anything like that on the

14
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:31,420
hosts that's pretty standard the rules
of engagement document this is where we

15
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,929
define the limits as far as ok when can
we just do you want us to do that

16
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:45,130
heavier noisier automated scanning after
hours and manual scanning 24 about 70

17
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,270
just let us know what works best for you
and then of course we talk about the

18
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,420
scope which is you know that you are all
whatever the application is like where

19
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,470
it's located and then in case all hell
breaks loose

20
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,209
we had the point of contact that way if
it stops responding or something has

21
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,759
gone bad or even if we just have a
question we know who that we need to

22
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,569
contact

23
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:15,738
so the first thing I want to mention
evidence-gathering

24
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:20,010
I know when I first started testing and
I was going through there are things

25
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,810
that I found and then when it came time
to write the report lot of cussing

26
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:32,590
because I didn't take screenshots or I
didn't document get and POST request and

27
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:40,459
response or whatever it was I didn't I
didn't write down your record that

28
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:44,889
needed evidence and so that made the
report writing very hard and even

29
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,469
delayed sometimes because actually had
to go back and do part of the assessment

30
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:53,370
again so that could tell the client how
I broke their stuff

31
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,689
show more you can let you can never
collect too much evidence if you don't

32
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:05,569
need it just don't use it but make sure
that it's there in case you do ok what

33
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:10,548
do I use for evidence gathering I like
to use keep note and Cali it's also

34
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:17,000
available for Windows and Mac OS and if
you're not familiar with that it's it's

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,729
pretty easy to use just make new pages
you can throw and we soar scripts and/or

36
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:29,109
you know screenshots whatever you want
to and it's just super easy rapport and

37
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:34,939
then if you get if you got to share the
information you can export it as HTML

38
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:41,888
pages automatically if the client wants
all of your honor a way that all do

39
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:49,989
things are usually Beitel usually group
them together by vulnerability you can

40
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,139
see a couple of it kind of depends on
the size of the assessment so if I have

41
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:58,979
several hosts several different web apps
by that or if it's just wanted to web

42
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:04,919
apps then I'll usually just grew by
vulnerability and as you can see I have

43
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:12,220
a color-coded shown the more severely
critical I have those as the dark red

44
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,480
and serious be read and so on the green
those are quick reference for me to know

45
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,490
that those pages with just just basic
information you know what my credentials

46
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,620
are for the application during the
assessment things like that there's so

47
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,590
many different ways just kind of
personal preference

48
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,640
it took me a while to sort of figure out
what works best for me so you're

49
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,460
probably gonna go through that to you
that something that you haven't gone

50
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:45,010
through already you're probably change
how you organize your information

51
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:52,940
several times what do you record while a
web apps you want to make sure that

52
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,640
anything you're sending to the
application of the HTTP requests to

53
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,740
document those and you also want to
document the response that way the

54
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,180
client can see what what payloads you
want to call it that you sent what

55
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,390
strings you sent to the application to
break it so that they can go back and

56
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:18,860
you know replicate this themselves for
the deaths that way I can see you know

57
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,180
they can break it on their own and then
when they were mediated they can test

58
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:31,260
themselves and see if it isn't factor
mediated anytime that you create

59
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,719
additional accounts or anything like
that to you want to make sure that if

60
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,890
you're not able to delete those yourself
at the end of the assessment just make

61
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:46,430
sure to let the client know so that they
can get rid of that extra Dadda an

62
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,210
important thing I've actually seen
consultants screw up with this where

63
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,530
they actually post some big hacks that
they've made online not cooled probably

64
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:05,510
against your disclosure agreement as
well so don't do that

65
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:14,440
so when you're getting your screenshots
make sure that it's it's legible make

66
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,520
sure that when you put this in the
report is it going to be something that

67
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,609
the client can read or when you shrink
it down to fit on the pages are going to

68
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,290
be so small that they can't tell what it
is just make sure that you consider

69
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:37,040
those things when you're collecting your
your evidence for example this

70
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,570
particular screenshot with a pretty big
sequel data base jump that I did and

71
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,330
there are so many columns that it was a
gigantic in June so basically what I did

72
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,130
was trimmed it down and got what I
thought you know some of the more

73
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:59,260
sensitive information and put that in
there but again it was just pages and

74
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,010
pages so sometimes you will have to do
some image editing some basic image

75
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:10,140
editing to get these to fix correctly in
the report but I'm sure we all know

76
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:19,169
basic image editing hopefully it's not
Google helps

77
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:26,840
talked about HTTP requests and responses
so whenever you're documenting the

78
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,169
request you don't want the client after
sit there and and scrape through a

79
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:35,688
single request to see ok what the hell
broke my code you know what did you

80
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,979
actually so it helped them out as you
can see just highlight

81
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:45,378
whatever whatever it was that you broke
the site with so in this particular case

82
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:51,009
you can see I highlighted just the basic
single injection just testing for single

83
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:58,810
injection vulnerability so you can see
how I have occurred in the grey box that

84
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,610
way when they're going through and see
it they the code is all grouped together

85
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,650
instead of looking like all the other
texts because that would get messy and

86
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:18,029
hard to read otherwise so their previous
page received a user ID key parameter

87
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,259
that was vulnerable to seek an injection
you want to make sure that your testing

88
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:28,169
all parameters on that page and you want
to document every single parameter that

89
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,718
is vulnerable don't just document one
document everything that's that's

90
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,510
vulnerable so that the client knows
exactly what needs to be fixed so but

91
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,630
when you when you're boarding you only
need to show one example and then you

92
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:50,600
can do a table a table with the
parameter name and then the URLs that

93
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,260
that vulnerable parameter was found on
so that didn't make sense hopefully it

94
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:04,370
did twenty afterwards and I'll show you
some examples

95
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:10,110
methodologies make sure you're gone by
you know standard methodologies such as

96
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,480
I kind of see these as a good guideline
almost like a checklist if you want to

97
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,910
call it that just to make sure that I am
providing a thorough assessment every

98
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,620
time do you start to do them for a while
you might get used to doing certain

99
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,970
things and get a little more laps and
what you should and and forget things so

100
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,550
having a methodology to go by is a great
thing I'm not saying only stick to that

101
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,969
methodology because there's going to be
certain things that might not be in it

102
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,270
but I'm just saying use that is kind of
a general guideline to make sure that

103
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,390
you're not forgetting something

104
00:09:48,390 --> 00:10:00,830
ok so before I start really digging into
the application one of the first things

105
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:07,330
I do is try to use utilize open source
intelligence gathering and I'll go and

106
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,230
try and fine see how big the footprint
is for the website so it's a if it's a

107
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,880
bank for example I'll go on all search
for development forums all the email

108
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,300
archives

109
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,410
anything that I can find where I am
getting results from employee email

110
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,260
addresses or the company name and there
have been several times where I've gone

111
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,689
by doing this and this is very
time-consuming it's not something you

112
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,860
can just breeze through expect good
results you need to make sure that

113
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,650
you're devoting some time to this and
really digging in there have been

114
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:52,150
several times where I've actually found
entire data base emos and information

115
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:58,720
that developers posted on development
help forums and they were a little bit

116
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,810
older and so they were archives and it
didn't require authentication to that

117
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:09,170
group but the information was still
relevant and help me leverage attacks so

118
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,569
you know it's look for that and if
social engineering is involved as well

119
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:21,380
then you can find out names of guys that
are and development department heads and

120
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,880
and the company or any other information
like that so make sure that you really

121
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:37,390
dig in to this also I found leaked
credentials for a client that had

122
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,350
already been hacked and wasn't aware we
help them figure that out because they

123
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,350
had leaked credentials online

124
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,360
not not a good thing at all but it's
something that we were able to provide

125
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:58,020
IT as a Service just by being diligent
open source intelligence is mentioned

126
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,740
found data base types keenness test
credentials and help forums everything I

127
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:12,959
was still valid so if your dad and you
are getting help online for you know an

128
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,939
issue that you're running into with your
code or something you try to get some

129
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,600
help debug get her something like that
if you post it on their make sure you

130
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,760
sanitize it just changed the names of
their job the name of your columns or

131
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,880
something like that just just change it
just enough where when someone is doing

132
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,279
something like what I do and they find
this it doesn't matter because it's been

133
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:40,380
sanitized and it's not relevant but it's
still close enough where you can get the

134
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:47,439
assistance that you need and if you give
someone temporary access to help you out

135
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,839
and debug something make sure you turn
it off when they're done and don't just

136
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:59,040
forget about it because we'll get in
that way to some other tools that I use

137
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,490
for this I like discover by Lee Baker
it's just a quick and dirty tool that

138
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,779
will go and do

139
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:14,730
searches for you know I domain for names
of ppl has some good parsers on it as

140
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,639
well

141
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,769
can also see if you need it you can help
crack wifi and parse XML file is quite a

142
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:32,160
few things that it does it's pretty neat
or recommend that I made it scanning ok

143
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,860
you're supposed to be a hacker why are
you

144
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:45,910
cantors well yeah super lazy know what
the amount of time that we have when we

145
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,860
do this assessment that usually couple
of weeks and so the great thing about

146
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,779
automated scanning is that they find a
lot of low-hanging fruit really quick so

147
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:03,899
it covers a lot of ground saves a lot of
time but don't just rely on those

148
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:12,509
because a vulnerable vulnerable to scan
is not a test just a vulnerability scan

149
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:18,910
so don't just rely on that

150
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:36,569
so again once can is not those who say
it is there you go to talk a little more

151
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:41,450
about automated scanning you still want
to make sure that you validate their

152
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,360
findings so if it says that there's
cross-site scripting on several pages

153
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,760
don't just get document that replay that
see if you can take that further instead

154
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:57,230
of just super lame pop up of 14 XSS

155
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,900
something else in there can you can you
do remote file inclusion can you bring

156
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:07,050
in you know some sort of JavaScript that
a keylogger something so many of those

157
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,790
tools are out there and just just really
dig in and take time to see how far you

158
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:18,420
can take that cross site scripting
attack is it is it on its side as its

159
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,520
tour just you know check that out and
just don't just rely on the automated

160
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:29,430
scanner go to the man who verification
there again and documented and make sure

161
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:35,010
you include on your report if it's not
there you can just ignore it and tell

162
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:43,689
the scanner that it's too but they like
that Nexus is another good one looks at

163
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:50,170
the host pretty well quickly show again
this is just a few checks when we start

164
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,949
to see you are there any glaring holes
that we can go after you know right away

165
00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:00,660
IBM at stan is a really good one at that

166
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,839
that's pretty extensive that works at
the a pretty extensive but again you

167
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:11,120
still need to verify the results

168
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,120
ok automated scanning

169
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,490
340 you're going to hear it talk about
this quite a bit I love this this

170
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,660
program so it has a built-in automated
scanner active scanner spire during

171
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:31,400
several other add-ons that you can get
especially in the pro version Nick to is

172
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:38,339
also good for finding you know admin
pages are known CGI vulnerabilities or

173
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:46,100
default pages things like that this is
this is open source too by the way it's

174
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,210
also a nick is also built into Nexus but
if you enable that i'm gonna warn you

175
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:56,230
that adds a hell of a lot of times your
Nexus can show usually what I do is all

176
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:02,200
let Nexus finish and then I'll go and it
and put that application through Nick to

177
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:08,920
and do separate tools in a row of
everything i watch you don't want to

178
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,130
flood it you don't want to flood
yourself and and we're just waiting

179
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:23,429
forever for stuff to finish WTS can this
is for frame WordPress framework site

180
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:28,770
there are also other tools and a lot of
them calm in Cali already for like

181
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:34,240
Drupal and Joomla and other frameworks
scanners this popular scanners that will

182
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,309
go through and they're specifically for
those frameworks to look for known

183
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:46,580
vulnerabilities so for example of WP
scan it would point out if the if it's

184
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,720
an outdated version so that's something
that you would want a report to the

185
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,230
client that they need to stay on top of
updates if they have the old tim thumbed

186
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:03,610
up PHP script that that was horrible to
several tax will tell you what these

187
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,870
they're using that way if that team has
no

188
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:13,340
exploits you can try to leverage those
and you can also enumerate the usernames

189
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:22,010
extremely easy for WordPress

190
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,750
dura buster this is a good tool takes a
bit of time but it's good for finding

191
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,830
hidden directories that weren't found
earings spire during phase so this is

192
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,309
good to let it run if you do you have an
application that's pretty solid and

193
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:41,300
you're trying to you're just trying to
find anything else anything extra to

194
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,730
leverage this is a good tool you can do

195
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:50,190
brute forcing through it or you can read
several lists that actually come with

196
00:18:50,190 --> 00:19:00,640
application already have known directory
names any questions so far

197
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,700
feel like I'm going through this fast
yes I did in Derby

198
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:23,020
command line version of this i really do
to launch doorbuster as I just talked

199
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,670
about during command line I'm never
tried the interface of it is I like the

200
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:33,280
simplicity of just point and click
interface to give a shot as are their

201
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,270
performance

202
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:55,990
there by default and you have to say
they are now saying what this one the

203
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:01,400
default ones for this one are are really
going to pretty pretty big actually you

204
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:08,220
can do it even comes with a list where
it has capitalized first letter

205
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,750
capitalized names and version where it's
all lower case to show that comes in

206
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,990
handy

207
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:32,820
they put inside zap ok cool yeah I
haven't haven't upgraded yet so a lot

208
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,500
more to do with I'm sure you can
probably just the old one on there too

209
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:48,190
that sounds can be under bus did you
have preferred settings as far as number

210
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:54,540
of threads and you go into going into
each folder and so I just kind of

211
00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:01,260
depends depends and get a feel for the
app it's super super slow server you

212
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,700
know obviously you wanna

213
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,300
for all things like that but you know if
it's just that all the time running

214
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,580
right away I'll just let it go and see
if it finds anything and usually you can

215
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,210
tell pretty quick if you're is wasting
your time

216
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,880
the observation that it seems that a lot
of IDS detect things like your normal

217
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,000
Metasploit tax and so for some reason
they don't like a look on a shit ton of

218
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,730
four or five hundred which is generally
ton of $500 boilers but I used to get

219
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,930
past so most people don't have something
in place and ideas to detect that there

220
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,110
have been instances on particular
applications where I've let this run for

221
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:49,050
a little while and also will stop itself
because it just carries out and I'm not

222
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:54,680
I don't exactly remember what I PSR
ideas or whatever was that they were

223
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,400
using but it actually blocked my traffic
for a period of time and I had to wait

224
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,450
and start again so then eventually I had
to throw it down so low that it wasn't

225
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:13,260
really helped me out at all so I moved
on to something else so yeah I think

226
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,680
that's actually what I think that was
not security because so many requests

227
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,610
that it just cut it out and then we're
just got so many errors it just stopped

228
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,639
itself

229
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,910
yeah

230
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:40,360
that is specifically for PHP and is it
is that that's what any badges are and

231
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,879
it's basically where you can go and
change the modified the security for

232
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:54,260
things like education and probably
someone that's technically minded and we

233
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,670
could explain a little bit better but
that's the super high level explanation

234
00:22:59,670 --> 00:24:23,040
of it anybody else want to add on to
that

235
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:30,530
there's quite a few that installing Kali
already there's several open source

236
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:37,240
options and you can see that this is
probably outdated now since there's a

237
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,110
new version of Cali but the old when
this was accurate so I need to update

238
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:48,340
this after I upgraded eventually too
slow

239
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:56,040
fertilizer issues about it that's why I
haven't done it yet so few tips for

240
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,590
automated scanning don't just put in the
URL and click Run is going to cause

241
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:07,540
problems probably you don't want to find
out just off client call you at two or 3

242
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:13,830
a.m. asking why stuff is broken and it's
because you wanted to host or you know

243
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:19,550
you have safe checks turned off or
whatever whatever it is so make sure

244
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,889
that when you are using an automated
scanners that you know what it is that

245
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:32,730
it's doing look at the settings to flood
the host so you need to throw it down

246
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,800
you need to check the performance and
see initially is it is it flooding it

247
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,580
isn't just making it so slow

248
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:48,240
are you getting timeout things to pay
attention to their the kickoff call the

249
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,120
client usually will ask are there any
pages are functions that you want to

250
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,520
avoid you know what that's like a
contact form you don't want your

251
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,830
automated scanner submitting you know
thousands of emails to their contact

252
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:08,179
form and really having giving somebody a
bad day so make sure you ask that and

253
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,430
then when they if there are things that
they wanted to avoid make sure that you

254
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:16,440
specify those in the automated scanner
diligent take a lot of notes that way

255
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,890
you can go back and reference each each
page

256
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:29,430
and make sure that you're not you're
taking the client some issues that I

257
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:35,910
found page not found it they'll come
back as 200 ok so if you're doing spy

258
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:41,220
during or something then you have a
gigantic list of your entire dictionary

259
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,690
from your scanner showing as legitimate
pages for the application which is

260
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,670
terrible to sort through so those go
through and specify those error 404

261
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:57,900
pages and if you need to put in a
specific area 200 you know what their

262
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,830
correct size and everything that way it
knows it's not really a page take the

263
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,790
time to do that

264
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,240
figuring the login process so its
application that requires authentication

265
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,590
you want to look at it as an
unauthenticated user and then you also

266
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:21,040
want to go back and look at it as an
authenticated user which you also want

267
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,110
to ask are there different levels of
authentication is their admin level and

268
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,590
then standard user or is everyone the
same saying whether when they walk again

269
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,399
so those are things you want to ask for
things that you want to configure in the

270
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:41,000
scanners well they did I mention before
you have to take time to verify the

271
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:54,790
results to weed out any false positives
when you're ready

272
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:01,010
again as I mentioned with automated
scanners once once it's done it's

273
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,900
legitimate document it

274
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,500
see how you can leverage that don't just
document it and move on

275
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,660
really dig into it to see if maybe you
can change a few things together and

276
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,150
leverage your talk that way

277
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,030
example that says they're sequins action
tricycle injection exploit see if you

278
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:32,810
can dump the data base if you can get it
shall host oh yeah there's tons of

279
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:39,320
questions so vulnerable vulnerable web
apps I think that's the name of it and

280
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,899
there are several that you can download
100 steven has a few that you their vote

281
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,640
virtual machines

282
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,789
ok

283
00:28:51,789 --> 00:29:03,899
okay shelley has a huge list of these
vulnerable web apps ya day now developed

284
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:13,850
by German doing so yeah and that's
that's a great question those are things

285
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:17,988
that you know if you get a new tool say
that you are familiar with testing web

286
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:22,210
apps but a new tool is out you want to
test that in your lab you don't want to

287
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:28,200
start using that tool for the first time
and testing it out on a client you know

288
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,039
on a production environment application
or just make sure that you try it at

289
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:39,389
home that way it really sucks then you
don't have to find out that it's what

290
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:51,199
the client being pissed off about
something make sure you manually look at

291
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,259
each page see what's going on any
parameters defined you want to hit those

292
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:01,239
and see if they are vulnerable to you

293
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:07,710
things like sequel injection or anything
just make sure that they are filtering

294
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:12,960
very well for all parameters don't not
just a couple but make sure that you're

295
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:22,869
doing a thorough job and and testing all
parameters you know I don't i I know

296
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:27,580
that some people like to use multiple go
back and forth it's it's a good program

297
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:33,759
but i guess i think im just so familiar
with 40 and that is just kinda hard to

298
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,629
stop and and figure out something else
when you already have something that

299
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:43,418
does that for you so that I have a lot
of friends other industries that pay

300
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:51,340
well I just I just never really taken
the time to dig into it all

301
00:30:51,340 --> 00:31:09,689
sometimes they'll tell you a little too
much exact versions of things and you

302
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,750
can use that to leverage your attack and
see if there is any experts out there

303
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:27,400
known exploits the stick to your list of
things taking notes if you wanna watch

304
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,900
this later but a few things to make sure
that you're looking for testing for

305
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:38,450
every application cross-site scripting
sequin LDAP injection local and remote

306
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:44,820
file inclusions cross-site request
forgery overall pretty powerful attacks

307
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,840
do some damage with those and obviously
your client wants to know if that's

308
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:56,280
something that they're vulnerable to
attacks by oscar has anybody used that

309
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:03,420
on on Windows it's a pretty cool at all
you can have to babysit a little bit but

310
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:09,320
it shows like three emulate SAT through
three different browser types and you

311
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,300
put in the URL and you can specify
different parameters but it will go

312
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:18,970
through a list and it will load the page
and all three browsers can it wait a

313
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,500
little bit and then it goes to the next
one and loads so it makes it look like

314
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,290
real you know real traffic speeds and
through its not super fast so you can

315
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,260
sit there and if if something pops if
you get cross-site scripting you can

316
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,850
posit and and copy that request and they
go try and take it further it's pretty

317
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:43,360
cool its last time I checked they only
had it for Windows but you know it's

318
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,409
useful I found a cross-site scripting
with that that other things and some of

319
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:54,850
my manual testing didn't get to go

320
00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:11,080
with your hands raised to look for a
passing mention any sensitive

321
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,570
information through get requests instead
of post so they had the username and the

322
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:24,110
password or the SessionID or anything
that could be used later on you know

323
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:29,540
maybe that page is being stored being
cached locally and so if your browser

324
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,480
gets exposed to something if someone
gets in your history and stuff and

325
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,770
that's cash are they going to have your
username or password or whatever it is

326
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:42,580
you want to see you're going to look and
see what's being passed through the get

327
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:49,590
requests look for comments and the
source code actually found some pretty

328
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,320
good information through developer
comments where they talk to each other

329
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,990
or were they fix something and wept the
old information in there and references

330
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:06,650
and I i have found that abrasion names I
found internal IP's user names and other

331
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:13,770
information that definitely should not
be in source code comments again it's

332
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:21,639
time consuming but it really pays off
using a bust and so forth are you going

333
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:27,100
insane chided extension for everything
else to find like back in da Tex

334
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:32,009
people who took the old source code and
dismayed at text version of it back up

335
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,550
those know to keep the old version but
in still kept the new version there

336
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,580
yeah and that's that's a good point to
is because I have found we found old

337
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:49,409
like sequel bottles and budget files and
got bak files PHP config and other

338
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,569
things show the doorbuster it will go
through and other tools to do this to

339
00:34:54,570 --> 00:35:03,040
you but they'll go through and look for
common and Bak index PHP . bak and so on

340
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,610
on because a lot of times people do
leave those those backup files on there

341
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,770
because they think well as on the server
it's not connected and that's basically

342
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:20,040
unusable filed because the extension has
been changed but what they don't realize

343
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,190
is those things can still be indexed by
Google or they can be found through

344
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:31,550
lists and especially when it's a config
file that has your data base and phone

345
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,270
York and data base config like user and
password

346
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:55,009
that's not a good thing now to prevent
and death by PowerPoint

347
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:08,950
indication that I found before our
security by obscurity so by going

348
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,870
through in looking at the source file
they will actually have the link to

349
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:18,859
adnan pages in there but they're not
showing it through because of a

350
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:25,290
javascript that from your login level it
prevents the admin page from show the

351
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,520
admin went from showing all you have to
do is look at the source code and then

352
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,190
go to the link and now you know settings
page and that's happened quite a bit so

353
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:41,800
security through obscurity is not a good
practice and that's something you can

354
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:48,190
help find just by digging in and looking
comments and source code and they're

355
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:54,880
also been a couple months ago and
assessment that I was doing I was able

356
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,230
to go through and fires as the security
by obscurity deal and I was able to go

357
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:07,940
through and construct a URL that set me
straight to a server status page and I

358
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,000
crafted and they told me basically told
me how to do this and their source code

359
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,140
where I was sending message I was
sending commands to their server as a

360
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:24,080
standard web user and send it to the
client saying hey I just got a response

361
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,340
from this my next command if you're ok
with it is to restart the server of

362
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,860
course this ain't no doubt its
production but it was a good enough

363
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,830
proof of concept and again you know if
you don't if you don't take the time to

364
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,370
find these things for your client who's
gonna find it for them that they don't

365
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:40,859
want

366
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:48,598
know so check those things out session
after you are off the SessionID still

367
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:55,640
good pace that somewhere else and still
use it or is it no longer good and you

368
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,660
have multiple sessions at the same time
that some people argue that's not really

369
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,700
a vulnerability

370
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:07,129
what are you saying that it depends on
the application so if for example if

371
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:13,440
it's something sensitive but maybe once
a banquet side if I log on I want to

372
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,079
automatically kill a session of somebody
else's logged on you know whether it's a

373
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:21,789
malicious user or whatever I think it's
just get practice especially if you're

374
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:26,089
doing money transactions or something
that seems like there could be potential

375
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:31,819
for some miscommunication between you
and whoever else has your login so

376
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:37,009
that's why I like to argue multiple
sessions at a time just you know that's

377
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:41,739
kind of Use Case talk to the client if
you do see that that's possible just

378
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:46,910
talk to the client say hey is a big deal
why does not matter for your website so

379
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:54,249
I password requirements so many
passwords they'll give me some crazy

380
00:38:54,249 --> 00:39:02,029
password to use for the test and all go
and change it to ABC 123 right away and

381
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:06,859
then I'll change the password again to
ABC 123 because they allow you to use

382
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:11,739
old passwords over and over with low
requirements and that's an issue because

383
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:19,160
you know that things are much easier to
brute force and so on

384
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:32,580
public access channels that's not good
for obvious reasons

385
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:38,750
cast in default credentials lookup
default account so they have tom cat

386
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,640
available

387
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:46,710
lookup default credit for Tomcat
directory browsing I found some really

388
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:53,260
interesting information just because
directory browsing was enabled and

389
00:39:53,260 --> 00:40:00,970
including like a full list all internal
employee I D pictures that they used for

390
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:11,299
their badges so that was a good find and
text files with company information and

391
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:19,240
it all because directory browsing wasn't
able

392
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:25,700
can work for dangerous acct method it's
quite often I'm able to get shell on a

393
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:31,460
server just because put method was
unable so I put my own code laudanum

394
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,650
scripts are pretty good for that check
those out there are they able to things

395
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:47,970
like directory traversal hartley et
cetera and see what their SSL TLS

396
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:57,118
settings are we all know that as a cell
pls is not really the greatest anymore

397
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,200
issues but there are recommended
settings so check that out do your

398
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,399
research and see what the latest
recommendation is for what ciphers you

399
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:19,369
should be supporting 1.1

400
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:29,609
check out there is an area you're not
really sure how to check for once a

401
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:34,788
cross-site request forgery or scripting
something like that the methodology will

402
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:39,450
help you figure out what it is you're
supposed to look for and then you can go

403
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:45,009
look up these things and practice in
your lab don't ever practice on climate

404
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:57,119
and environment then ago that's that's
basically it for the slide and I've got

405
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,980
got some time with you guys have more
questions are incentives quite a bit of

406
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:21,430
information and more than happy to talk
to anybody even have afterwards

407
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:27,569
now usually because of time constraints
we will give them this is the IP the

408
00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:32,619
traffic is coming from and we asked them
to whitelist us that way we don't have

409
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:37,890
to try and get through their ideas ideas
because that's daunting takes a lot of

410
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:42,190
time unless it's a very special case
where they want us to

411
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:48,540
incident response or something like that
but that's that's rare because I get

412
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,170
started in the industry

413
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,619
things happened so quick that we'd asked
him hey can you just basically remove

414
00:42:54,619 --> 00:43:00,390
these steps for us for time sake and
that way when we're on automated

415
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,040
scanners and things like that or not
being blocked then we can just you know

416
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,430
we can get through the assessment and
and try and see the application is

417
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:13,640
accurate as possible as if we were in
their building so that's a good question

418
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:21,348
as far as army askance concern I'm
abused

419
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:26,680
sparked an economics and so forth but
they all seem to not even be as good and

420
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,140
usable is sweet automated scanning
functionality is anything you'd

421
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:37,279
recommend is poised good I made
commercial scanners or IBM apps can

422
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,049
pretty good I like that when you know
you can tell a different automated

423
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:45,750
scanners they all kinda have their
strengths and weaknesses so I like

424
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:51,599
that's why I like to use a few different
ones but the one that I've had the best

425
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,740
luck with so far as far as how in depth
it goes is IBM abscam so and I'm sure

426
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:03,149
there are others out there there and I
used to use a kinetics as well but you

427
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:10,099
know I had issues with the flooding the
host and just having even we can run in

428
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:18,150
response on this while running a system
of good and then I also don't like the

429
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:25,690
way that it sorts out the request and
response how you had that sort of dig

430
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:31,990
through and it's not really easy to copy
and Ryan and replay those attacks so I

431
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,828
guess it's just kind of personal pref

432
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:38,890
personal preference but just try
different ones cuz you will get you'll

433
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,670
see some different results depending on
the white automated scanners to use yeah

434
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,469
we like the shows you dis is why we
think this particular vulnerability

435
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:51,789
exists here you can look at the attack
and then they tried to manually and

436
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:57,160
another great thing about burp suite 400
is that it's actively developed and so

437
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:04,140
there are rate great plugins that you
can add 300 I'm not sure if you can do

438
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,759
that on the free version but I know the
pro version they have so many actually

439
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:21,029
hadn't so like dole has one so you can
plug in July dress or cleanup JavaScript

440
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:23,479
to help make it much easier to read

441
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:31,029
have some that will take ASP you know
all that garbage will decode and just

442
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:36,479
clean it up for you there's just so many
things that help save time there's also

443
00:45:36,479 --> 00:45:40,788
a plug into which is cool where it will
audit few if you have a parameter that

444
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:45,569
you think might be vulnerable to seek
injection you can take that and and just

445
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:50,420
click a button and it will put it
through the sequel map plugin through

446
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:55,160
bird and automatically start running for
you so you're not having to you know

447
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,069
take that person reading makefile open
sequel MapPoint the file and do all that

448
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:07,069
it just does it for you and say it's
quite a time so check that out

449
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:11,459
web development languages you see you
like instantly as a Pinterest awesome

450
00:46:11,459 --> 00:46:18,749
happy ColdFusion in PHP about you happy
points asp.net generally is not as easy

451
00:46:18,749 --> 00:46:23,049
but it's a trend you see as far as I
felt like it is that people are some

452
00:46:23,049 --> 00:46:28,599
languages that lend themselves to
screwing up yeah my favorite are when

453
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,619
they when they use open source or the
big frameworks you know I can imagine

454
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:40,269
WordPress or Drupal or Joomla and then
my second would be like cold fusion

455
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:43,750
cause that is cold fusion

456
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:53,810
and and then PHP CMS care about them to
me what's called now is that even then

457
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:58,460
the JUCO itself my standing is pretty
good but all those plugins

458
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:04,060
put all the different continent systems
that's what people are outdated or they

459
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,340
don't check the validity of a plugin
before they throw it in there and so

460
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:17,920
it's a mess there are ways to hard and
so I know for me personally a few

461
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,280
websites that I have I do use WordPress
and I think it's kind of a way for me to

462
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,910
challenge it's almost like you know I
don't know why do they have a glutton

463
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:31,520
for punishment or whatever but they're
from doing that I force myself to learn

464
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,970
ways to harden it and I'll do
assessments against myself against us

465
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:39,459
the sites regularly to keep pardoning
those

466
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,590
just think it's just a weird game I like
to play where I can see if I can

467
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:49,040
actually take something like WordPress a
magazine that's ok we don't think so but

468
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,620
it's it's I haven't had any issues and
you can you can hardly ever doing that

469
00:47:54,620 --> 00:48:00,049
most people if they if they're building
a website on something like that it's

470
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:03,120
because they're needed something quick
and dirty and they usually are going to

471
00:48:03,120 --> 00:50:04,500
take the time to hard-hit

472
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:12,720
make sure you're going through in
looking at the source code responses and

473
00:50:12,720 --> 00:51:05,200
everything because you'll find some good
stuff

474
00:51:05,200 --> 00:52:06,930
that's actually pretty funny that's what
the world needs

475
00:52:06,930 --> 00:53:09,328
actually pretty common actually get

476
00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:13,700
yeah that's nice tits like the robot
that text file for your assessment

477
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:23,310
thanks

478
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:28,860
time you guys have more questions I'll
be outside
