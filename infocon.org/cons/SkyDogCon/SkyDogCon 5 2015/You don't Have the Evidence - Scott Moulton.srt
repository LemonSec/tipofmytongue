1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,970
so for those of you who don't know like
for the last two years a pretty much

2
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:28,040
taken a break and I i spoke at every con
for like everybody saw me everywhere for

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,439
ever and I rotated only ever did
speeches two times in a row that's the

4
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,720
most I've ever done this is this is a
speech i heard yesterday from driver

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,809
when he knew speech so I was in Dec on
Monday I just gave a speech at the cyber

6
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:50,070
crime security Nexus which is the first
the first version of this new conference

7
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,660
where they're trying to everybody this
is going to be all you're gonna hear

8
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,430
from now on our cause I've already heard
this from a hundred different colleges

9
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,730
and everything it's all going to be
cyber cyber cyber cyber world the word

10
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,129
that we tried to get rid of a decade ago
we're back and we're going to do is talk

11
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:10,619
about cyber everything so cyber security
cyber forensics cyber sex yes with

12
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:23,380
robots there is a con for robot sex they
just cancelled it that is correct so K

13
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:32,298
setting get picked up on the mic because
no one came that was pretty funny so you

14
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:40,479
can go on the comment section anyway so
I this is kind of a revisit of a speech

15
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,280
I did a speech two years ago astrakhan
and it was about fuhrman's examiners and

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
said this is a refresh of what happened
in the last two years with forensics

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,479
amateurs and I personally for those of
you who don't know who I am so just

18
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,110
ignore anything to says CSX on it that
was what I did Monday so I don't have

19
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:05,200
enough time to put yes I don't think so
in this particular assets I do forensic

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,399
I actually do criminal forensics and I
do and it's all digital stuff so cell

21
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,549
phone computers equipment I deal with a
lot of criminal cases some what you see

22
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:14,590
in the news

23
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,690
sometimes I'm in the news things like
that happened and I also have a data

24
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,680
recovery company I have a corporation
that we actually receive drives in

25
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,819
in we do repairs we fix them we recover
his data and then we send it back out to

26
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,319
you so we do them kind of side by side
so in the forensic side is all the

27
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,578
paperwork and all the other stuff that
happens and then in 2002 to 2007 2008 I

28
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:44,049
wrote a class on how to do forensic data
recovery so in other words polling heads

29
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:47,980
out of drives reassembling the drives
repairing them doing forensics images

30
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,290
from those and getting back the data
that the police officers can get back or

31
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,280
the that a lot of entities FBI CIA and I
teach his class all over the world have

32
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,889
taught to just about every agency all
over the world so my problem is this

33
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:07,599
forensics amateurs literally suck
forensics imagers as a whole there has

34
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,040
been almost no absolutely zero
improvement in the forensics amateurs in

35
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,349
the last 30 years every time something
comes out and that's the premise for

36
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:22,018
this talk everything that comes out
using the same colonel the same didi

37
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,739
engine to basically copy everything from
the Dr now data recovery which if you're

38
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,669
thinking of forensics and my mind when I
started doing forensics and then started

39
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,250
a data recovery company now it's been 16
years I thought that data recovery was

40
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,280
going to kind of be like well you go to
a chiropractor and they also give

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,329
massagers so the massage would just be
you know the extra stuff and it's kind

42
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,530
of the fluff that kinda goes with that
so did you keep making more money or do

43
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,169
something else

44
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:53,650
data recovery is far more extensive than
forensic data recovery in the data

45
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,169
recovery community know far more about
hard drives than any forensics guy

46
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:03,959
you'll ever meet on planet earth besides
maybe me but there's a lot of data

47
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,930
recovery guys out there that know even
far more about drives and I could

48
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,989
possibly tell you after spending every
minute of my life doing this last 16

49
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,290
years so they're really far more
advanced than almost all the friendly

50
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,320
skies the only difference is they don't
have the paperwork they don't handle the

51
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,509
cases they don't do the legal side so
they don't know what they're doing with

52
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,599
that kind of stuff and text really are
scared by that they really don't

53
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:27,810
communicate they have no ability to
really speak and handle something like

54
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,039
testifying in court which I do all the
time but at least from the standpoint

55
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,090
none of the forensic people that are
doing this

56
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,049
any of the knowledge that the data
recovery people do or the tools so I'm

57
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,750
gonna demonstrate this to you and I'm
gonna come to show you what we're

58
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,110
dealing with as a whole from the
standpoint so so right near the first

59
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,540
problem I have is that forensics people
are gathering evidence from hard drives

60
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,410
and then using that in court cases and
they're missing stuff there they imaged

61
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,410
drives are missing sectors are all kinds
of problems and they are you using these

62
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,300
and many times to decide or the judge is
deciding whether or not you're gonna go

63
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,220
to jail for the rest of your life for
you know your physical life is at stake

64
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,450
whereas data recovery people have some
of the very powerful extensive tools

65
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,110
that can get every single sector back
that the that the guy who's doing

66
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,110
forensics missed for your porn so they
can get your porn collection is

67
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,060
literally like 90% of data recovery jobs
are you know I would like my QuickBooks

68
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,520
database but I really like my porn also
so that's a normal thing and I can I get

69
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,198
paid to look at porn that's really
ultimately what we look we're talking

70
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:42,770
about at this point so so thank you guys
so anyway so as we're moving on here so

71
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,030
when you're doing forensics a lot of
forensics tools out there they're really

72
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,950
doing things for Speed there's there are
software and I'm not primarily talking

73
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,620
about software because I will but as a
whole

74
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:03,849
anybody use in case anybody out there
doing forensics yes in case FTK other

75
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:07,320
types of copiers like disc jockey and
things like that you guys anybody use

76
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,150
any of those kind of things there's some
low in one's now you can buy at the

77
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,989
store we just push a button on the
little black box and copies are drawn

78
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,320
from one to another

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,500
anybody dealing with any of those I'm
sure that somebody here is also doing

80
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,260
corporate stuff for you have to clone
them and use something like ghosts and

81
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,960
then distribute them back out through
the networks this kind of thanks yes ok

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,060
so the problem with most of those is
Pete most of those tools the software

83
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,229
tools a lot of things they're fairly
slow they're usually limited to the

84
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:36,070
speed that you're able to plug stuff and
in the hopes that you're right blocker

85
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,169
in the content that you're trying to
protect along the way does a good job so

86
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,710
a lot of friends it's guys will go out
there by third-party tools now this

87
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,580
particular one right here this one

88
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,840
there's there's a several through their
called tttt 12 and three there's three

89
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,840
versions those are made by guidance
guidance makes in case and they bought

90
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,500
tableau so tableau is the company that
they now own and that's that's a tableau

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,930
and again there's three different
versions 281 282 283 and their

92
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,620
high-speed forensics amateurs and when I
say high-speed you normally without

93
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,680
hardly any effort plugin these drives in
and your imaging them to 300 gigs in our

94
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,099
basically the majority of them are gonna
reach that and beauty of these most of

95
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:23,349
the time is that they're very easy to
use because when you're walking into a

96
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,150
facility like a police are there there's
lawyers they're everybody's talking to

97
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,330
you is like any other consulting gig
that you ever do except they never leave

98
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,490
you alone so you're there at the table
all the time talking to these people but

99
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,960
still have to accomplish your job at the
same time so these tools make it

100
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,500
extremely easy for you to not do a damn
thing

101
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,240
literally you can plug on one side of
the drive to ones to your source and one

102
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,169
side of the drug test device into your
drive for your destination

103
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,159
hit a button and go that's literally
what you can do so but they have a lot

104
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:57,599
of advantages speed is is really the
primary one and getting rid of the dummy

105
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,909
cycle and then they also do verification
and spit things out and files and take

106
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:05,690
everything for you this is pretty much
the breadth of the majority of them that

107
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,830
are out there there's a lot more but as
a whole they really make no difference

108
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,979
and I'll try to explain those in a
second but this one down here and I've

109
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,440
got all these and I tried all these and
I've also got a whole lot more than what

110
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,690
we have here on the screen

111
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,819
this one right here is one that a
commonly used call the Falcon and you'll

112
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:25,710
see this little interface it's a really
cute interface because it looks exactly

113
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,680
like Star Trek so it's really nice when
you go to add that looks exactly has a

114
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,430
swoop in the whole thing that looks
exactly like Star Trek so I really

115
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,198
commend them on making it look really is
the only star trek interface I have on

116
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:41,228
all the devices that's useful so that's
kinda cool actually

117
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,820
and very efficient I was more surprised
that you could actually use the Star

118
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,600
Trek interface and it'd be efficient so
we're going to talk about all these

119
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,040
names now most of these tools if there
is a problem if there's an error on the

120
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,770
hard drive this is the biggest thing is
that if there is a single sector in a

121
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,000
lot of cases that fails

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,330
sometimes the toll just completely fail
sometimes if it can't figure out how to

123
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,920
continue it all just pad that sector
with zeros or mark something with zeros

124
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,990
but most of the time too tall fails it
doesn't copy the drive at all it just

125
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,640
stops if you get enough errors literally
none of the tools to make it through

126
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,290
many of them nor snow real software most
of the time and my problem again is that

127
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,770
there's a lot of things that you can do
that they don't do anything and I'm just

128
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,829
give me like a quick little list down
here in the bottom which is reverse

129
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,850
imogene ignore ECC multi but you don't
have to know what any of the stuff means

130
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,070
yet you will by the end of the talk but
the whole problem is is that forensics

131
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,850
has not improved as far as their imaging
process ever in 30 years of doing the

132
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,640
same stuff they've always done although
these other things are available so then

133
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,830
you ask the question why aren't the ads
they adding these things into their

134
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,420
tools they have hardware they have
equipment they could add all these

135
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,829
advanced features into their tools and
primarily its money but one of the other

136
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:04,520
things is rather than spend the money or
the time on doing things they don't even

137
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,390
want you to know that these other things
are capable and I have actual proof of

138
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,610
this that they're actually the companies
who make these tools are doing things to

139
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,930
try to stop other people from even
finding out about the data recovery

140
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,430
tools these advanced features and all
these other things that they could do

141
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,239
because why would you ever buy their
tools at all if these other tools did

142
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,040
everything so I have a specific instance
where I heard a story directly from the

143
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,790
one of the guys who runs one of the
companies called the Toler atoll is a

144
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,839
company is the data recovery company
that makes a new forensics amateur and

145
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,130
they were going to an incase conference
in case runs a big conference every year

146
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:50,770
for forensics people and it's called CIC
not anymore but it was as of last year

147
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,589
and they had a table just like every
other vendor that you know you you would

148
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,100
walk by their table and you can go see
theirself well I did a talking mood con

149
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,200
about how their stuff was trumping
everything that the images would do it

150
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,589
tableau guidance and everything else so
after I did this talk I actually got a

151
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:12,690
phone call from guidance and tableau
they spoke to me on

152
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,520
phone and started talking to me about
all these things that they wanted to add

153
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,060
to their imagers and all these things
that they needed to improve and I'm like

154
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,140
all right awesome accomplish this task I
think that they're actually gonna make

155
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,620
some changes in as forensics people we
might get better tools and then about

156
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,560
two days later I got a call from Dimitri
edit oligos I know what you did but it

157
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,939
worked my tables $50,000 now so we went
from $5,000 to $50,000 and he was told

158
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,690
directly that they didn't want him
showing up at any other conferences

159
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,760
because they didn't want anybody to see
competing products that do the things

160
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,470
that his product does they just wanted
to buy their stupid dumb piece of crap

161
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,090
and I have a huge problem with companies
that are doing stuff to stop technology

162
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,840
just because they don't want to pursue
money or spend money the charred

163
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,200
actually do something from a standpoint
of to improve the product so let's get

164
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,730
onto these kind of things so I i've
testified a number of times i've

165
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,110
testified in federal court

166
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:13,080
state or a number of smaller courts and
this is a common thing I see even from

167
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,340
agents and stuff that are sitting on the
stand they'll be asked did you were you

168
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,350
able to copy every sector on the drive
and they will say yes I have a hundred

169
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,840
percent of the drive copy now here's the
problem I have is that they don't really

170
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,030
understand anything about the drive and
what they actually are saying is they

171
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,640
don't know what they didn't get because
there's a huge amount of data that's

172
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,160
written to the dr they don't have access
to that actually might include user area

173
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,500
that might actually include users data
and so they don't even know the answer

174
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,310
to the question but the bigger problem
down here is the one where if they had a

175
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,500
problem or there was an error and they
did know about it then it was ok that it

176
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,610
was padded with zeros data recovery
people don't had it was ira's they'll do

177
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,250
everything they can to avoid it they try
to read every single sector and even if

178
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,830
a sector is damaged they can read half
of that are more they will actually keep

179
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,820
that content rather than just throw it
away so they didn't copy every sector

180
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,150
they didn't even have a chance to
there's a couple other things out there

181
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:15,750
that try to explain things but one so
even if there's nothing else I get a

182
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,790
point across on this talk is that one
thing is I will teach you some stuff

183
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,300
about hard drives one of the thing about
a hard one of things about hard drives

184
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,609
is this

185
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,190
smart which is self-monitoring analysis
and and reporting technology it is a

186
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,209
tool that's basically running on your
drive many of you have heard of it

187
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:36,469
because you run a little tool to make
sure that your drives healthy just say

188
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,029
okay or nothing they're pretty extensive
tests there's a lot of things that can

189
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,579
actually happen in smart but one of the
things that people who are doing

190
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,089
forensics images rely upon is what
something called a hash at the end of

191
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:55,040
copy in a hard drive they hashes they
can say well this algorithm says that I

192
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,449
have a good copy of the drive then they
verify it during the process of imaging

193
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:03,880
a drive the data can actually change so
from the beginning of starting the

194
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,980
imaging process to the end of the
imaging process if the drive to text

195
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,810
their some error there some reason why
can't read a sector it can actually mark

196
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,709
that is bad and substituted on the fly
and the result that they're actually

197
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:22,219
getting in the image won't include the
actual original content that was there

198
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,360
in the beginning now it's a rare it
doesn't happen every day and it's not

199
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,699
supposed to happen the majority of the
time but it can happen and smart is one

200
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:32,990
of these items that tracks it so if you
pull the table at the beginning you said

201
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,339
a smart me read all what your sector say
they are right now

202
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:40,750
a new image or driving at the end of
that number changed then it would

203
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,570
reflect that there was something that
was wrong so so this again is one of

204
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,079
those things where forensic people are
basically saying I have a half years my

205
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,979
result and this makes me good which is
it comes after the fact not before the

206
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,870
fact when you have something you've
already got a copy of it so you don't

207
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,290
know that it changed before you get a
copy of it so you're only getting a hash

208
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,069
on the result you're not getting a hash
on the origination since everybody

209
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,820
everybody clear this good alright so
here's one of the things that happens

210
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,170
there's something called a block
redirection so when and this is the

211
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:19,240
normal thing that blood drive happens
it's invisible to you your drive always

212
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,050
tries to present itself as if it's
perfect it does not want you to know

213
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,829
that it has errors and has problems no
drive even when you received them brand

214
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,170
new out of the box is perfect

215
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,120
they all have errors they all have
physical problems they all have sectors

216
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,410
that have been reallocated whether or
not they were done

217
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,629
manufacturing time or whether or not
they're done so in this particular

218
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:43,690
instance what we have is some bad luck
redirection these would normally be your

219
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,610
LBA block she would have 25 26 27 and
then you would have something to read

220
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,639
redirects if they sector is bad to
something in something called a system

221
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,379
table so there is a system area of the
drive that has allocated space so that

222
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:01,660
you can reallocate something if
something bad because you must always

223
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,620
have the same number of sectors you
cannot run out of the number of sectors

224
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,569
that you have and just diminish the size
so your partition should always remain

225
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:22,870
the same size here so ultimately any of
these things that happened there is no

226
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,279
way for them to know if they happen
after the fact now I know this will be a

227
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,220
little bit hard to see and I might be
able to zoom in a little bit this is a

228
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,620
smart table the data is pulled from a
smart table and there are at least

229
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,040
numbers that will tell you things now
there's not much of a standard there's

230
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,120
some problems with the standard as a
whole but they do try to track

231
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,860
reallocated sectors they try to track
whatever else has gone wrong and whether

232
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,569
or not they're still a problem and if
you read the table at the beginning you

233
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:52,759
can still read it at the end

234
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,410
now one of the other things in case
nobody knows this about solid state

235
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:03,610
drives solid state drives don't have all
of the same identifiers that hard drugs

236
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,679
have like they don't have hedge so they
don't need to keep track of certain

237
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,260
things for moving ahead or doing some
other things so solid state drives steal

238
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,869
the same locations for other data so if
you get a datasheet from your solid

239
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,819
state drive so because you're smart
information from a solid state drive it

240
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,299
won't make sense what they're actually
telling you for those locations is just

241
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:29,559
some bogus peace attacks that they fell
down and not telling you the real answer

242
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,289
you can actually go get your data she
for your solid state drive and look at

243
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:37,809
the table and then pull the table and
you can find out what those settings

244
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:41,899
actually are what they really mean
because all the stuff for smart normally

245
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,480
is for hard drives not for solid state
drives so you're just getting live to

246
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,250
when you're looking at

247
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,030
right off the bat but just know
datasheet and look at it from that

248
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,840
standpoint for your particular drive and
it will tell you now when forensics

249
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,560
people are imaging their drives this
would be a report that they would get at

250
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,570
the end of their imaging process and
you'll notice there will just be errors

251
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,110
where it cannot read something and then
just note them but they're filled with

252
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,270
zeros there's data that is missing on
the drive it could be a huge chunk it

253
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:21,930
could be a small chunk or it could be
not successfully at all and fail so 15

254
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:27,270
16 years ago when I started doing this
it was pretty rare for forensics to see

255
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:33,010
damaged hard drives so it's changed a
lot over the years over the last few

256
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:39,090
years I'm gonna tell you about 25% of
the drives I see in the field are bad so

257
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,419
we go out to a place where supposedly
the drive is good it's known to be good

258
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,790
because people are using this data on it
that we want and we go to image the

259
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,659
drive and there's a problem with the
drive 25% of the time that's a pretty

260
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,870
that's a pretty large number to go out
into the field to try to do 20 drives

261
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,370
and have five or six of them that are
going to be bad while you're out in the

262
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,100
field just a couple weeks ago this is a
picture from a job that I did probably

263
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:11,469
thirty days ago and so I took these at
this is a very hard copy this is a very

264
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,010
hard copy 3 and I had some hard drives
that when we hook it up when it was

265
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,800
imaging this is what I would say it was
just a task failed cannot recover and

266
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,100
then the device would die all you can do
at this point no matter how far along it

267
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,320
is in the process is either quit and
stop or go use another toll or do

268
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,980
something else in the hopes that you're
going to make it otherwise and a lot of

269
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,720
cases you can take the drive with you
sometimes on these jobs these are live

270
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,250
systems and you're an investigator
coming in to get a copy even if it's for

271
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,710
the federal government you gotta take
the copy with you you're not taking the

272
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,650
original so i cant take their driving
leave they're also going to blame me

273
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,120
they will blame me and say well the
reason that the drive went bad was

274
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,179
because you were messing with it is your
fault so that's the other problem is at

275
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,180
least if you can recover it then

276
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,510
you can come to nullify the whole thing
now only talking hardware we're not

277
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,960
talking about the loss of data which is
much more critical so these devices will

278
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,130
just fail physically in the field said
this was a small drop a 20 gig drive

279
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,970
that I was doing and it fails at 11 and
that's it

280
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,660
like after that you get nothing so you
don't get half of the drive in this

281
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,280
happens all the time and bigger drives
as well so you move to another device

282
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,990
this one is the Falcon with it pretty
Star Trek interface and basically this

283
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,260
is what they do they'll say here in the
account read errors but eventually it'll

284
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,310
just died right in the process you just
see it oh damn I'm done and it doesn't

285
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:37,010
make it any further it'll just count the
errors and again it's padding that area

286
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:42,220
area with zeros and then this is a tool
called X-rays forensics which i think is

287
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,110
probably one of the best forensics tools
that there is out there anybody using in

288
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,330
case and fck you should really just stop
and go get x-rays and take a look at

289
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:56,580
some x-rays will just pound in case and
FDA altogether but but in this

290
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,360
particular instance is trying to image
the drive and of course we still have a

291
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,409
problem with it can't do in software
either I have a better chance of doing

292
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,410
it with x-rays because I always has
three or four different kinds of ways I

293
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,170
can read drives I just didn't go through
all of them and may have eventually been

294
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:16,960
able to get it but it would have taken a
lot of time so here's here's where I'm

295
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,730
starting to say at least what every
image or should do regardless of whether

296
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,420
or not as forensics or data recovery so
so this is a critical one should you not

297
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,950
be able to power off the drive power the
drive back on and continue where you

298
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:34,880
left off so if you have a bad sector and
it's a problem when I just turn it off

299
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,840
move a couple sectors to the right and
then started again that seems like a

300
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,010
very logical thing that you should not
have to start all over again every

301
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,950
single forensics image out there pretty
much has to start all over again from

302
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,300
ground zero if you fail it never
continues can't go far from there

303
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,879
there's a little granularity in in case
where it can do a couple things with

304
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,080
this immature but otherwise everybody
else you have to start all over again

305
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,129
non-contiguous imaging they if you are
imogene

306
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,679
hard drive you have two images from the
beginning to the

307
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,090
end of the hard drive with any of those
other tools all of those tools that are

308
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,309
out there none of them think of it as
non-contiguous the sectors are what

309
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:20,440
matters it doesn't matter if the whole
drive was done in one fell swoop

310
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,879
if you can do chunks of the drive at
different times and put them in the

311
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:28,469
right place they're numbered there in
order so all you have to do is fill the

312
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,669
man that it would be very easy to fix
this problem and that kinda goes with

313
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,549
the other one is called reverse imaging
because let's say you know that 11 gigs

314
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:41,269
has a problem that too on the 28th
drives so I could read it from the other

315
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:46,549
end why can't I start at the beginning
to have a problem then go to the end and

316
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:51,470
go backwards till I meet the problem
that I had so data recovery imagers do

317
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,590
that every day not none of the forensics
tools do that not one of them

318
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,209
not a single one of them does any of the
things in this list and they are powered

319
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,590
devices they have their own control
there's absolutely no reason why they

320
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,330
couldn't do that except for the fact
that no one wanted to change the code

321
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,439
everybody's using some dumb didi engine
and they're not doing anything advanced

322
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:27,929
things at all to try to do that so in in
this list there's a couple of things on

323
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:31,909
I'll explain it as we get to it one of
these important things that people don't

324
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:37,509
seem to clearly understand his passwords
you know on heart physically on your

325
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:41,299
laptop when you powerful laptop and you
go into the BIOS you go into FIU have

326
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:45,639
options for adding a password to your
hard drive the physical password to the

327
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:50,070
hard drive right now I'm talking about
so that when you start up your computer

328
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,360
it won't go anywhere at all if you do
not enter that password and that's

329
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,840
really technically a hardware problem
from the standpoint of forensics dealing

330
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,629
with it because it's stored on the
platter there's a special area on the

331
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:05,908
platter where that data is stored and
that they did is also stored in clear

332
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:10,299
text by the way so the data is your
password is stored in clear text on the

333
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:14,799
hard drive it's just not accessible to
you it's in a special location in the

334
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,850
system area that's specifically known by
this laptop or by your your device

335
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,909
you're tall the thing is though

336
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:28,040
win that setting is on there is a
command that every time your drive

337
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,560
identifies itself there's a set of
commands it says I can do these things

338
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,620
so there's a list of these commands and
they're called dispatch sport and it's

339
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,330
really passport just like you have a
passport and has your information your

340
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,980
social security number whatever else on
it from this from that standpoint that's

341
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,940
exactly what this tool does as well and
they can tell you that there's a

342
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,000
password on the drive no forensics tool
does this what they do instead is they

343
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,850
just have error after error after error
they cannot read any sectors from the

344
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,500
drive so all they do is error out on
every single sector but they never

345
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,410
report you have a password on this drive
which would be a simple thing for them

346
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,440
to tell you even if you couldn't do
anything about it be a simple thing for

347
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,250
them to tell you there's nothing wrong
to drive there something wrong with you

348
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:20,490
have a password on this device none of
those tools again do this so this is a

349
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,380
tool that call at all I know it's a
little hard to read the thing that I

350
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,300
care about over here is the part that's
a little bit clearer which is that same

351
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,460
hard drive that we cannot read earlier I
threw it on this device and I was able

352
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,780
to read all the sectors now we know that
there was at least 21 errors on that

353
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,010
drive now this one picks up 55 cuz it
made it further than the other devices

354
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,200
did and so this is reading in a
particular way all of its any of the

355
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,660
other forensics tools could have read
this it would have fifty five sectors

356
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:54,320
padded 20 this tool actually read all 35
sectors and recovered the data from

357
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,540
those 55 sectors so physically did the
job and and wrote that to its correct

358
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,399
location rather than ignore it skip it
or just fail altogether and this is

359
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,110
common this is like a daily event that I
have in dealing with Dr to come in from

360
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,389
forensics that people can't read out
there in the field and I'm fine with

361
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,880
that because I make a lot of money
because they can't read their drugs and

362
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,720
I can read their drives with some
special equipment some special tools so

363
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,980
and I'll show this morning minute but
this tool is called anatole on disk

364
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,360
imager just totally forensic disk imager
one of the other tools and I'm using is

365
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,820
called the deepest part disk imager and
there is a no other more advanced tools

366
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,480
called a PC 3000

367
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,030
but that's what they call it so so when
I'm testifying in court now this is one

368
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:46,330
of the biggest things so the police put
a guy on the stand and he said yes i

369
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,449
image to strive and I did really well
but I missed you know twenty-four sector

370
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,910
so I missed a chunk of data to drive
Road 0 anyway so I had zero but that's

371
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,610
ok so small amount of data so he's
sitting on a standard he says that now I

372
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:07,139
go and I said on the stand I say well
there were 24 problems but I read all of

373
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,980
them and I actually know what data is
there so he has no idea what is there so

374
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,330
inherently the jury or someone else is
going to believe I am better than he is

375
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,340
so we've just completely invalidated
most of what the police might have said

376
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,419
or what the opposing cuz I could be on
the side of the prosecution as well so

377
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,470
but you know in 12 K there's plenty of
space to create doubt as well what was

378
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,830
in 12 K could have been a spreadsheet
the said Bob passwords and it was really

379
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,000
bob that did this crime so that's really
the question is that enough to create

380
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,240
doubt because a jury doesn't have any
idea how big 12 KS you guys might know

381
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,740
that is not very large but it could
contain IP addresses for example which

382
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,720
you know it doesn't need much space to
store some of this content when he's

383
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,480
four bytes so you have a lot of space
you can actually do stuff so in my mind

384
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,340
they really need to be more thorough
because I can pretty much trouble

385
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,090
whatever they're doing just by by
recovering that data so here's an

386
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,820
example where a lot of people will end
and I'm sure some of you have seen this

387
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,370
if you've done a physical recovery
yourself before you got a crash drive

388
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,969
you going to download some software you
recover some stuff and then you go to

389
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,210
look at on the drive and some of the
data is corrupt and this is what you get

390
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,320
sometimes for some of the pictures could
you could have had just a couple of

391
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,520
sectors that were bad right here but now
throws the algorithm off you could

392
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,650
actually have the rest of the picture
but you're missing a couple of sectors

393
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,490
so it throws the algorithm off and you
see trash and I've been in cases before

394
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,920
where they show me the top half of the
kids

395
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,530
or something like that and then they
assume what's going on below it

396
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,040
I've literally been in that case where
they assume what the rest of the picture

397
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,120
is and this is an example because you
know a lot of people say batman standing

398
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,080
at you know Gotham City and he's on the
square is on some steps or something

399
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,340
they'll say that this guy over here is
probably got a guitar or something like

400
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:57,560
that

401
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,550
else a whole bunch of things so if I
could recover the data and I could do it

402
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,720
in a specialized way wherever covered
the rest of that 512 bytes instead of

403
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,460
padding at 10 then I might actually get
a result looks more like this so it is

404
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,170
possible that you can come up with the
wrong conclusion based on these half

405
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,520
pitchers in these half things which is
why they normally don't let evidence

406
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,800
into the courtroom that's not complete
if it's not complete is not a full copy

407
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,899
or not a full image than they normally
won't allow it because it becomes kind

408
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,230
of like see here say you don't know what
the rest of the content is but I've seen

409
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,650
him do it and more more it's becoming
more and more common they're getting it

410
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:42,110
in there actually able to say that half
the picture was good enough and that

411
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,750
they're getting it accepted because
people think that you know they've

412
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:51,820
Washington CIS enough or something and
they know how this works that's yet all

413
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,710
the cybercrime staff and runs into a
room in three minutes later he comes out

414
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:02,280
you can tell you everything like know
how that works with the right words

415
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,660
highlighted or they zoom in on your
license so so there's a whole list of

416
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,560
reasons already gave you either using
these tools are continuing to do this

417
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,510
but they have no incentive whatsoever
they're hiding all this content so

418
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,350
they're continuing to use things like
this so didi would be a normal wonder

419
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,560
using this is a more advanced tools and
ed its open source again still it's

420
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,870
another Linux to remedy that it was
written by the Department of DOD

421
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:36,679
Department forensics forensics lab and
it has some abilities to at least deal

422
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,880
with a minor amount of some of the
errors it's still not extremely thorough

423
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,810
but this just shows that there's other
tools out there that actually have some

424
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,830
advanced features but only one

425
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,710
the forensics imagers that I looked at
you just a more advanced version used

426
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:55,220
this version which was the date of the
dinner was the only tool that use this

427
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,169
out of all different signatures let's
see are you

428
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:03,419
Labs is the one that makes that so there
is some advanced features

429
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:07,820
there's another open source tools out
there that's actually very advanced it's

430
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,230
a Linux derivative its DeeDee rescue CD
rescue is very common one that a lot of

431
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,440
people in data recovery are trying to do
things with you know just software no

432
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,760
hardware capabilities of things you're
missing without the hardware though

433
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,730
things like let's turn the power off and
turn it back on

434
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,690
let's keep track of where the sector was
that we just read and then continue on

435
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,659
from there and do a hard reset and
things like that which btw rescue can't

436
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:34,500
do myself you could probably triggered
you could probably do some things with

437
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,649
your machine to make that happen but
that's the closest thing from the

438
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:41,719
standpoint of the possibilities not a
single forensics immature that I found

439
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,870
used this one at all this has been
around for a long time to has been

440
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,959
around for a decade and not a single one
of them used in the more advanced

441
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,870
features they used to straight-up ed to
actually do their imaging processes if

442
00:31:54,870 --> 00:32:00,789
that tells you anything so so at least
from the standpoint the vendors don't

443
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:04,090
think that this is a broken problem made
mainly primarily because in the old days

444
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,860
the whole issue came up with imaging was
that the drugs were supposed to be good

445
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,110
to begin with

446
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,360
now I'm actually seeing any huge amount
of them with problems they just don't

447
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,740
want to spend the money why would they
spend the money on an engine that you

448
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,950
can see when they can make a pretty
interface that looks like Star Trek

449
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,850
that's really important to them so if
it's really pretty and looks like it

450
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,620
does a lot of good things in you know
unless somebody's testing them against

451
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,239
damage drives they don't know this and
when I talk to the vendors about the

452
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,990
things they don't even understand what
I'm talking about they actually have no

453
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,389
idea even the tax have no idea so here's
an example this is a tool called a deep

454
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:41,399
scar and this is a Windows they have a
Windows view of what happened to the dr

455
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:46,340
because the the actual device runs in da
house and it does quite a bit

456
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,730
its physical piece of hardware it is a
key piece of hardware but it runs in da

457
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,590
ass and can control device and do a lot
of things that you can't do otherwise at

458
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,918
all because there's no drivers it's
physically doing it and dog because it

459
00:32:58,919 --> 00:32:59,840
can talk directly to

460
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,070
hardware so all of those dark green
spots right here

461
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,559
those were all errors those are all ones
that had timeouts and errors Windows

462
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,770
couldn't see them

463
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,240
Windows Windows only read the sector up
to six hundred milliseconds if it has a

464
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,840
problem after six hundred milliseconds a
just fails and will say CRC or whatever

465
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,178
and just fail and open the file

466
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:23,620
well sometimes all you have to do is
increase the amount of time they are

467
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,279
going to take to read something and that
would be indicated by these green ones

468
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,490
where you're actually doing something
that would be a problem then you turn

469
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,029
around and read it

470
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:37,080
increase the time but you've also done
something called ignore ECC every drive

471
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,230
every time that there is a sector that
has an error there the drive is going to

472
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:45,520
return 0 but you can actually tell in
certain instances I would like that data

473
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,570
anyway no matter what it was and then
you can build your own array or try to

474
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,439
build your own software around it to say
what was the good guess what was the

475
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,809
date I got this data ninety-nine times
which ones were the same and you can

476
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:01,620
actually parts that out and do something
with it so there's no way any forensics

477
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:07,039
tool would have made it through a drive
like this so so anyway I'm trying to get

478
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,190
away from zero but I'm gonna show you in
reality this is what a sector looks like

479
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,339
a sector everybody's been told and maybe
people know and here I don't but a

480
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:23,659
sector is normally 512 bytes so every
single sector has a huge amount of

481
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:28,379
tracking data all of this other stuff is
all the tracking information that's

482
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,710
actually sitting there at a sector
there's your second right there you're

483
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,040
512 bytes so every time you try to read
this

484
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,949
there are specific types of errors so as
an example there's an address error and

485
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,428
it'll actually give you idea not found

486
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,220
there's another one where it cannot read
ECC and has to skip and quit and that

487
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:52,020
would be it's even see this is easy see
where the ECC actually fails and then

488
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,609
there's another one called address
market there's a whole slew of these

489
00:34:54,609 --> 00:35:00,810
there's a whole pile of these types of
issues with regards to content that

490
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:06,900
surround the 512 byte every single data
recovery tool that is hardware based at

491
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,040
least all reports every one of those
errors they will tell you exactly what

492
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,450
was

493
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,930
with the sector and where this problem
occurred guess how many forensics tools

494
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:22,810
20 at correct they don't report they
have no idea why there was an error

495
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:27,140
absolutely zero the Dr told them why it
was an error they just ignored it

496
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,140
through the way they didn't even bother
to try to figure it out they have

497
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,680
absolutely no idea not a single
forensics told us that would to me be

498
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,790
the definition of friend that if you're
sitting there testifying about something

499
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,970
in a court case don't you think that you
should be able to explain the details

500
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,848
surrounding what the problem is

501
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:48,750
data recovery guys can but forensics
guys can't who has the most money here

502
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,579
as a matter of fact friends guys have an
infinite amount of money by comparison

503
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:55,940
to the data recovery guys data recovery
goes by one tool and sit on it for

504
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,430
twenty years because they don't want to
spend any more money so they'll do

505
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,669
things the hard way to save a dime the
friendly skies are spending you know

506
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,349
anywhere between four in and $20,000 a
year on every single tool that they buy

507
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:11,530
but none of their tolls are advanced
none of them are doing this through the

508
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,480
whole list there's actually pages of
this content and I'm not going to keep

509
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,180
going through all that but we have a
bigger problem today if you had a drive

510
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:25,589
that previously existed that had a 512
bytes actor and something goes bad how

511
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:31,569
much data did you lose let's just say
you're 512 bytes actor goes bad you lose

512
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:37,450
512 bytes that's all you lose one single
sector anybody seen these drives you

513
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:43,930
guys know that these drugs are they've
been sold since 2010 2009 2010 you all

514
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,770
probably actually have them you probably
every drive just about today does this

515
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:52,759
when if you can't read what this says
this is called an Advanced Format Drive

516
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,180
to achieve full performance and Windows
XP you must use this WOD line software

517
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:03,879
in order to align a single partition
blah blah blah now the problem is they

518
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,280
put this label on a drive but they
didn't explain it anybody didn't explain

519
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,290
what the problem is or what occurs what
happened is they went 24 K sectors

520
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:17,589
natively on the drive so instead of
doing 512 byte it wanna keep tracking

521
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:22,990
that and they will do manufacture do
horrible things to the drives to make it

522
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,439
sound

523
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,600
really good from a marketing perspective
that will do horrible things for you but

524
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,319
it sounds really awesome when they tell
you oh yes porque drives are faster we

525
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,600
can read this data we can do a whole
bunch of things that we didn't do before

526
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:38,880
the problem here is partition alignment
because until Windows Vista we did not

527
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,660
have the ability to have a partition and
everywhere on a disk we had to put it on

528
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:49,350
one side of one platter always it was a
calculation now it's not reality anymore

529
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,120
it changed a number of years ago when we
went to what they'll be a blocks it's

530
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,980
not really in reality on the side of a
platter but the calculation is the same

531
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,240
on that side of the platter so there is
a calculation that says I'm going to

532
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,959
start a partition on one side and had to
do a speed of your drive when you look

533
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,500
at an old hard drive you would have a
stack of hedge that would be inside of

534
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,080
less for platters and you have a edge
and that whole stack will be moving

535
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,810
together why does the whole stack move
together anybody know what's happening

536
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:27,270
usually when I asked why why why with
all these had been moving together what

537
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:36,570
it what housing data being written you
have any idea was that so that's what

538
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:41,010
everybody says it hasn't been that way
in two decades and that's how every

539
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,310
class and everything today tells you
including Dec council including a number

540
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,750
of other ones that I've read they all
tell you that that's how the data is

541
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,830
being read that is being written down
through and written to read from a

542
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:57,410
cylinders perspective that is absolutely
not true it is not

543
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:02,080
yeah

544
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:15,000
how do what ya that's still primarily
there's two ways that happens as native

545
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,110
Command Queuing that's what you're
referring to things like the native

546
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:23,330
Command Queuing the caching process yet
so there's a caching process every most

547
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,870
drive today have cash they have physical
dear AM and when the head is ahead of

548
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,120
where you're reading and here's the
really cool thing it's only when it's

549
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,160
going forward it's not when it's going
backwards it caches the content into RAM

550
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,350
and then delivers it to you faster
because it already read the data it's

551
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,980
not waiting for you at this point
however and I'll prove it to you here in

552
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,990
a second what happened in the in the
mid-nineties IBM came up with this

553
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,490
method of writing data to drive based on
speed where is the fastest location on

554
00:39:52,490 --> 00:40:00,700
your hard drive outside outside edge of
the disc is faster not because it's been

555
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,089
factored it doesn't spin faster it's
because the head doesn't have to move to

556
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,340
read more data you have morse

557
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,980
sectors physically around the outside
edge of the ring then you do at the

558
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:16,200
center of the ring so therefore if it
stays there you have no head leafy you

559
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,939
have no issue moving your head or doing
anything so in order for you to read

560
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,110
data and you've all seen that picture
you've all seen the defrag Norton used

561
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,300
to throw up there and they would
actually show you a moving all the

562
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,810
sectors to the outside edge that was in
reality exactly what was happening

563
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:35,420
things are broken up into something
called zones and what you can think of

564
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:41,130
his own is as a little football field of
data it's a whole ring a cylinder where

565
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,850
the data is going to exist on the
platter I'll show you a picture here in

566
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:48,920
just a second so to finish this part
before show you that picture they're

567
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,780
using porque sectors this is what 512
used to look like so this is what 512

568
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,000
bytes look like in the whole picture I
showed you the whole bunch of other crap

569
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,010
in it had to do the sector well thats
all here they're just not including in

570
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,330
their picture because there are some
null space you have to get the head of

571
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,549
break when you're moving your sector
from one location to another so you're

572
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,880
giving it a break and that's what this
thing called the sector gap is is just a

573
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
babe

574
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,150
break in the sector down here where you
see these bites of known because the

575
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,950
head has to have a break it can't say hi
hi hi low

576
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,180
you have to have to get a break of a
chance in the middle so that it can

577
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,569
actually figure out there's a note new
sector coming so so that's what's

578
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,990
happening here now what they decide to
do is they decide to work this if we

579
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:39,689
just put it all into forecast and we can
get rid of all those no bites in between

580
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,320
so everything else is the same size
everything else has to be the same size

581
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,580
ECC the same by size everything's the
same thing to happen is they got rid of

582
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:53,490
all those Noles and they added about 11
percent of space to your disk however

583
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:59,779
when a second goes bad how much did he
lose so all those sectors if they were

584
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,400
reading them in forensics tools and any
one of them turned up bad it's now times

585
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,450
eight right so used to be 512 bytes and
that we had it was ira's now it stands

586
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:16,029
eighth that's a huge amount of space by
the time we're done with 12 times age i

587
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:20,550
mean those things can continue to grow
and so this is gonna be a continual huge

588
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,600
problem if they don't practice in
forensics every time they say I got a

589
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,740
bad sector it's not won best actor is a
better that's what you're looking at now

590
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,629
just pointing and all those other tools
read the content natively so every

591
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,560
single tool in forensics every one of
them no matter what even if it's a fork

592
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:44,150
a drive they read the sector's 512 at a
time so they will make that request

593
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:49,070
eight times for that sector whereas
forensics tools have a things called

594
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,640
long sector reads they will actually say
oh I have a fork a drive I only need to

595
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:01,049
read that one time that makes the the
imaging process eight times faster data

596
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,090
data recovery tools if they read them
natively it makes it a ton better know

597
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:10,030
forensics told today that its not one of
the two data recovery forensics tools

598
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:13,980
will read a min native aka don't know a
single one of them that will do it they

599
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,030
and several them tableau has a huge
problem with some of these and continual

600
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,860
upgrades and other things so it'll be
eight times faster so now anatoly

601
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,840
anatole imager which I don't know if any
of you know speeds or whatever else has

602
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,410
to do with it but normally when I said
you could do between 200 and 300 gigs in

603
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:36,799
our anatoly imagery can read up to 500
gigs and it is the fastest imager I've

604
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,360
ever seen so if there's no problem if
there's no problem at all I can copy 500

605
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,300
gigs an hour so I don't know of any
other tool that can even come close to

606
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,890
that from that standpoint so this is
what the atoll ur Tola insight

607
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:55,839
forensically major looks like it's a
little box that has has 3 target ports

608
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:01,530
on the side that has a source pore over
here we can also do painted drives has a

609
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:05,310
built-in write protection switch it has
all the same features that you would

610
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:09,710
have any other forensic stole from that
standpoint accepted it also can do

611
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:15,040
imogene recovery of those sectors at the
same time and a lot faster at that point

612
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,330
the smart disk imager is one of the
other tools it's it's really a card it

613
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,540
goes in your system and then you can use
Windows software and also offered to

614
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:31,600
talk to this particular device it has
input for all three the same standard

615
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,569
paid and then you can use converters for
everything else and it has a daughter

616
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:38,340
card that can go with it that you can
plug into you can do more drives at the

617
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:43,430
same time and both of these tools both
both the atoll and this one you know

618
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,299
those passport drives today anybody
opened those little Western Digital

619
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:53,480
passport bad what is in there was it
connected to how can you connect that to

620
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:04,410
your system that's why yes that but okay
so they used to have an actual say to

621
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,060
connector in there and then they use a
little bridge bored and they plugged in

622
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:12,160
but now they don't have won it all now
it's a sated USB bridge connector

623
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,600
built-in on the board and there is no
sada coming out anymore comes out USB so

624
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,660
in order to actually make it say that
again you have to break it there's a

625
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,290
break for capacitors yet the resource
for wires on and you have to connect to

626
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,850
say to connector so that you can read it
to do recovery because for those of you

627
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:34,250
who don't know USB sucks

628
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,300
it sucks you cannot use it for recovery

629
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,000
everybody I talk to when they first
start this process and they're thinking

630
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,420
about being in a recovery gonna come to
class the first thing that they're doing

631
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,450
is you're telling me these stories about
what we talked we put on any USB

632
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:53,529
enclosure we connected it to us and we
tried to recover data like you get off

633
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,480
eighty percent of your problem right
away if you just connected it to the

634
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,400
motherboard just don't connected to USB
you can solve a lot of problems

635
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,470
connecting it straight to your
motherboard because your motherboard has

636
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,419
a controller and you can get a better
controller by the way then that one that

637
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,750
will actually do better error correction
and you be able to recover sectors that

638
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:17,620
you couldn't recover otherwise so get
rid of USB now the problem with USB is

639
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:22,279
USB one and USB to they both have were
just dumb controllers nothing you can do

640
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,820
nothing special

641
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,100
they literally just make a request to go
to this nickel chip that you buy from

642
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:34,440
China or wherever whoever got the lowest
bid that week and you hope for the best

643
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,880
now usb3 is a different animal usb3 as a
lot more like an Ethernet protocol you

644
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,220
can make requests you can do certain
things

645
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,399
the problem is no tools understand how
to make the request in the forensics

646
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,670
world only in the data recovery world in
the data recovery world they can

647
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:56,500
actually talk to USB three drives
natively and treat them like standard

648
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:02,290
SATA controllers so both the DEP's bar
and the Attalla have a input directly

649
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:08,220
for brawl native USB three drives you
can do a recovery without breaking them

650
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,439
so you don't have to break for
capacitors and Reese are on a specific

651
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,120
connector now that's always been an
option so far that you could break it

652
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,700
and restore these connectors on and then
actually do a recovery anyway but at

653
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,930
least the stop you from having to you
know you can immediately plugged into

654
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,859
the system and start working on it but
if they can't read none of the forensics

655
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,390
tools can read at all

656
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:33,640
0 not a single one of them can do it so
these are the only tools this one this

657
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:39,210
one can read USB as well this is this is
the only american-made to all this talk

658
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,700
here all the top tools in the world

659
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,839
none of them are made in

660
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:48,450
after the only one that made here is the
CPR tools they this tool is from Ukraine

661
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:56,759
just call is from Ukraine this call is
from florida this tool is from Russia so

662
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,640
these three that are from foreign
entities believe it or not every

663
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,940
government agency that you work at been
to or seen as these three tools all from

664
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:12,400
Russia or the ukraine sometimes they
think it's a security risk sometimes

665
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,150
they don't there's all kinds of problems
buying them because the one in Russia

666
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:22,980
only accept Western Union transfer some
money to buy so they can't use credit

667
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,610
cards we got sanctions and all kinds of
things they can't buy anymore but I will

668
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:30,410
tell you this is the most powerful tool
in the world this tool is the most

669
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,970
mature it's been around the longest it's
called a PC three thousand it can do

670
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:38,680
firmware can talk two drives and if you
want to let's say you want to travel

671
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,140
with a hard drive and you don't want to
say to be able to catch you could

672
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:48,690
literally go into the firmware and turn
off an entire platter started off just

673
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:53,330
started off when you travel they all
they can never read it they can every

674
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:57,880
you get to where you're going to turn it
back on like that so I gotta do just

675
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,650
physically turn off turn off our main
funders you want so there's an option

676
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:06,310
for you to be able to see this going to
think anything that you want to do is

677
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:13,020
doable with this tool as a whole so and
just real quick the only the only least

678
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,410
from a standpoint of the only to Latin
America one of the awesome things about

679
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:21,390
this this is a forensics imagery it does
have a minor a bit of data recovery

680
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,819
built anna has some functions but it's
not available

681
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,000
the way that the toilet right now this
is the cool thing about this tool that's

682
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,820
very small quick and easy to set up you
can go and plug it in

683
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,370
get your drivers running and then you
plug into a USB connector into your

684
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:38,770
laptop and there's another piece of
software that will let you control the

685
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,170
imaging process so you can start the
imaging process and do it all from the

686
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,300
box but then if there's a problem where
you want to control it you can plug into

687
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:50,420
USB adapter that plugs into USB cable
into your laptop and use the software to

688
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,240
control it

689
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,910
including things like skipping sectors
and doing reverse and so this is the

690
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:55,960
only a toll

691
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,359
in any of those categories that even
close to what happens with these other

692
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:05,069
three tools in still be a forensics guy
and still be a forensic similar so they

693
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:09,849
don't technically called a friend
expenditure so there's a huge amount of

694
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:13,599
the problems that can be solved here but
I'm gonna show you some pictures rather

695
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:20,420
tell you all this crap on this list so
these tools at least the Attalla itself

696
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,390
does diagnostics on the drive it
actually will populate registers on

697
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:27,339
board and then read them back and try to
tell you what's wrong to drive in a run

698
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:32,540
through variation of a list of five
items and then break those down to try

699
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,440
to tell you oh you have one bad head you
could turn the head off and still read

700
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,300
all the other players on all the other
areas so no forensics tools do that

701
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,890
again you can literally say I have you
know you start driving and you can't

702
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:52,770
read it you can literally turn off one
head that might be bad and read all they

703
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:56,490
had all the other players on the drive
so you might not get a hundred percent

704
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:59,950
to drive you'll get seventy percent of
the driver eighty percent of the drive

705
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,649
and now people are thinking while the
data that was written down through the

706
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,690
cylinders well that's a problem that's
why I said if you break it up all the

707
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:10,650
stuff all the data is written in chunks
is called zones show you pictures owns

708
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,730
in a minute so you can read consecutive
day it'll be too big chunks or four get

709
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:20,390
drunk 488 chunks all at once on one side
of a platter without changing heads to

710
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:24,230
the other side of platter only one head
can be on or off at a time

711
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,050
the entire stack is just being dragged
along with it the rest of the stack is

712
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:33,040
doing nothing so if you have a heads in
a stack all the other heads except one

713
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,509
are doing nothing they're just being
dragged along so you're only reading or

714
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,650
writing from one had at one time

715
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:46,950
any point so does 2013 that these tools
also do one other thing if you look here

716
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,629
at the bottom of the screen while you're
imaging the drive it shows you the

717
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,930
sector's index as its reading them

718
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:58,710
it reads and writes them and shows you
in hex so you are not blind sometimes

719
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,810
what happens is ahead

720
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:04,430
timeout and it will just go 02 the end
of the drive that's the same thing here

721
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:08,410
in the totals well it'll show you every
single sector as its reading it in hex

722
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,710
so if there is an error and from here on
something screwed up and all you had was

723
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:16,940
eros you would see it is green you would
know while your image in it something is

724
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,550
wrong and you can still go back you
don't have to do this can concurrently

725
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:24,930
you can stop it and going image any part
of it anytime that you want so you can

726
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:29,649
start in a new spot and you can just
jump to a particular sector and images

727
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:35,990
at any point on that is not concurrent
told USB sucks USB the mass say this is

728
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:40,069
a bad head this is what it actually
looks like this is for heads so for

729
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:43,230
heads on the drive so there's one
section to section three sections and

730
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:49,390
there's the fourth one this data from 0
to 4096 so this is this is a chunk of

731
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:53,509
data is done on three different heads
that can be read turning off one head

732
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:57,100
it's all consecutive from that
standpoint it is not written down

733
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,799
through all the platters so you can
actually see that there's actually an

734
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,600
item in the list scolds own tables as
own table breaks this content down and

735
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,390
got a picture wasn't able coming up in
this list this is a list of things that

736
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:14,160
are written to europe latter's most
people think the board contains a lot of

737
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,450
intelligence about how your drive is
going to work and it's walking boards

738
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:22,210
will do a lot of tricks you're bored and
most contains for possible tables the

739
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:25,290
rest of it is already on the platters
your serial number your model number

740
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:29,750
those things are written on the platters
the platters has its own complete

741
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:34,750
operating system that the driving to the
function when it first starts up so this

742
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:38,210
is just a small list of those things too
bad block table there's actually two of

743
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:41,970
them has more than two of them actually
and then as a total before there's a lot

744
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,620
of timing issues this is what one of the
controllers' screens for what for the

745
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,900
deeper looks like and if you look at the
details I mean it can literally break

746
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:53,710
out every single thing there's a huge
thing here also that most people won't

747
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:58,970
understand but it's called LBA 28 bit
248 bit mode it's an obsolete command

748
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:04,419
that almost every drop still owls on any
sector below a hundred and thirty seven

749
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,020
gigs where you can read it more
accurately

750
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:12,720
there were but you have to put it into
LGA 28 bit mode we upgraded and 2002 or

751
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,200
so to LBA 48 bit mode and they got rid
of this command so a lot of times we can

752
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,509
go back and forth this command and at
least read the first hundred and thirty

753
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:24,010
seven games of the disc better than we
can read any of the other side but

754
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,180
there's a lot of little details like
this you never see these in Forensic Sci

755
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,240
majors and physics imagers you get a
little thermometer bar that goes across

756
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,169
and you get a button that says go and
that's it that's what you get

757
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:39,750
go so either dis examples of some of the
stuff you can do you can program it to

758
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,730
skip come back again basically do all
the good stuff and then come back and do

759
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:49,720
the bad stuff later so you can skip to
content and come back to it later and my

760
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,819
entire point here is if your wallet
caught on fire and you have $512 in it

761
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,550
and in your wallet

762
00:54:55,550 --> 00:55:01,500
you are able to recover $511 when you
keep that would you throw it away as

763
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,040
hell knows and while it was burned away
so that's effectively what's happening

764
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,410
in forensics they're throwing the
content away and getting rid of it and

765
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:14,990
personally I would keep it so these are
some of the situations where 4828 bit

766
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:20,569
help you can also imagine reverses have
already described and then physically

767
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:24,530
this particular tool and it might not
make much sense to people to see it here

768
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,120
on the screen

769
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:32,440
metadata inside your drive which one I
say meditative labs I mean in TFS as a

770
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,050
table and it's called MFT and that's the
master file table it literally is the

771
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:42,650
tree that you're looking at the tree
that you see in Windows is part of a

772
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:46,950
structure in the MFT it's a very small
amount of data comparatively so it might

773
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:51,109
be about 300 megs or so all it does is
tell you the layout of where the data is

774
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,230
on the drive

775
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:57,270
well these tools all of these tools all
the forensics tools don't do this at all

776
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:02,790
not a single one of them but all of the
data recovery tools do this you copy the

777
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:07,490
metadata that three hundred make time
file and it builds the tree for you we

778
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:12,609
don't have any data all we have is the
tree we check the box that we want and

779
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:18,299
we say image the selected area and it
will actually image just the section

780
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:23,519
of the drive that specific to that file
and it does it in order so it does it

781
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:26,808
logically from the beginning of the
block to the end of the blocks into

782
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:30,839
clusters in order without touching
anything else in the drive so the whole

783
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:35,359
premises don't touch any sectors on the
drive unless ur cloning them if you're

784
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,848
cloning them to a second drive then
you're protecting them you should only

785
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:42,009
ever have to touch them once you should
never touch them twice when you normally

786
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:46,779
build a tree and data recovery software
the software you were just download off

787
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:51,039
the internet that bill to treat it scans
your whole drive build a tree menu

788
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:52,869
select what you want and you recover it

789
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:58,529
you touched every sector twice at least
twice without copying it before you've

790
00:56:58,529 --> 00:57:03,189
exported the data that's a terrible
thing to do horrible things to do that

791
00:57:03,189 --> 00:57:07,779
would be bad news so so fundamentally
that was kind of the whole impression

792
00:57:07,779 --> 00:57:12,660
that I'm trying to get everybody as far
as the list of items I do have a picture

793
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:16,308
of his own table apparently is not in
those particular slide but I'm about to

794
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:22,880
run out of time and about but let me
show you a zone table just because it

795
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,449
was a question as a whole bunch of
things with Dr Zakir break chips off do

796
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:33,079
things and your job will still run
there's things that you can do some

797
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:38,319
flying through some slides this is own
table this tells you which head is

798
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,699
broken down now this is right off of the
drive I save this straight out of a

799
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:46,410
drive so if you look ahead 0 there's
three locations forehead 0 here at the

800
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:50,479
beginning of the drive it's theirs are
the locations and then your lbs so you

801
00:57:50,479 --> 00:57:55,769
have a start location at zero and is for
but you look for this is owned one two

802
00:57:55,769 --> 00:58:00,828
and three there in order so right here
that the first blocks of the drive those

803
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:05,650
are the first lbs that's six gigs of
data that's concur in consecutive on the

804
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:11,539
drive before it moved ahead to another
drive to another player so that

805
00:58:11,539 --> 00:58:16,349
physically will keep your data when you
have a step ladder that scratched your

806
00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:20,099
only have one of those that's going to
be damaged the rest of the data may

807
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:25,239
still be fine and it's completely
possible in your drive that amount of

808
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:28,420
data for them out there we've just
copied is all of the My Documents folder

809
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:32,509
unless it's somebody has pirated movies
or whatever but at least from that

810
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:36,439
standpoint the data will be there so and
this is what I was trying to point out

811
00:58:36,439 --> 00:58:40,629
what the cylinders basically all this
data only one side of the platter the

812
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:44,979
data's concurring you can actually deal
with six and eight and 10 depending upon

813
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:48,989
the breakdown of the table so it's gonna
be on one side one platter for their

814
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:53,189
zones right that's it

815
00:58:53,189 --> 00:59:10,740
yes sir

816
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:16,419
yeah

817
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:23,610
yeah so single technology did was think
of it like blu-ray blu-ray basically

818
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:27,440
uses a more intense beam to read down
further into the disc and you have

819
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,890
layers multiple layers that's
essentially what they've done with

820
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:35,240
shingled is basically they've stack the
sectors in a way that then they will

821
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:40,109
read them according to their strengths
and their pretty volatile in my opinion

822
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:43,160
I see a lot of cash drawers and see a
lot of them that are terrible and just

823
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,210
one reason why they're also probably
focusing only on the release currently

824
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:51,000
on the enterprise market is because
somebody gets pissed off its probably

825
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,160
client has a lot of money and they're
ready or throwing back up there how much

826
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,879
things going on rather than the home
user who is gonna have a disaster but

827
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,550
since 2006 we've at least change the
technology prior to 2006 the technology

828
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:08,310
was almost exactly the same for fifty
years from a standpoint of how he wrote

829
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:12,640
data since 2006 we went to perpendicular
encoding now it gets tangled and then

830
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,330
we've got a new type of technology
that's coming out that's called hammer

831
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:20,370
which is he assisted magnetic recording
so that has a little tiny laser mean in

832
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:21,790
front of your head

833
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:27,390
heats up the platter because if it's hot
it actually can change its phase quicker

834
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,660
and easier to get a smaller amount of
space

835
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,430
the problem is is it saps news
lubrication in the lubrication

836
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:36,879
evaporates so they have this little
container of lubrication that they say

837
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,040
for the lifetime of your drive that they
will automatically periodically spray

838
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:47,220
your platter and reliever case I'm not
kidding that you have a lifetime

839
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:52,450
container of lubrication yet the only
player and it does it on a particular

840
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:58,529
schedule so but yes those that's why
those are in those higher end but I

841
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:04,840
personally would say I wouldn't be using
any of those in obviously you're

842
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,070
probably using them in RAID arrays and
things like that but just understand

843
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:15,370
raid 6 I hope at least not raid 5 better
at least from the standpoint of having

844
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:18,140
duplicates but still

845
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:21,920
just keep in mind those things go they
go fast and a lot of them go a lot of

846
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,549
times they have the same bugs and saying
things will happen all in order

847
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:28,400
don't use solid state drive SATA RAID
array I know I know people think that's

848
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,380
really cool thing is really fast and
whatever else happens but trust me when

849
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:35,730
I tell you they have the exact same life
span so every time one of those drives

850
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:39,829
dies another one's about to go because
they have the exact same sector lifespan

851
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:43,730
so rate as opposed to be so that you
have one to survive during the process

852
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:47,539
of another one being rebuilt well that
doesn't happen if they are all going to

853
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:50,579
die in the same time and the other thing
that happens is they all have the same

854
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:54,549
bugs so whatever bug kicks off one of
them kicks off all of them so all of

855
01:01:54,549 --> 01:02:01,420
them will die in the same breath so
don't use them just telling you yes sir

856
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:15,000
yes sir what does it reads now see it is
a weird thing it actually gets aboard

857
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,400
commands so it actually will give an
error everytime so your forensic

858
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,480
software win even right here is it was a
aboard for every single one and we just

859
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,220
died when do it but go ahead with your
question

860
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:34,200
well you're not supposed to read any
sector at all it's actually supposed to

861
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,230
give you an error for every single one
but there's a setting that actually says

862
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:42,329
we have a password set and my argument
is they should / every one of these data

863
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:46,349
recovery tools does it they flash a box
it says your password to say none of the

864
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:54,890
forensics tools do so anybody else you
guys can always find me and ask me

865
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:57,900
questions so or a headteacher class as
well
