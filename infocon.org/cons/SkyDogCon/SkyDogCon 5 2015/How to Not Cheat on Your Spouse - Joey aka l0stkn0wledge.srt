1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,150

2
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:28,418
holder what could possibly go sorry

3
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:33,699

on a CTF so great alright so for those
you came as how to not cheat on your

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,330
spouse would ask Madison can teach you
about upset to give you a little bit of

6
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:48,230
overview as having conversation not long
after the jump came out and everybody

7
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,529
was kind of trawling through it looking
for their neighbors and their friends

8
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:57,330
and everyone else one of my friends were
like well you know this seems like a lot

9
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:03,610
of people just completely failed at you
know and managing their identity in mind

10
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,619
because you're going to you and your
spouse the person you're gonna cheat

11
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,200
with really need to know anything about
you what kind of led to this talk and

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,009
led to be looking to the data to figure
out who kinda sorta got it right when

13
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:24,820
they decided to go cheat on their
significant other so little bit about me

14
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:37,220
handle Twitter profile picture giant
nerd Star Wars Legos yes who doesn't

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,980
love Legos part of a group of hackers
even after having just moved out from

16
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,409
from that area

17
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:54,870
know a lot of the guys I've from there
so so couple years ago I actually had

18
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,830
somebody at a former employer asked me
for a disclaimer scenarios include

19
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,940
disclaimers on my talks because
apparently people might know who it work

20
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,880
for so as always all views and opinions
contained within this presentation are

21
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,700
my own they do not represent the beliefs
or opinions of my employer any other

22
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:19,238
affiliated organizations thinks that's
where slaves who comes in another

23
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,840
disclaimer in this one particular so
overmatched percent here in this

24
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,400
presentation for informational purposes
only and do not advocate that you

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,200
perform any illegal activities or cheat
on your significant other

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,569
furthermore do not claim that the
following that these any method to

27
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,599
discuss your own sure you stay out of
trouble though it'll probably make its

28
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:43,049
slightly more likely you will so in case
you were living under a cave for the

29
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,640
last you know six months or so little
bit of background and what up sucka is

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,059
yeah what's Ashley Madison Rayne

31
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:10,099
so for people who don't know what the
term yeah get on the couch it sorry so

32
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:15,929
sure proper security comes from military
terminology but you know the components

33
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,950
of our situation awareness you know in
this case in particular time but

34
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,040
situation awareness protecting your
identity protecting your information you

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,560
know you want to ensure that what you're
going to do isn't going to get you in

36
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,980
trouble isn't going to get you caught
kissing you know in the military sense

37
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,970
more its using more about making sure
people don't get killed in this case is

38
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,829
more likely keeping you from getting
divorced or or getting getting killed is

39
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:46,660
also quite possible so Ashley Madison
those who don't know was a alternative

40
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,290
dating site will call it there one of
their many mottos was life is short have

41
00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:01,980
an affair so they got this reputation as
you know being these sites to go to for

42
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,410
you know she doing your significant
other you know there's many adult dating

43
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,230
sites out there but this one in
particular team seemed to go for that

44
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,548
one angle there are others that also
take that angle there's been there are

45
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:23,349
lots of reports of scams you know fake
accounts and so a result the few months

46
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:29,420
ago they got hacked recordings of the
impact team

47
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,760
so there's a lot of ifs and what ifs and
I don't know at this point that

48
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:41,130
anybody's actually identified who the
hell they are so you know it could be it

49
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,370
could be anybody but I'm not going to
play the clue attribution version it's

50
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,170
just not worth it

51
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:54,820
just a few other notes wanna go over a
lot of people did try to go through and

52
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,150
identify users and so it's obviously a
very hard thing to do to to look at that

53
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,989
and say oh I know that you know this
person here was on the website because

54
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,410
you know we register through email
address

55
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,350
well Ashley Madison 20 validation of
email addresses so there's a lot of

56
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,420
people on there who registered to
publish our taxi registered and you know

57
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,280
I peter is obviously poor indicators the
biggest exposures to people who are on

58
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,830
this list of the people who were doing
credit purchases just because there was

59
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,719
far more information for those people
that anybody else I will say I have not

60
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:45,440
identified openly any actual users of of
the of the Ashley madison's I'm not into

61
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,590
the public shaming and I was more
interested in the stats then looking at

62
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,200
the end of the book data so you know so
when looking around what political

63
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:02,530
cartoons had to do that for some reason
I wonder why some public shaming there's

64
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,859
also a lot of public shaming pictures on
the internet I learned so I have time on

65
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,200
the internet and I find I find things I
like this one was such a thoughtful

66
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,180
working

67
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:28,500
so the lesson is the big accounts so I
went through the list and using the IP's

68
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,490
is one of the prime indicators there's
no great and it's not always perfect but

69
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:43,430
there were sixty five thousand accounts
that to another kind of similar site in

70
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,400
your city

71
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,609
VIP was registered was the concert with
them as another thirty thousand plus

72
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,039
from GA dating which we do some googling
very sketchy in skimpy things that that

73
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:10,699
they've done a lot of IP's reporting
back to 127 001 so you know how easy

74
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:16,199
they were doing a great job of a very
happy and then there was two hundred

75
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:23,320
twenty thousand that accounts that had
ideas that I back to you and Ashley

76
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:34,080
Madison IP address

77
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:56,099
so very the variance across the
different profiles a lot of it was

78
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,030
optional you basically get by by giving
any amount and kind of just filling out

79
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,349
what you wanted they didn't have like oh
you need to provide us every last little

80
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,979
bit of information about your life but
one of things they were apparently

81
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:09,539
captured with your IP address when
you're doing registration those not

82
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:17,159
consistent it's not their fault accounts
so that was one of the indicators and in

83
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,509
this case looking for the fake accounts
that I used i didnt digging through the

84
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,620
emails is particularly hard because not
only do you find lots of potential

85
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,039
legitimate ones but if you do a search
for ya wanna find everybody who

86
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,838
registered with Gmail was gonna be a
couple million responses back right

87
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,260
jet I mean you can kind of do a cursory
look through and see a lot of like yours

88
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,750
jabar's letters I just painted my
keyboard input @ gmail.com and it's

89
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,470
actually kind of talk about later sites
too because they were doing in a

90
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:54,149
validation trying to raise my rate try
to find out who's using it was kind of a

91
00:08:54,149 --> 00:09:02,990
little bit you know silly but it's also
kind of fun for people right

92
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:14,570
so I looked at the dogs are they
strictly Ashley Madison accounts was a

93
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,010
dump strictly Ashley Madison it appears
to be I don't know without looking at

94
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:26,010
the original source right off because
basically they're all there are street

95
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,810
dogs like you could turn this background
and show them back into an SQL database

96
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,260
clarifies removes not familiar the
overarching company that owns Ashley

97
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:43,920
Madison and yeah no I mean going be
stuff sold off the file names in the

98
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,560
information was provided it appears to
strictly be actually medicine accounts

99
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,250
but there could be other stuff thrown in
thrown in the database structure to

100
00:09:52,250 --> 00:10:06,600
operation security for us I can have a
dignified for plans you no real plan for

101
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,510
protecting your dick sure protecting
your ad in The creating a plan for

102
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,420
burning your identity

103
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,800
acquiring materials for plan execution
and execute your plan as I was in less

104
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,890
time and profit might be in there
somewhere to celebrate as to any to burn

105
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,730
plan as with a lot of this a lot of a
gypsy decide when you when you're going

106
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,300
to go through this is risk assessment
area if you're cheating on your spouse

107
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,219
and you're trying to figure out well I
don't want to get caught

108
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,170
how much paranoid you don't have that
your spouse's gonna be able to figure

109
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,520
out what you did right and that's using
this is the prime example it's do you

110
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:52,020
know if you're dating somebody who does
digital forensics and you know like

111
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,770
testifies in court cases and stuff like
that knows what they're doing probably

112
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,329
gonna want to be more paranoid than say
a few words you know somebody who

113
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:05,149
who was it was a nurse or something like
that who may not have as much 10 call

114
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:09,089
background may not know as much about
computers and as much about tracking

115
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:15,239
what you were doing online right so but
you definitely want to have your address

116
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:21,389
sitting in the Ashley Madison dump that
any push through and in fact a a lot of

117
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:27,189
people made it a lot easier when we were
living in Northern Virginia there was a

118
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:31,699
local kind of message board the people
used in the area where somebody

119
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:36,609
basically had gone to the credit dumps
and sorted and put the different bits

120
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,649
and pieces from based on areas like I
want to see the people who were in

121
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,660
Fairfax Virginia who were on this list
it took that credit DOM and just spit

122
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,079
that list out into the message board and
they did the same thing for you know the

123
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,579
other major cities in the Dec metro area
so they were they took all this

124
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:58,599
information and dumped towns and that
was enough for anybody you know have a

125
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,559
brain to go over well as this list of
all these people I can just go let's go

126
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,860
see it pops on it so trying to troll
through this information and its role

127
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,769
dumb form the credit transactions are
pretty easy to look because they're all

128
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:17,769
just comma-separated files so you can
kind of go through and and read through

129
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:22,139
that but to look through the profile
information like I said it's a it's just

130
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,279
equal done so without thrown back into a
database its he has to go through the

131
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:34,809
pain to go through and that's gigs and
gigs and gigs of data so people making

132
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:43,660
it slightly more accessible for others
kind of means that you know if you

133
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,559
decide to this is having physical
reactions to things right so you doing

134
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:54,079
anything whether this is judy and her
spouse we're going to go do some

135
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,390
borderline illegal or

136
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:00,240
or if you're gonna do you security
researchers a good example that doesn't

137
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,080
sound quite his legal legally bad you're
going to do some security research in

138
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:11,920
Europe you have a concern that you
researcher gonna do you are perceived or

139
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,380
that people might might not respect you
when you responsibly disclosed whatever

140
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,890
problems they're having a physical
connection to something that they can go

141
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,470
back and say oh he's found this person
when they were on R you know attacking

142
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,540
we were able to go back and see where
somebody would come in and tried to

143
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,630
attack our system are treasured tagger
service and guess what they did it from

144
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,350
their home I P you're gonna get gonna
have problems so it goes back to who

145
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:51,450
cares if you who cares if I get caught
so you know you your ISP's you know they

146
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,370
might care you know if they're actually
even looking to see what's going what's

147
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,630
the special stuff it may or may not be
going on in their networks

148
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,670
the companies whose research are you
researching against you may be attacking

149
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:09,530
or trying to determine if their stuff is
secure and working something if it's

150
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:18,319
something really legal the FBI your
state police your local police and if

151
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,090
you just trying to cheat you your spouse
with a frying pan so apparently this was

152
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:29,560
a stock image on the internet I predated
actually madison's of somebody that was

153
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,369
a thing

154
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:47,820
so just a couple just want to discuss
two classic kind of failures become

155
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:54,300
infamous if you're going to do stupid
shit you're gonna have people presume

156
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,380
put pictures of your girlfriends tits
and ass on the internet and expect that

157
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:06,020
to get caught so in this case for
anybody who didn't doesn't remember so

158
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:14,250
warmer in the cabin crew guys were done
in Australia think it was summer on the

159
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,110
other side of the planet but one of the
things I want to be getting him caught

160
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,370
was they put the EXIF data out when he
was doing these days doing the taunting

161
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,540
of figured out what kind of phone he was
using and you know using that

162
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,319
information and some other bits and
pieces from the internet was able to get

163
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:39,220
with hollywood's and even so if you're
going to taunt love of god don't put

164
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,670
pictures with accepted now granted this
wouldn't happen as much now because

165
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:49,589
twitter described except when it gets
posted so what you're saying is

166
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:55,160
literally he posted images wrong with
access data on the internet so they

167
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,150
don't have geo

168
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:01,819
July but it's like oh this is taking
with this iPhone

169
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,970
volleyball whatever had enough
information they were able to use that

170
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:12,690
when they caught him to tie back to him
and make him look ridiculous so the

171
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:20,560
other example yes everybody only yes I
don't know you saw the other one whether

172
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,500
or not you believe they actually caught
the real guy as I like to put it either

173
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:33,560
he's the biggest patsy in Indian history
of mankind or some of the worst toxic in

174
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,790
the history of mankind when some of them
and that was one of used against him in

175
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,969
trial included the fact it he used his
real image on fake IDs that they

176
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:51,200
intercepted on their way to him if
you're using fake IDs to purchase it to

177
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,450
the internet you don't have to put your
picture on it that I purchase I've

178
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:02,560
purchased demeans the underperforming
required to provide an IID didn't have

179
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,800
to provide any visual proof that I was
the person whose picture was on the idea

180
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,480
is to provide an idea that matched
whatever card information not for

181
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:18,530
nothing but to do that what type of idea
did you provide so in that case the

182
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:26,550
company that wanted it the company that
was questioning it requested but I think

183
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,990
that was there are other cases where
they'll provide the whole take other

184
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:40,730
ideas but using they want something that
is is they consider official so they

185
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,570
want to see something that was issued by
a government agency that they conclude

186
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,179
this looks real and if somebody went
into feet did they did a lot more work

187
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,450
than you know see you right to do with
our bags printers and printing

188
00:17:52,450 --> 00:18:07,220
somebody's in a fake work bad or
something

189
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:13,200
legitimate when I didn't so I have never
use I would like i would like to say I

190
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:27,059
have never used a fake IDs so so you
know the reality is that it if you're

191
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,260
for most stuff that you're gonna do an
internet odds are you're not going to

192
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,370
need a ninety lot of people there's
trust me very sketchy thing you want to

193
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,729
do there is a sketchy service provider
who doesn't want to check it there's a

194
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:49,429
whole list of IP use and whose providers
that are blocked by spam house another

195
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:55,870
plaque listing sites solely because they
know people just register them for spam

196
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:03,479
you know and for other illicit purposes
so they get blocked because there is a

197
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,820
basis we don't give a shit what people
are doing we were just a provider of the

198
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,250
service we don't have to have we don't
have any legal responsibility for what

199
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,299
they do if somebody comes in the plains
and he liked ok and will slow roll

200
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:20,710
ourselves and taking them offline but
the reality is that funny sketches then

201
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:28,230
you went to your bill to find somebody
do it was using identities online using

202
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,830
so using the same user names across
basis

203
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,610
Google search you know for any handle
you ever used it will take you five

204
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:47,520
seconds to find words been used multiple
places so much of a really common just

205
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,520
registering counts and you know the
people and the other thing so nothing

206
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,900
it's like crazy and I think this is one
of those ones where this goes back to

207
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,580
the house parent so things may have to
do is traced back his tears by the VPN

208
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,290
connections that were being used and
they trace them back to

209
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,490
hot spots near a friends house that he
was staying at our supposedly staying

210
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:21,420
close to this idea of you know people
you know if your gonna do that you're

211
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,170
going to be that lazy about it and maybe
you should find you know hot spot that's

212
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:42,190
not next door to your house just a
thought the first visit i dnt kno in in

213
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:49,770
in our interactions year were identified
by our names are appearances you know we

214
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,410
go and when you go to a store and buy
anything that method of payment if

215
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:59,980
you're using credit cards that's you
know he's a trackball information the

216
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,740
equipment that we use so any work or
anything that we do you have if you're

217
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,410
doing is in with your laptop are you
doing anything with your cell phone

218
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,420
right that that device there are ways
for that to be tied back to whatever

219
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:19,310
work whatever what you were doing so
great is that it's hard to protect an

220
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,490
altar a goal to your parents you need a
lot of money and a really good plastic

221
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:31,460
surgeon or really good makeup artist and
so this goes back to the the whole idea

222
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,850
the concept of the fake IDs rate that's
something that

223
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,350
gallery on that goes through the roof
because now if you're like oh well got

224
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,629
big ideas so that it's easier for you go
to my spouse will now you just gone from

225
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:52,260
I get busted by the frying pan to get
busted by local police or you know

226
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,830
federal government because I'm thinking
I am making fake IDs

227
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:07,570
so online so again you're handles that
you use your personas your email

228
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:14,850
addresses the IP's at your access from
the difference of your identity online

229
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,100
versus your physical identity as it's
much easier to alter this information

230
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:29,850
it's much easier to add these methods to
make yourself anonymous and to avoid the

231
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,019
same sort of pitfalls that you would
have an invisible right so whether

232
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:42,519
that's using tour ends using different
equipment which kind of a cross between

233
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:51,399
the physical and the online happens in
taking any information so that you know

234
00:22:51,399 --> 00:23:04,799
are also going to point in the DEFCON
coin thing of the company coming fucking

235
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,429
crypto currencies are this point does
anybody know like I i looked the other

236
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,350
day and I was like holy crap and
everybody in the mother decided they

237
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:28,799
needed a crypto currencies currency
exchange this point so it's in the

238
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,970
middle

239
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,059
it's in the middle class like
everything's good everything's good here

240
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:41,700
is what I got for protecting your so I
was the first thing in the morning

241
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,269
cross-contamination right so if you're
going to do stuff of mine says goes back

242
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:49,039
to the trip are robertson's instance
which is if you're going to have a

243
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,639
handle that you're using that use on a
forum as everybody knows that you're and

244
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:59,330
Tori so as I mentioned this to handle
lost knowledge not gonna go register a

245
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:04,730
hundred things and then go on to the you
know gone to the you know tour and

246
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:13,940
insert going to you know they're going
yeah whatever whatever whatever your

247
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:20,460
place so good with you know the version
5.0 and use that same handle larry and I

248
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,620
can use 1 I've used anywhere else like I
know what handles have used all mine

249
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,689
last twenty-plus years it wouldn't I
wouldn't go around creating one that's

250
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:36,850
like it I wouldn't create one that
sounds similar to it so it's one of

251
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:42,459
those things rate of protecting
predicting that dandy and then when it

252
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:48,880
comes to physically again it's it's a
hard thing to do but if you're doing

253
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,809
stuff stuff right where ok well im gonna
be if you're at the paranoia level words

254
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:58,330
like wall I need to go to this I'm gonna
go to this white house has wifi spot

255
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:04,908
which Starbucks connect or and use VPN
and taking all these measures will now

256
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:08,760
somebody if they tie back to that
Starbucks in like what did you know and

257
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,389
cops show up and they're like here
wondering about this first in this

258
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:17,889
together was really strange looking guy
who's here yet for like everyday for

259
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:22,270
like two months it was the same spot he
was just sitting there staring at a

260
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:31,240
computer right in society of blending in
an outlook not being obvious so from the

261
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,879
protecting it from the physical
perspective on things if you have some

262
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:41,629
identifying that you can easily hide say
like a tattoo that says my name is bob

263
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:47,809
or you know heart Stephanie forever or
whatever right maybe this weekend tattoo

264
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:53,700
like the troll face on your back I don't
care but the point is if you have

265
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,210
something like that it's easy to
identify when people remember and

266
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,549
recognize you're more likely to have a
situation where somebody's going to be

267
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:05,070
able to tighten up back to you
physically people are very forgettable

268
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,539
there been a lot of studies where
they've shown that we the people make

269
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:11,010
horrible eye witnesses to crimes because

270
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:18,580
we don't we don't remember we don't
really remember that I had like brown

271
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,330
here and he may have been like five feet
or maybe it was six feet tall and you

272
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,260
know prime example of people as a whole
were that is like shorter than me and

273
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,180
they're like what I do know a lot of
people like I'm sorry that's for me that

274
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,830
scope is right it's hard to tell you
know oh yeah there was a person who was

275
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:45,040
I don't know you're like 5256 I you know
somewhere in here like he was just all I

276
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,850
think you know our I had to look at the
top of his head he looked to be either I

277
00:26:50,850 --> 00:27:08,659
and I was amazed I looked up at him I
mean yeah so so so so when you make

278
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:14,160
acquisitions so obviously you don't get
anything in this world we must always do

279
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,320
with money there are still people who
support do things to barter trade but

280
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,659
money is the prime factor for getting
anything right

281
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,780
no-brainers not to use credit cards and
real-world situations it's casual the

282
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:35,110
time you're almost never gonna find a
place that won't take cash so if you

283
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:41,350
need to buy a computer can you to buy
you know if you need to buy a prepaid

284
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:48,850
phone or prepaid mobile hotspot those
things are easy to acquire cash in cases

285
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:53,899
where you do have to use credit cards
gift cards are the greatest thing you

286
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,050
can buy them with cash most puzzle take
them just the same as any other credit

287
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,310
card because their mind they're backed
by views of the back room master

288
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:06,600
quarterback by american express you know
they're the cash has already been laid

289
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,990
down their gonna take it they know their
transactions your little more limited

290
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,540
than somebody cash the computer screen
but that's where the two currencies like

291
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,480
Bitcoin come in and again the gift

292
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,690
cards gift cards are fairly universal
more times than not they will accept

293
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:33,970
them and the other important thing is
especially if using of kurds nothing's

294
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:41,530
ever going to validate the name you
might have to give an address

295
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,020
validate against an address but since
the kurds not registered to natural

296
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,820
person or two natural dress that's worth
finding things were just like oh this

297
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,879
Walmart in topeka kansas and that's
where my register more times than other

298
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,080
gonna do is validate the address is an
actual physical address somewhere if

299
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,949
they even do that and they may not be
just about money and the people are

300
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,210
stupid

301
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,400
there were over 9.3 million credit
transactions performed the only

302
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,060
information have his last four be cards
and the dump so developing the cards

303
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:25,040
being versus being actual credit cards
is not possible in all cases third

304
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:31,520
defendant I say definitively about
200,000 gift cards where people actually

305
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,540
put in they paid for the gift card a
gift card recipient or a gift for you

306
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,740
actually read the stupid like embossed
lettering on the gift card to put that

307
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:51,420
ended in bob jones which is fine staying
anonymous a little little too literal so

308
00:29:51,420 --> 00:30:01,870
using gift cards and kind of doing it
right they were still using there are

309
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:07,129
some who are still using real physical
addresses that tied to some generic spot

310
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,010
that doesn't mean it was a certainly
there's I can't validate that because I

311
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:14,080
don't know their name I don't know where
they were but the reality is they were

312
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,899
still using they were you doing putting
your version and build or how or if it

313
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,530
was just time they had registered as it
whenever they registered they didn't

314
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:31,180
create some obviously fake email address
for it and then a lot of a lot of them

315
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,370
or a lot of the IP sourced or porting as
IP block IDs so people are still just

316
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:41,679
connecting from there from their home
computers doing the purchases that way

317
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:49,010
you know some of them get it right at
least 120 the credit card bills and so

318
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,200
right thats I guess so again this goes
to the paranoia factor in a level of

319
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,550
these people assume that their data is
safe that she medicine and that you know

320
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:00,220
nobody's ever gonna dump the information
I don't need to worry about my email

321
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:15,840
address being in there gonna look for is
the credit card receipt so don't use

322
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,590
equipment computers are cheap really
really really cheap and used ones are

323
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:30,320
even cheaper prepaid wireless again if
you don't want to go use free hot spots

324
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:39,610
everywhere everybody rise into t-mobile
to AT&T has the street old wireless they

325
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:47,810
all have IDs they all have the mobile
hotspots get prepaid cash for them by

326
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,550
the charging cards for them

327
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:54,919
cash for those and so you can pay cash
for their internet access and the other

328
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,570
kind of nice thing if you haven't looked
is as we've been running out of ipv4

329
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:08,550
space all those eyes peas are netting
your public IP address so it's not all I

330
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:14,169
got this this router and I know it was
within five feet of here I know you know

331
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:23,830
you know you know what you might wind up
with his Verizon Verizon Hotspot ok well

332
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:32,809
we know the IP VIP we give you and they
usually not with 10 . network and

333
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:40,418
you know it locates roughly 20 so
wherever they're taking all those into

334
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:45,320
and you know obviously in various
married area it's not going to be like

335
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,340
the IP geolocation is going to be
precise as precise as it probably was

336
00:32:51,340 --> 00:33:00,100
there not gonna have you know there's
not going to be the IP block where that

337
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,209
provider has a sign people up for
scenario because they're always going to

338
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,490
be adding now and again from the money
money lessons cash cash or cash that's

339
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:15,119
just the way to go

340
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,949
messages about equipment under this one
looks incomplete but really it's not the

341
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,009
biggest thing it taught us that there
were a lot of people who like to use

342
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:29,009
their Blackberries and registered from
libraries there was a large chunk of

343
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:34,490
IP's I think I have another side to
mention this to large black eye peas

344
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:42,399
where registration came from blocks that
are held by blackberry twenty

345
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,570
thousand-plus accounts and that was
about me going through every last one

346
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:54,090
those are just the ones that were on the
high end of the IP's use your husband

347
00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:05,029
traveled a lot and had a blackberry so
what are you shopping options well

348
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:11,300
anywhere taking cash is always good
retail stores plenty if you're on a

349
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:19,520
budget there's lots of places sometimes
you'll find Suffolk markets craigslist

350
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:28,929
is probably slightly slightly more
difficult just because you already have

351
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:34,800
to have some sort of online presence to
be able to pull it off craigslist does

352
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,220
try to keep your email

353
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:40,888
private between you and the person
you're contacting with so even if you an

354
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,730
email that you use once and never use
again

355
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,179
just for the transaction that's more
shopping options once you've kind of got

356
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:52,109
an online persona and you're using it
for specific thing Amazon and wal-mart

357
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:54,980
have moved on this thing where you don't
even have to ship it to your house

358
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:05,200
anymore so you wanna make orders I don't
know that they were in every 7 11 back

359
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:15,839
in Northern Virginia damn near every 7
11 and there's a lot more elsewhere and

360
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,480
again if you've gone to that building
the online persona getting something

361
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:32,700
shipped in st. there you know it doesn't
matter nobody's validating that again if

362
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:46,180
you're using those used walkers on the
other side of its index online I've

363
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,759
never have never used one personally the
amazon offers I've seen in almost every

364
00:35:50,760 --> 00:36:08,500
the Walmart ones I've seen everywhere I
mean marks a really large duffel bag

365
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:21,180
is it like so it really depends rate so
like I know and you can see kind of in

366
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,069
the storage here there's like to like
half height lockers down there so I mean

367
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:33,940
there is some level or size restriction
rightly you're not gonna get your not

368
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:43,790
gonna get one of those but but but again
so there is some sizes dictionary but if

369
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:49,590
you're ordering anything like additional
computers or equipment or stuff to

370
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:56,340
upgrade your computer right that's all
gonna fit boxes of small so basically

371
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,120
the way they work is you make the order
and then they both have touch screens in

372
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,660
the middle of them in a sense you show
up and you say oh I'm here to pick up

373
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,990
order acts provide the order information
I believe they want to be there giving

374
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,500
you think it's just straight-up order
miss you take whatever I can you look at

375
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,240
my order it's supposed to be under you
know Bob Johnson R you know here's the

376
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,779
card I use of use the gift card swipe
the gift card just read the numbers

377
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,940
often find that order that matches that
so many ways I think it works pretty

378
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:30,730
similar to how the online ticketing
systems work when you purchase your

379
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:41,850
tickets you buy you show up at the kiosk
you swipe your credit card so

380
00:37:41,850 --> 00:38:15,900
definitely up there's there's cameras
everywhere and there's gonna be there in

381
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,900
these tended usually be near the
customer service center or people

382
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,290
already gonna be going to do normal
online order pickups the Amazon lockers

383
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,370
I think it really depends there is I
believe a camera that's actually in the

384
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:35,700
console where you're going to do pick up
and put the information in but it's

385
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,799
somebody watching as I is an actual
camera watching the lockers somebody was

386
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,180
able to open a locker without going
through that process that probably

387
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,080
depends on the facility because unlike
the Walmart version which Walmart

388
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,430
controls and store the control where
they're located the Amazon lockers are

389
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,740
going into other facilities rate so
there's no guarantee that whatever

390
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:05,250
convenience store or other has a camera
this point I'm sure Amazon once there

391
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,990
that doesn't mean there is

392
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:16,270
aw there's one and you can kind of see a
picture in the center of the Amazon one

393
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:22,330
there's a little black circle above the
control panel so if you're really tall

394
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:29,640
and just having a funny t-shirt for them
to read write or that state right at

395
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,390
somebody else could pick it up it's in a
seven-eleven go find the guy who's

396
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,759
sitting outside who wants money twenty
bucks going and get this thing on the

397
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,180
machine bring it back to me right people
do a lot of things for you for money

398
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:52,020
some legal in some any legal by the way
yeah but again so I point to make the

399
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,930
Raiders anything that you purchase in
this method anything you get this way

400
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,230
that was tied to something that you
bought if you're going if you're at that

401
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:03,050
high-level paranoia then it's it's not
then remember that whenever you get rid

402
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:08,180
of whatever you acquired died in with
you get rid of whatever it is you too

403
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,779
because the second that you think that
something happened in that somebody

404
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,050
might know that you know you're using
this computer wolf you bought something

405
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:16,910
else

406
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:20,890
another computer from it from there
there's potential somebody could figure

407
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:27,600
that chain out and say that few more
times I'm sure you're getting online

408
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,350
internet it's really free or really
cheap finding what you want to do and

409
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:40,380
where your reality levels lie free WiFi
hotspots there's lots of the same for

410
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:46,520
lots of prepaid options and there's lots
of really unsecured wireless I am not

411
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,230
advocating you go and crack your
neighbor's wireless but the reality is

412
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:59,390
if you're already in some more ambiguity
what's where you take it so again

413
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:08,549
getting online is easy to not have to
connect at your house so how much

414
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,500
protein really depends on your
provider's how much logging they're

415
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,640
doing what they're actually looking at
odds are you still going to have some

416
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,879
sort of information that identifies you
whether it's the profile username and

417
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,190
password whether it's a certificate the
issue to you whether method they're

418
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:26,820
doing to authenticate you do that
service is great because it encrypts and

419
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,300
decrypts your information but again it
doesn't answer providing real enmity

420
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,010
because they're still has to be some way
for you to connect service the only

421
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,710
anonymity you can really build in is
having an identity having a persona that

422
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,530
isn't tied to you are tied to your name
and again we're talking before about

423
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:51,490
sketchy providers there's some really
sketchy VPN providers more so than

424
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,540
anything else

425
00:41:52,540 --> 00:42:03,890
tour comes up for an anemone horrible
for security because you done any

426
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:09,109
reading you'll see there's been lots of
times where they're just bad bad eggs

427
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:14,509
and you don't know who's listening and
whoever is listening can easily mess

428
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:20,790
with the data that you're getting back
so it's great for being anonymous being

429
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:27,779
secure which is why the two combined a
lot of ups services that support it

430
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:37,930
where they'll be like yeah we'll
actually BPN the Tor network performance

431
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:44,890
it because anybody has ever used toward
knows it's really slow but in other ways

432
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:49,920
to build your own solutions but again
this goes back to the great if you're

433
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:57,430
going to have ups to do that it's more
stuff that you find your way it's a

434
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:02,830
larger imprint you're making renso your
actual c4 because I have control of

435
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:07,480
everything I'm doing but same time now
you have more stuff to worry about

436
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:24,310
and again it's all about energy or so
there's a lot of AOL accounts ensure

437
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:45,690
users people who are using it to try to
connect an so trying to avoid your

438
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,140
spouse's might actually work

439
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:55,910
reality is if they know your service
providers Comcast er et tu whoever they

440
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,080
may not necessarily be able to iTunes
together

441
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,840
viewpoint no talk to the past to work
today well they have a pretty good idea

442
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,100
of who's coming in and who's going out
of their network so they got involved

443
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:15,080
that figure out who you were the people
some of the people I put here scammers

444
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:23,480
but criminals and based in Eastern
Europe and Asia love to use AOL and

445
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,859
connect and is a form of proxy so they
look like they're coming out of the us-

446
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:29,730
they think they're not being watched

447
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,800
they won't be caught or they just don't
care because they have a thousand of

448
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:44,200
these 540 our CDs I I don't know but but
there are big fans of it so it's a bit

449
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:49,750
again like I said people who used to
work there and some of them you may

450
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,450
still have a pretty good idea what those
are

451
00:44:53,450 --> 00:45:01,470
goes on to their network is the bumpers
again so as to have you over 20,000

452
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:06,270
Ashley Madison accounts and IP isn't so
this comes back to where is the modern

453
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,300
so I don't know if this is a kind of
wondered if

454
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,540
yeah do corporations school yeah we're
not gonna care where people are going on

455
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:25,660
their BlackBerrys or a lot of personal
blackberries you know but yeah there's a

456
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:37,060
lot of blackberry like email addresses
was apparently really liked it didn't

457
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,920
think it was just never looks that for
anyway

458
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:49,100
earlier they're cheap and easy access to
dispose you know if you used one and you

459
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:54,400
had it as a laptop in America next year
if you put again depending on your level

460
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,930
paranoia just cheating on your spouse or
something

461
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:05,029
research oriented than going and having
to get a new laptop may not be as high

462
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:10,280
on your priority list rate but some
important not to cross the streams are

463
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:16,570
trying to close an interdimensional door
emails now there's lots of free options

464
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:23,790
so why in the hell are using your
Comcast email address validation in fact

465
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:29,259
gmail id still doesn't on some people
I've heard some people say oh you have

466
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:35,030
to have a phone if you try to create
your account from a known Google knows

467
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:42,990
as a as a proxy or an external very
common share point then they almost

468
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:46,339
always ask you for a credit card but
they're still places you can connect

469
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:51,870
through and some tourists in a June come
out of where they don't have a registers

470
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:55,000
such as he don't need a phone in even if
you do need a phone free food

471
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,890
prepaid phones are cheap and easy to use
as 15 second phone call with Gmail valid

472
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:06,730
information and then toss the phone
you'll never use it again

473
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:12,700
mil dot com don't think he even tries to
do validation any level Yahoo I know

474
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:22,020
does have a registered in outlook.com
email address again so what were they

475
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,960
thinking lots of corporate e-mails were
used

476
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,950
people's business addresses again it's
not it's not a foolproof method to

477
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:35,629
identify anybody but it is clear there
are a lot of really stupid people who

478
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:41,050
still do anyway there's a whole long
list of emails that are basically like

479
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:52,609
somebody's phone number for T Mobile MMS
gmail.com or whatever it is it's all

480
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:59,009
string of addresses like that uses
registrations in the in addition to all

481
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:03,780
the other information they have a lot of
people have not tried to validate and

482
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:10,850
there are a lot of those that are
overseas a lot of Europe and a lot of

483
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:19,580
Korea where this apparently seemed to be
really popular don't know again the

484
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,810
blackberry e-mails

485
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:29,609
school emails and then there's the what
the fuck there were over 12,000 there

486
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:35,869
are a lot of big numbers addresses in
their look perfectly legitimate I'm not

487
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:41,080
an expert on what are the legitimate .
no addresses but that's the sort of

488
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:46,859
break down some of the services that
were there an air force there about

489
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:51,869
another 2,200 dot gov addresses this
brings under state and federal employees

490
00:48:51,869 --> 00:49:00,640
because there while the states also have
dug of addresses mentions then I say

491
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,180
three of them are clearly faked there
was like what it was like admin at and

492
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,700
say that's legitimate

493
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:14,720
the postmaster and there was one called
I trust you not go so those are the only

494
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,459
one that looked like a potential bearish
sentiment to see a seven are FBI again

495
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:31,930
only to appear to be legitimate so there
are there are some emails but again

496
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:36,680
without the validation is no way to
clearly tell is this just a day actually

497
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,109
registered as somebody just making it up
because of all those emails writer

498
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:49,529
public knowledge a microSD just which
had over 57 I wasn't I didn't go through

499
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:55,869
all 57 but a lot of them did appear
legitimate so I don't know if the DHS

500
00:49:55,869 --> 00:50:06,280
tug of the TSA employees who might have
emails but yeah

501
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:25,700
different organizations 2200 dot gov
addresses or go through the name

502
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:32,189
information so I can validate the claims
but as i as i said a few times you can't

503
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:39,090
trust the emails if we trusted emails we
think he had one would think he had one

504
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:46,880
would think he'd have one he might have
one actually but but here's why we can't

505
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:54,870
trust it and that FBI FBI email us he
had so there was a Fox Mulder at FBI

506
00:50:54,870 --> 00:51:11,000
registered email so now I didn't know so

507
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:26,500
a lot of if you look to the credit card
purchases there's something like nine

508
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:46,040
and a half million of them there's
probably a lot of the purchases over and

509
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:56,350
over and over again so a couple of
truths about all this paranoia as I've

510
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:00,400
said over and over and over again a lot
of this is overkill

511
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:09,850
sides are you wouldn't need to do happen
this ads are doing anything alot of

512
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:19,500
corporations consider network monitoring
you wouldn't have to do this

513
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:28,320
is going great so again it's all about
it's all about what you're doing you're

514
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:33,040
worried about being seen by its gonna be
a few things for people who are looking

515
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:42,460
for ways to cheat old-fashioned cheating
is much cheaper I tried long and hard to

516
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:51,110
find that picture to him in reality
asset managers and charged a lot of

517
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:57,780
money for rural results if you're if
you're trying to be paranoid and you're

518
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,660
gonna have a burner phone you're gonna
have a supercomputer gonna have VPN

519
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:05,740
gonna do all this stuff it's all going
to cost you money you're still gonna

520
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,700
have a lot of same expenses she normally
you're still gonna have to find some

521
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:14,279
sketchy hotel to meet up with a red bar
deeds are still gonna be looking for

522
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,980
your divorce attorney at some point to
save money and go to a bar and pick up

523
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:24,870
some other sad drunk person who's there
with you trust me I prob I i would i

524
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,740
would imagine that probably had more
people probably cheated on their spouse

525
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:35,180
last year but picking up somebody at a
bar and they did a lot of this is just

526
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:45,330
common sense you know just how I am
running out of time of the goodness of

527
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:53,069
fit into my time so any other questions
I can try to answer I got one so you

528
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:59,620
were talking about buying a laptop or
something like that I mean it's almost

529
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:06,660
wonder whether wal-mart if you went
picked up about an HP to run Kalyan

530
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,549
couple of months ago whether the serial
numbers are actually tried all the way

531
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:19,110
to the Walmart so paranoid you could go
to another state on his by one there any

532
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:24,010
kind of I would be surprised if they're
not seeing as I mean maybe they aren't I

533
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:31,030
mean because I get why is here my head
as you look like the food recalls great

534
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,670
things can always say oh I know exactly
what stores all these things were

535
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:37,520
shipped to you right now granted there's
a lot more health and medical things

536
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,890
involved or if there's food poisoning
thing that you have to track so maybe

537
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:48,379
there is just more mandated tracking but
I think also yeah yeah so not only that

538
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,560
the rate of the companies and
distributors if you ever looked a lot of

539
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,279
places also have their own model numbers
of things to never buy from a shopping

540
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,430
club never buy from Costco or Sam's Club
almost always have their own model

541
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:08,000
versions of equipment so they can be
used to price match those things so so

542
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,610
you need to look be aware of things like
that because even if they're like ok we

543
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,910
tracked down the serial number so you
know it's a small thing over now we know

544
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:24,790
it went to Costco and I we know there's
a member or somebody else which is why

545
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:29,180
second hand is is good and so on

546
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,540
by some you-know-what when you get done
go sell your like really like oh yeah

547
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:38,190
use the stack everything computer second
into some schmuck up looking for you

548
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:45,430
will be like oh my god I was gonna say
really good operational security can be

549
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:49,980
expensive when you make the mention of
you verify the Gmail and then toss the

550
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,810
phone i mean you're you're talking
twenty thirty bucks at a minimum

551
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,328
operational fun and then started

552
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:05,599
toys R Us claims was clear I have ever
had a Four and not a Whore make it to

553
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,039
this like this like 45 paid five bucks
apiece for their own comments because it

554
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:14,390
was two years ago they weren't going to
carry the prepaid cell phones anymore

555
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:20,129
you know people want people to Toys R Us
and particularly what can I do like they

556
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,309
aren't thinking all I need to buy
cellphone so these things went from

557
00:56:23,309 --> 00:56:27,559
being like 30 40 bucks to late 2013
bucks that go back a few weeks later

558
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:30,430
they were now down in a single digits
and it's like you know what I would buy

559
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:36,979
this record don't ask what for
