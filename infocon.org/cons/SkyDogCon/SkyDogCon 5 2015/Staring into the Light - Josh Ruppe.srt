1
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,360
this talk staring into the light

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,530
the premise little bit of analysis on
tapping fiber-optic cables a little bit

3
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,050
about me

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,480
work as a senior security analyst in
atlanta been in the position for a

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,420
couple years there's the talk earlier
yesterday talking about you know the way

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,680
to get into the industry and I kind of
fought my way into the industry I

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,600
actually paid for a necessary license
for a few years and I was going

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,809
door-to-door in Norcross Georgia
knocking on doors asking you know you

9
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:52,910
want for your abilities can you want me
to try and break into your network and I

10
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,150
got enough experience gonna break into
the field you ever had a talking kinda

11
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:06,600
had that into it and had said that I've
also I did this presentation at DEFCON

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,839
this year the presentation of this year
b-sides and now here is going to contact

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,460
information that we're going through and
through

14
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,990
why you should tap give you a little bit
of a crash course in fiber optics I am

15
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:29,440
NOT fiber-optic expert by no means I
know enough to be dangerous but I can

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,170
get all of this is what you are talking
how life works and everything we're

17
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:42,670
going to go through I actually accessing
the fiber mid span been the fiber optic

18
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:50,950
tapping prevention methods and Q&A so
we're gonna start with double-a why

19
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,360
white at now I want to indemnify myself
first

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,350
you can't tattooing you're not supposed
tattooing is illegal

21
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,339
no one's allow it to tap things if you
don't have permission to tap things is

22
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,610
something you're not allowed to do even
if a company gives you permission to

23
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,430
even the company has to have it in their
documentation that says all the

24
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,700
consumers are aware they've agreed that
information be viewed by others as they

25
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,768
do not and it is legal

26
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,780
you can't do it no matter what they say
is something that's absolutely illegal

27
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,130
you cannot do without explicit
permission so

28
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,109
with that we're going to assume that you
do have permission so if you do have

29
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,310
permission there there are some products
out there available so you know you have

30
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,320
a clockwise on here there throwing star
leant app for cat5 cables had the

31
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,060
internet is a good company they make
good products the 11 o'clock position is

32
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:59,110
a cab file and the one below is a fiber
optics and then and the opposition to be

33
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,150
a stingray and also for cellphone
skimming cell phone tapping listen phone

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,600
calls and then to I just want to put it
in here to this the kind of dog I N S a

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,730
lil bit more as the infamous room 6:41
a.m. which is a room that used to exist

36
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:22,420
at AT&T data center in san francisco
exist about three years and in its a

37
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,910
basically went in there and put a bunch
of taps in that he had any data

38
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,350
whatsoever go to AT&T and that's that
area it went through that room and they

39
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:39,600
got all caught he said so that that
would you have permission to go into

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,290
fibers a little bit they're complicated
their condo more complicated and

41
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,440
capsized boat capsizes cover lines in
the inside where this is actually a

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,200
piece of glass that surprisingly
convened a van that takes a bit of

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,929
giving head wrapped around but to go
into fibers there's different types of

44
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,750
fibers yo singlemode and multimode these
are usually determined by you can tell

45
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,030
the outside by the color of the actual
jacket or enjoying like this is

46
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,140
multimode as yellow as single move it is
light turquoise sian colors Gigabit

47
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,169
multimode similar to multimodal a
difference being as as a man waving that

48
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,989
are carried

49
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,630
usually carries one and one one
direction is meant for longer spans

50
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,400
something that would prosecute estate
oceans and multimodal meant for shorter

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,770
distances they carry a multitude of
wavering on the inside

52
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:41,330
they go through W T in waverly person
management of simplex and duplex this

53
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:48,400
mean that duplex cable is fairly simple
concept as well so this is the place has

54
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,929
to hit two connectors cables once
retransmission once for receiving at

55
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,960
simplex it would just be one that's used
if you're just sending something to a

56
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,770
location and you're not expecting a
return back as usually more for telcos

57
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:09,060
have the whaling city travel inside the
actual fiber itself this varies as well

58
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,259
there is a slowly deprecating 859 meter
labeling there's the 13:39 demeanor

59
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:19,389
waving there's a fifteen 15 animator
waving and that kind of goes into the

60
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:24,620
realm of physics that I don't understand
but when you're going into what I'm

61
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,169
doing the tapping waving to you using
inside your fiber matters because if

62
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,330
you're trying to intercept a wavelength
at your tap cannot intercept not gonna

63
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,950
work yes

64
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:49,650
right I don't bring it cuz its delicate
little flower you can't handle it

65
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,179
roughly and I like to take place

66
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,590
BS alright so you're if you're not
looking if you're if you're in this case

67
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,989
your tap or the fiber media converter
using isn't set up to receive between

68
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,790
1500 meter and you're sitting at 13:30
is not going away and then blood at a

69
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:14,340
CSCS TLC there's about 20 more but it's
the type of connector design the end of

70
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,539
the actual fiber optic cable itself as
cedar square on the end it's easy round

71
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,090
metal connector as he's also a round
metal connector and LCR the more common

72
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,310
ones that you see in data centers
they're small they're smaller they got a

73
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:37,600
little bit like St connectors with more
rectangular in shape vertically so the

74
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,330
actual structure of the fiber cable is
kind of what matters most for what I'm

75
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,270
doing what we're talking about here and
just like cat5 cable has its own layers

76
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,940
as well as on the outside you have the
outer jacket I really need to say that

77
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,800
but yeah the outer jacket orange part
here in the picture on the inside you

78
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,650
have strength members or they're
basically kevlar fibers they're used to

79
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,840
take the brunt of the force it if
somebody's grabbing a table in doing

80
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,539
this the Kevlar fibers keep it keep the
pressure off the National glass fiber on

81
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:16,330
the inside and keep it on the fibers the
bumper is the white section sticking out

82
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:25,840
from the strength members and then the
cladding and then the fiber pitcher is

83
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,020
the actual fiber itself goes down to 60
microns in the cladding zone 25 microns

84
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,370
you see down here

85
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:39,070
multi modes are generally 62.5 biddy on
the internal the fiber with declining me

86
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:45,460
than 125 125 generally pretty standard
single mode says nine but you get real

87
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:53,830
accurate with his usually 8.3 really
make a difference that lower level but

88
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,969
in in doing this

89
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,910
like I said I'm not an expert in fiber
optics it this is something I decided to

90
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,120
explore earlier this year so I started
learning about fiber optics April I knew

91
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,750
nothing about them before other than
they were glass and I knew nothing about

92
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,470
them so I started reading I started
looking into it when I started

93
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,750
researching you know how you would tap
into a fiber optic cable I came across

94
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,230
you know of a standstill in trying to
figure out ok well if i if i buy this

95
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,270
coupler by the stabbing device how do I
get down to the internals of the fiber

96
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,819
optic cable cat5 cable or DVD disc if
you cut down into a new nicking 21

97
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,530
braided lines and the insides finds
wrapped up in electrical tape there is

98
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,490
no optical date you can't fix it wants
you Nick the cladding the fiber you cut

99
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,230
its done

100
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,190
hold a whole side of the duplex home
side's gone done can do anything else

101
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:56,240
with it so I had to figure out a less
invasive way to access the fiber itself

102
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:05,830
and that good bit of effort on my part I
do want to say okay somebody's watching

103
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:12,170
the somewhere and they decided to me out
somewhere I did not discover fiber-optic

104
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,979
tapping figured out how to do this

105
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,360
cars my fingers definitely agree with me
if if there's anyone else out there has

106
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,720
done this before me then by all means
the great as yours but I couldn't find

107
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,080
anything on how to access these things
and I call it like a Tripp Lite they

108
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,590
make fiber-optic cables they had no idea
how to get on the inside of their own

109
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,830
cables mid span one thing just cut the
end that's fine you can put a connector

110
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,700
on if you're going to places where you
need you cut too and you put them back

111
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,380
together or if you're putting a
connector on the chopping and access the

112
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,450
middle of it no one knew even fiber
optic installation companies I called

113
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,000
several black box they had no idea we
don't do something in their defense

114
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,810
there's no reason to Kenyans out of
these things no one has a reason to

115
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:02,040
access the middle of it mid span do that
you've ruined the cable at that point is

116
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,800
what's the cladding suppose you start
having all sorts of signalized so

117
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,390
it's really just for just doing this
there is no other reason why do it have

118
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,880
a cable here and I want to skip this
step because it takes long are you guys

119
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,820
wait on me but the first here's like it
says scored the jacket so that all this

120
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,100
middle ear that

121
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:31,060
375 not a salesman and hopefully he's
going to make it stuff this is a tool

122
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,018
primarily made for accessing these
cables again for the ends of the middle

123
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,910
of it but it still works what I needed
to do so there's three notches as you

124
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,219
can see there's like a little picture
like laser etched into the cutting tool

125
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,360
on the top there that larger hole is
actually MIT or scouring the jacket when

126
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:57,070
you're doing that you have Jackie
political and the other end you about

127
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:03,870
three inches or so for that I'm doing so
once you do that that's not the whole

128
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,579
sections separated and you move on so
after that you can get the jacket he had

129
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:15,380
to remove it and a jacket made of PVC
not nothing is not easy to peel and even

130
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,279
still you don't want to appeal it
because there's five rockets on the

131
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,630
inside any kind of stress on them can
cut them or break them so what you have

132
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:29,480
to do is slowly going away at the jacket
and it's more like a slight their

133
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,240
slicing motion so hard to get to this so
what you do is this just might hear

134
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:47,310
exactly how I don't know this might be
my skin I don't know but clearly I got

135
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,390
so many scars on these two things here
and even their presentation at DEFCON

136
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,470
right into my finger doing it likely to
Boy Scouts in the crowd gave me a

137
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,670
band-aid unexpectedly

138
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,589
I give him credit everywhere I go like
so what you wanna do you just want to

139
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:08,860
slowly cut away at the jacket itself and
it is a slow process in the section that

140
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,540
you're doing you want to slowly just
going about my entire sections you get

141
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:28,410
there and once that's done you wanna
kill off the deck jacket short answer

142
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:35,100
know these things do not like he the
fiber itself once the heats up it's like

143
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,570
a metal heated up and don't pull that
off writing is really brittle and while

144
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:49,660
I was gone do this and it makes a
classic Brit really really brutal

145
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,819
once that's gone you're left with this
the United had the strength members and

146
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:04,130
to see a little white right here is that
the fiber itself on the inside so now

147
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:26,200
what you want to do is yet to take all
those fibers aside and Kevlar and I

148
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,040
tried it with another night I don't
think it seems so you have something

149
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,819
fairly sharp in order to cut through
this so now you're just left with the

150
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,540
actual buffers that's all that's left
and this was this is easy to get to

151
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,520
anybody has an idea has patience and
steady hand that's gonna do this part of

152
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,750
the easy part now you have to get on the
inside of this where they're getting

153
00:13:52,750 --> 00:14:00,000
difficult lol yeah I was like I'm gonna
burn this tradeoff and then I did have

154
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,810
the fiber sitting there just the fire
that burned the cladding off to a need

155
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,569
the cladding that didn't work so I
started in my head and I

156
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,450
Google googling how to remove

157
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:18,810
got two names at the buzzer in the
coding same thing had removed this fiber

158
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,420
optic cable online and Google nothing
came up next page nothing came out

159
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,900
surprisingly on the fourth page I
remember the same reason for the page of

160
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:33,170
Google results there was an academic
academic article written by some guy

161
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:39,949
decide how you get a co2 laser burn well
I went outside and i dont have one so I

162
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:46,000
couldnt uses it on to the next I did so
gotta looking around and got to thinking

163
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,630
out I was at this point I'd already but
Michael Perez I can do this is no

164
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,189
problem can be hard to get to this thing
so excited was on i'ma get this little

165
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:59,960
skin remover here and slowly cut that
doesn't work so well as once you

166
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,500
actually get into the actual buffer here
in this white here this is the old ones

167
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,940
why there's probably some reason they do
that well actually there is reason to

168
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:13,940
that and some fiber optic cables you get
into where this buffer here is like

169
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,250
right against the cladding has got a
tight buffered configuration you have

170
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,800
some fiber optic cables that are in a
loose buffered configuration so when you

171
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,979
gonna send the buffers larger is larger
like the actual jacket here is there's

172
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,750
several cladding of several fibers on
the inside line voltage like eight or

173
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:36,150
nine or so you could indeed when she
opened up falling out everywhere that's

174
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,270
lovely but you don't get those in
datacenters those will be outside

175
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:49,030
somewhere in as little as outside the
road AT&T phones and whatnot so yeah so

176
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:54,810
I was like a slice of life so thing is
though the fibers clear you can't see it

177
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,910
so when you start Sunday slices the way
you don't know where you're at

178
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,510
could you can't see it and the first
time does luckily I had a friend of mine

179
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:09,230
it were to know datacenter and he's like
I got a bunch of great thing was he

180
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:16,680
didn't tell me from my 1992 and no I do
television win these abigail is being

181
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,930
made that they were insanely brittle

182
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,380
and goodnight I guess it's a thing that
the glass inside these fibers to get

183
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:29,800
very brittle overtime very true I found
glass who knows I know it does confirmed

184
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,170
here so that did not work so I was like
ok well I had to do something that I was

185
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,229
a month out from DEFCON that point out
so freaking out I was gonna mess it up

186
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,610
so I got the idea

187
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:52,600
chemically strip so I called the people
who make this stuff or not this time

188
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:01,630
fiber-optic cables themselves I called
them and I said I need to know what the

189
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,520
bumper / cladding on your fiber optic
cables and Mr remembers and you know

190
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,510
this is made us they came back said we
don't know how they please find out a

191
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:19,230
couple of emails two weeks it up in the
figure it out accurately like a flexible

192
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:27,059
for reform of great people what is a
solvent for acrylate silence is like

193
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,860
acetone on steroids

194
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,090
get on your hands not good make these
daily Susan burns and take showers and

195
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,760
that's not fun stuff

196
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,629
good weeks so you get this and I really
want to do it this room gonna smell like

197
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,620
they're gonna come in here thinking
you're doing drugs or something but you

198
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:58,178
get this much that's in this class here
to save $1.00 to build up about a

199
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,679
quarter way or so you don't need much as
I get it in there now is probably

200
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,570
correct myself I didn't strip it off it
doesn't dissolve it I know why doesn't

201
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:15,379
my playlist not his I'm a doctor anyway
so it is what it does is it the actual

202
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:22,600
planting them to buffer the buffer in
the coding / absorbs it is ordered

203
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,649
really really well and the stuff isn't
like a slice it will desire by brave

204
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,270
very very quickly this is not States
reverend

205
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,070
house smells lovely

206
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:38,490
so it'd be nice so you like that sitting
there 10 mins or so and when that gets

207
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,970
done you're able to get the buffering
now pull it backwards is very rubbery at

208
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,570
that point prior to that it's not it's
just like this Jackie Nurse Jackie is

209
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,889
very stiff very rigid or so and a jacket
will do the same thing it gets very

210
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:59,178
robberies well so it softens up so it is
very soft and you're able to pull it

211
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,100
back and you can do you have fun with
his like Plato Plato is like something

212
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,449
very very rubbery you go back and forth
with it as a good thing as what you want

213
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,340
you want to access the cladding on the
inside and that's now I'm able to do

214
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,980
that and little kimwipes down here share
your you get these in these are these

215
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:26,269
are called delicate task wipers right on
time today the you get this in these are

216
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:29,909
actually using fiber-optic industry to
clean fiber-optic cables when people are

217
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:34,700
slicing they're putting into connectors
on and that's a whole that beast in

218
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,179
itself when you start putting in
connectors on them but they use these to

219
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:41,350
clean them up as you had to use certain
chemicals that clean the fiber than you

220
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:48,370
had this gimmick or so of course all the
liquid index matching jail and it's a

221
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,320
jail that has some sort of properties
inside of it that helps match the index

222
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,480
of the glass to whatever you're putting
it into so like the connectors so these

223
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,370
these whites are used to dry out and
clean up the fiber optic cable and it

224
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:10,779
doesn't it doesn't damaged in anyway so
now we've got on the inside now going to

225
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:15,139
be in light couple things in this video
I like this which is interesting that

226
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:19,269
you're not done with these these jackets
are a little weird to think but when I

227
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:24,210
take it up that should have brought in
hindsight but when you actually meet

228
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,629
jack off touched on a jacket on with the
cladding I've done this and if you get a

229
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:32,320
little red laser pointed down here
you'll see it light up in here is a

230
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,759
visible light you can't do that because
we were talking about earlier I can see

231
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,129
them so you can do this it does this
because life is not like being told what

232
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:43,059
to do

233
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:43,760
does

234
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:53,080
laws of nature but you can't you guys
write guidelines you get to boss around

235
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,629
but if you go into a datacenter you'll
always see the any fiber insulation they

236
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:04,560
have there when it comes out of you know
some source which or something that's a

237
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,310
nice soft green line goes up top is a
nice job losses I know these things and

238
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,220
it is it is Ben's all night softly
nicely to the data center and they do

239
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,210
that because every time you been did you
lose a little bit of light and that

240
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,670
happens because as I should mention
several slides ago the cladding actually

241
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,900
keep the light on the inside the fiber
is sort of like they think of it like a

242
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,440
like a bouncer and everything else that
the outside the the fiber sort of like

243
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,570
the inside the club but analogy but it
keeps all the lightning in size when the

244
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:43,389
likely put a straw and a glass of water
how it ends when he gets inside a total

245
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,960
total internal reflection and I said
that right right

246
00:21:48,960 --> 00:22:02,620
reflection I'm sorry is it

247
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:09,770
anyway total internal with an arson are
declining what happens is the virus

248
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,710
would just let the light on the inside
the fiber tries to get the fiber

249
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,720
constantly is always trying to do it the
cladding has a higher refractive index

250
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,240
has a higher refractive index and it
bounces delight back into the fiery

251
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,440
carries it all the way down however when
you bend it too far

252
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,380
it cannot do it you can't be in
something so much you only sent it back

253
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,309
so as such an angle so it starts to
escape at that point and they're able to

254
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,678
point don't do this whole distraction as
bad you can't do that you do a couple

255
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,040
times are continuously do that if you
keep saying this for a long time

256
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,770
eventually you're gonna something they
go down there gonna find it

257
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:59,740
think somewhere so on to the tap so I
bought it at and that was an awkward

258
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,340
conversation when I call these people
and they're like oh you just say so what

259
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,510
company do you work for

260
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,780
important individualize I need this
they're like well we don't need to sell

261
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,710
this voice technician so that the name
for this thing is a fiber-optic clip-on

262
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,490
cover it is used by telecom
professionals to test voice data lines

263
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,080
and there will be a guide somewhere
somewhere inside the road and I'll have

264
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,040
this in the back of a truck parked next
to one of the pedestals and has a little

265
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,170
thing gonna sit next to a heads it I
decided if I brought at the club a

266
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,990
couple errands a little yellow fiber
cable single mode as an SEC connector in

267
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,240
the end of it that screws into this is
this little box inside the heads as a

268
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,300
public fiber media converter into some
sort

269
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,590
well then there's another guy fifty
miles away doing the same thing and they

270
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,970
get on the same voice line and that said
I was able single tones back and forth

271
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,010
in stone back and forth and they know
that one voice data lines working as

272
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,540
it's supposed to end to their on the
same lines as they can market and put it

273
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:08,379
in whatever goes into in that big box on
the side of the road so when I call them

274
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,669
and they're like oh ok well you normally
sell this stuff to AT&T

275
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:16,379
comcast's well I don't work for
companies I'm just give you the money

276
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:21,658
you got it into conversation earlier I
love you want to do it that's fine and

277
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:29,840
so clearly off for my wife was adult
about this

278
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:38,139
CA no I can't think of that very first
you like you only the unit tell people

279
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:43,570
what to do I want to tell us this is a
proven fact it's not easy on television

280
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,080
that is true so she is she eventually
relented let me get it now to give a lot

281
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,759
of credit for that little plug so the
accident this this is what it looks like

282
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,879
it's multiple devices not very large
private cabin and therefore scale but if

283
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:07,869
it's about this longer so and about that
very fits in the palm of your hands best

284
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:08,639
way to put it

285
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:17,409
thing is is right

286
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:22,910
this little cover here with the screws
on it or so

287
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,200
inside there I have an open it up I
called and asked and I said you know I

288
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,230
wanna look at the internals to it I
don't do that everything said they're

289
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,590
certainly you do it is going to ruin and
you have to send it back to us a lot of

290
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,100
money to fix alright well what's in
there and there's a series of mirrors in

291
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,340
prisons that take the light actually
next like it takes delight as it comes

292
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,260
down said you had to get down to
declining US by removing the buffer zone

293
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,920
born so as it gets down it bends and
this little wheel here is officially

294
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:59,060
called the guide will and this little
track right here if called the prison

295
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:04,020
roof though when the fiber goes in this
will and you can sort of thing it's very

296
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:11,190
hard to do and there's a tiny little
group right here in the room and the

297
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,900
cladding sits in there and then as you
when you put this down a little bit of

298
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,240
forced to do there's another little
group in here and the bottom of the

299
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:29,170
prison and fiber sits in there so as you
can also see the track here this is

300
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:35,630
metal that metal that's medal this right
here in the middle class so when you

301
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:42,060
bend it that's a little bit he's certain
section there takes delight this leaking

302
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,320
out from the cladding since it down
there is a real mess amir's down here

303
00:26:45,320 --> 00:27:00,750
and then out the other side so yes

304
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:07,490
right other hypertext do this for the
official purpose of testing voice lines

305
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,660
were they had also had to have access
and answers yes however they don't have

306
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:16,370
to do what I did on the side the roads
and in these or pencil boxes in up in

307
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:21,790
telephone poles the Meadowlands on the
wooden on the inside of these are these

308
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,940
all trades and they're called splice
trays so on the inside a slight raise a

309
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,320
little plastic case but it takes a bit
of a CD tray with little longer small

310
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,220
retailers

311
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:39,440
you open that up there are several
spools of by Robert cladding the sitting

312
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,330
in there without the party was being
asked to remove so there's more to 2002

313
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,570
sitting in there and from my
understanding that's in there because

314
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,770
they named a need to do something with
it later so they need lots and lots of

315
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,700
spare but they have those in there and
they usually from what I understand I

316
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,690
try to be amazed when you're not looking
for someone for AT&T pulled over on the

317
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,430
side of the road they're everywhere you
go and you can't find one anywhere with

318
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:09,180
a tell me things I need to know so I can
find one at all when I get back late on

319
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,410
Monday everywhere all over the place so
I'm understanding is on the inside door

320
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:19,220
inside the predecessors of book
somewhere somewhere that all the little

321
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:24,110
color classes are all able to say that
this goes to offer it as goes to do you

322
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:57,360
know what are known as hearsay

323
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:08,370
surprisingly so I guess I wasn't present
to discover new figured it out I'm just

324
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,100
a guy who just went to the links
actually show it's possible I got

325
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,199
frustrated as I gotta looking into it
the only thing that I could find was

326
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,340
accompanied by name of InfraGard 2007
they did it

327
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,520
another presentation on this some
security conference in London slides of

328
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,790
los videos lost everything as long as
there's no information anywhere but this

329
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:33,110
now accept my website if you if you look
here on their run against the left hand

330
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,070
side we're looking at the cladding
here's actually read and when i call and

331
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,350
talk to this guy in Sweden I say he
called me very nice gentleman actually

332
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,570
when he called me he said they didn't
they didn't go through the process of

333
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,129
accessing inside I know I was too
difficult we can figure out so they they

334
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,669
got a guy to come in and he brought
actually some telecom lines and they

335
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:56,780
spice connectors on the connectors on
the end of them that's what you read

336
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,490
these color ones are typically like he
said in you know they can be

337
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,730
distinguished from this one is open it
up

338
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:11,559
clear see straight through it so this is
very much all you need to start your own

339
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:18,790
National Security Agency obviously I had
actually forgotten so yeah you can see

340
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:26,350
the little guy here inside the actual
will and you can see a little well it

341
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:32,510
goes into that that's a good shot at
this is the wrong way they look exactly

342
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:39,610
like it says in the islands as promoting
single fiber media converter like $25

343
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:45,760
and then a Raspberry Pi to just using
these in itself you can do this you

344
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,250
could pull up next anyplace and open a
fiber optic cables are tapping it don't

345
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,450
do that but you could if you wanted to
have permission to do it I'm not

346
00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:00,630
advocating that in any way but this is
are you in need but actually want to

347
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:05,470
show you it actually working but i dont
wanna play in this video someone go back

348
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:13,169
and display here the full screen and I'm
a positive along the way

349
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:24,830
alright so there's a black raspberry pie
right here and this is the spending side

350
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:31,309
of my setup so this residence is exactly
what I did it this side of the pie since

351
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:35,470
the data to the receiving side as
pioneer other side though it since it in

352
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,230
over the cat5 cable in 25 media
converter for immediate order then comes

353
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,440
out

354
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:51,400
go I thought why did this to try and get
the right timing for it saying all right

355
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,030
then you move on so now yes you can see
the white one there you see the white

356
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,970
one here that's on the receiving side
not on the transmit side which is also

357
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,929
important cause of your trade your that
matters it depends on what you're trying

358
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:07,400
to attach trying to trap people
connecting something you have to be on

359
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,140
that side the five were trying to
connect the response of the fiber and

360
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:20,150
you'll see on these things so it but the
TX line coming down in his client down

361
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:29,289
in the cellar now no just one dissenting
as I don't care about the receiving side

362
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:32,830
but I want to get people's credentials
not not coming back seems like yeah we

363
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:37,720
got some good not as I want to see the
connection going by so under receiving

364
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,679
side the fiber comes back up

365
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,740
goes into another fiber media converter
get five back into the white raspberry

366
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:51,420
pie is the receiving is running an FTP
server

367
00:32:51,420 --> 00:33:02,970
wifi card in there for some reason right
now they're they're sitting in there is

368
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:08,960
what it was like clamped down on the
amount of is actually shut right so then

369
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:18,520
the yellow cable comes out the side and
i dont im good I can't think so yes it

370
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,740
yellow singlemode fiber comes out of
this funk up their balls up and it goes

371
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:30,390
here and that is a sc2 as see making a
doctor and as I said earlier and see

372
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:37,720
doctor is medal round metal actual
connector part protrudes out of it so

373
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,910
then that goes into you transmit side
I'm sorry the receiving side this other

374
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,450
53 these things that then goes down I
want to trace is only want to play clean

375
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:58,670
BS on it and then it goes away into my
laptop so I wanna do I'm going to type

376
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:07,560
in the IP address this screen here is
coming from the output on these sending

377
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:16,620
Raspberry Pi I'm going to paint the ATP
Raspberry Pi some opinion you'll see

378
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:23,940
that ICMP request goes up as you back up
if you look here on the sending one

379
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,070
there on the receiving line every time a
pain goes through I'll blink in unison

380
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:37,120
that shows a day that they're sending a
packet every time I think every town so

381
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,650
that's good

382
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:48,340
clear right magic doing so now I'm going
to start capture on Ethernet Sarah on

383
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:53,740
the on the attackers laptop so here I am
again paying it and I'm capturing the

384
00:34:53,739 --> 00:35:03,560
ping request going through line back a
little bit I think I do ya doing here is

385
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,750
every time one of these parts

386
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,810
up another line pop up down here

387
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,170
other point is when you actually go and
you do this

388
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:18,240
tap your your only calling about 3d be
loss on the fiber line and that you get

389
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,600
more about his wrapping around your
finger and pleasure looking for tools

390
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,870
out there and is monitoring appliances
in the hard way out there to look for if

391
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:30,759
you're not looking for you'd never know
that he's nothing but in a 3d be a loss

392
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:43,630
you get a hundred percent of the data
going through the line

393
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,910
now I'm going to do

394
00:35:47,910 --> 00:36:06,040
open and FTP connection to the white
raspberry pipe in the black rosary

395
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:21,600
attract ones there's the captured
username going through

396
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:31,390
I'm typing in the password there do not
like me and successfully and everyone

397
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:38,430
here knows that they are captured that I
think I go back up and running with more

398
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:45,799
command

399
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,670
Alyssa directories that are available to
me and goes down

400
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:59,040
captures that is well there

401
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:09,300
actually so I yeah there you can see the
user Elliott so good there's the user

402
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:21,140
password here and then be listening to
directories on that TV

403
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:35,799
captured the quick question that's that
no

404
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:46,780
television thank you say this is
essentially what I did there is a much

405
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:53,950
larger 'he's resolution version a
website that matters here so obviously

406
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,700
here the TX is being captured by the
company goes into receiving side here

407
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,359
and then vice versa and then the couple
goes up into the attackers by media

408
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:12,570
converter into his laptop so repetitive
question I had in common was what I do

409
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:19,060
you defend against something like this
always there to get out to a hardware

410
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:25,110
level they they make a manufacturer a
bend insensitive cable that when you go

411
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:30,250
to bend it it actually will not let any
light legal the cladding it does is a

412
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,960
couple ways this is how people have
gotten round patents as multiple ways of

413
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:41,320
doing it but one way is where you
actually have here so we actually have

414
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,420
the fiber and then the cladding that
would be around it in between the fiber

415
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,480
in the cladding they put like michael
has to be a micron or two layer of

416
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,660
plastic or and other labor acrylate in
between there that late win if it does

417
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,390
get bent the light still stays inside of
it it's it's another layer just to keep

418
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:03,500
the reflection inside another method
that i've seen

419
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,630
is there's a small tiny has to be a
micrometer to air gap in between there

420
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:15,220
and I guess that s enough just to keep
the light on the inside but a bottom

421
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:22,100
innocence and cable and put it in a set
up a cut down to the cladding and I put

422
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,180
it into the tap didn't work

423
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:32,930
ok well it works as advertised it but I
like it can't be that good so I say this

424
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:40,299
stuff this afternoon that they make any
difference like okay so then how about

425
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,270
some index matching jail the stuff out
talking about earlier that helps match

426
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:44,849
up

427
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:49,299
air gaps when they're putting in
connector on that stuff is $40 for three

428
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:57,210
ounces insanely expensive like printer
so which is more than gasoline buyout by

429
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:02,789
about that I what I did then I i dont
have picture this is something I

430
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:09,950
recently did I just want to continue
this on but I got my direct 375 again I

431
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,149
got this in the last night's down here
is actually bored stripping the cladding

432
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,910
off the fiber so you actually just grab
this script right now and you can do

433
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,649
that

434
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:24,660
cladding this Lakes office not mean it
is literally 75 microns or something

435
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:34,769
that isn't nothing microns alright we'll
go with that matter how hard I use this

436
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:39,008
and I got the cladding and I scored it
like I scored the jacket beginning on

437
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:43,079
both sides and then let it sit night
index matching Joel overnight next day

438
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:50,890
Saturday night were they are put it back
in this again and I actually got some

439
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,129
packets going through there and get them
all but it was but I'm assuming

440
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:59,650
happening is that that tiny little air
gets in there that index matching Joshi

441
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:05,019
like kind of seats in there and when it
goes to bend its completing that aired

442
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:08,788
in there and letting the light passes
through properly into the coupler I'm

443
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:12,440
still working the kinks out on it but it
didn't work some on the right track with

444
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:18,559
it they are so there's been in since the
cables but the easiest way to do it is

445
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,739
to use encryption if you and created it
doesn't matter to attack your stuff

446
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:27,450
because it's garbage that point not
successfully as a three but that's not

447
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:32,098
new that point but yes it to me that
that is a way of doing it is is pretty

448
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:36,450
much foolproof disappoint you had to get
all the data in order to decrypt in the

449
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:42,009
first place but you'd be amazed how many
places don't do this and I looked into

450
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:47,759
that and is apparently got to spread it
could be completely wrong is repeating

451
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:52,339
is not my number 64 percent of all days
do not increase their outgoing five

452
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:56,960
airlines in the united states I got some
news

453
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,400
website I don't know if accurate it
seemed accurate look accurate but I

454
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:09,640
don't know so that that's kind of mood
for that and they are in most of the

455
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,900
stuff that layer 2 also there's couple
companies that make these these devices

456
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,420
are you just pop in once I have no money
either side and it does it's magic in

457
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:25,550
between CSO this is kind of the way to
pull an attacking whatsoever so with

458
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:47,089
that question yes yes you

459
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:53,239
it should be I mean it would obviously
if they were doing something properly

460
00:42:53,239 --> 00:43:00,299
are supposed to but I think if I'm right
by default you know I think that yeah

461
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:16,470
right

462
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:36,230
answers now

463
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:45,340
right the government's this will be so
yes what they did so what what what

464
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:50,080
you're talking about is the government
actually retrofitted the UN system and

465
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,210
Carter and they I'm assuming I don't
know the details to about I'm assuming

466
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,350
they put some soda dry dock on the
inside of it or something and they

467
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:02,368
basically put it on the bottom of the
ocean floor pull the cable up into it

468
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:12,270
and basically started tap on it I go
back to this slide you'll see is

469
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:17,170
apparently says be somewhat accurate but
you'll see on the east west coast there

470
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:28,470
and that's how they did it a day
outfitted nuclear sub to do that

471
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:34,819
data's

472
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:48,020
so I guess I had a pattern that earlier
yes once you actually put this in here

473
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,660
and I did this home I was curious to us
like we know I can give you can give

474
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:56,540
your answer at all a bit more 2012 with
a long-term effects this was good the

475
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,529
cladding sometimes is glass sometimes is
accurately itself or some other compound

476
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:08,210
material and so actually set this up
after DEFCON and I but the pies and

477
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:13,680
there was blood in later on and let it
go a whole month and that was fine this

478
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,109
costly pained ICMP request number too
high

479
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:22,900
president but it was fine is doing its
thing in my concern was when I was

480
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,610
thinking that was will over time that
connect coupler it clamps down pretty

481
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:31,760
hard and it's once and they're mean that
you have to like on papa doc is not it

482
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,000
is a lift its got like to it I was
concerned that it was going to put a

483
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,590
depression the cladding and I'm sure
over time it probably would but removing

484
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:47,200
a tap yes not mean it's not good once
you get into this and this little

485
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,439
buggers gone that band is leaking all
sorts of light all over the place so

486
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,050
once you remove it

487
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,640
you know there's a light leaking out the
cladding from then on out there always

488
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:04,230
gonna have that loss in the cable

489
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:12,030
yes there's there's pieces are hard
workers in the gonna go to Dr hopefully

490
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,390
optical time something reflectometer

491
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:21,529
alright so basically it's a piece of
hardware that you're a used to gauge

492
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:26,200
signal loss and fiber optic cables over
the over like from point A to point B so

493
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,640
you get to a point you unplug it plug
into the OTDR it tells you this is how

494
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,830
much your signal strength is plug it
back in

495
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:37,500
go to your next stop there and as you go
you're going to see obviously I would

496
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:43,660
like a little else he's been there
several thousand dollars for plugging

497
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,450
and unplugging us worst up that so your
salary graph

498
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:53,000
slowly goes down over time for signal
strength and when you have a tap-in

499
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,930
there you'll see us a little sharp drop
but again it's 3d be so you have to

500
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:02,100
bring the scale up to see something of
that small-scale you know beyond a graph

501
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:06,618
but it's gonna be there will be another
so once it's out you know like jon said

502
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:19,650
you could probably pain it hurts anyway

503
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,730
reviewed data center that you could do
that depending on the length of an

504
00:47:24,730 --> 00:48:09,450
office from 1800 yeah everybody lives
right you can't replace that cable

505
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:14,200
probably fifty miles long and if you cut
it you know where it where the

506
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,529
connection was working is now not
working in there is an 18 the guy out

507
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:21,180
there to work on it then when he gets
there is not going to talk to you in any

508
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:32,960
way you don't have anything to do with
the other knowledge I thanks
