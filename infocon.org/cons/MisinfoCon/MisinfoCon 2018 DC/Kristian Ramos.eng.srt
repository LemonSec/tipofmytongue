1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,680
and now for something completely

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,430
different this is actually very good

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,200
that we followed because mine is a bit

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,150
more of a practical application of some

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,980
of those things that were just discussed

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,920
first a little bit about define American

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,839
we were founded by the Pulitzer Prize

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,490
winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas

9
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,689
and we combat anti-immigrant

10
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,029
misinformation in mainstream media and

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:24,720
increasingly

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,080
as we've discovered online and across

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,980
social media platforms I think that

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,600
about sums up what we do so why this

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,879
matters I want to do some table setting

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
for everybody here we're at a point in

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,300
American history where we are debating

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,219
whether or not we want to be letting

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,739
people legally into the United States

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,950
from outside countries we are at a point

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,989
in a country where we are putting

22
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,960
children into cages at our southwest

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,750
border we are at a point in our country

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,820
history where we're deporting veterans

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,570
business owners and in many cases

26
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,790
detaining American citizens because of

27
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,030
the color of their skin now you're

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,619
thinking what does this have to do with

29
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,619
miss infocon well I'm here to tell you

30
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,740
that a lot of this was made possible by

31
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,750
the dissemination of misinformation on

32
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,290
the Internet

33
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,810
a lot of this has been made possible by

34
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,450
our buddy here Pepe the Frog and a lot

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,259
of the stuff that used to exist on

36
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:32,670
Reddit and 4chan and so more pointedly

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,000
all of this was made possible because

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,150
there are a lot of people at family

39
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,759
barbecues that casually share racist

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,810
memes of Michelle Obama looking like a

41
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,899
monkey and nobody thinks twice because

42
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,810
of the way that these networks and

43
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,570
platforms have siloed so much of these

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,049
conversations and so we're in a place

45
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,340
where a lot of this stuff has been

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,170
completely normalized right this quote

47
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,390
my only quibble with Trump is that

48
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,610
number one it's legal immigrants too and

49
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,110
number two there are no good ones from

50
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,920
Ann Coulter this is 2015

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,520
she said this this was considered a joke

52
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,380
nobody would take this seriously but

53
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,870
again we are debating in the United

54
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,580
States government whether or not we

55
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,700
should be letting legal immigrants come

56
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,060
into this country we're putting children

57
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,030
in cages again this used to be the stuff

58
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,060
of jokes now it is the policy of the

59
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,720
government

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,270
we're deporting veterans business owners

61
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,250
students Americans in every way but

62
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,709
their legal status there was a person

63
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:46,410
who was an American citizen in Los

64
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,760
Angeles who was detained for almost

65
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,880
three months because of the color of his

66
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,830
skin and so we have to start with a

67
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,500
simple idea and again we go back to

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,670
memes and these these sort of

69
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,130
conversations in 2012 Mitt Romney

70
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,660
introduced this idea of self deportation

71
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,470
where you make the country so awful for

72
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,299
people who are not here with

73
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,010
documentation that they would just leave

74
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,950
and it was treated as a joke by the

75
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,799
mainstream media people laughed at

76
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,900
people said this is an unserious policy

77
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,340
not worthy of the President of the

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,160
United States and he lost right and if

79
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,480
people don't work here they're going to

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,750
self-deport eight deep deport to a place

81
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,230
where they can get work now I really

82
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,640
want to focus in on 2012 because

83
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,650
something happened between 2012 and 2016

84
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,930
that's important right let's look go

85
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,570
back to 2012 he lost all the Latino vote

86
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,519
he lost the Asian vote he lost everybody

87
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,709
he was inspired to this country Donald

88
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,160
Trump our current president said this

89
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,340
brightly so flash forward to 2016

90
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,230
they're bringing drugs they're bringing

91
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,630
crime they're rapists and some I assume

92
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,060
are good people everybody knows this

93
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,829
quote everybody thought it was funny at

94
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,859
the time but what's fascinating about

95
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,310
this is where did this come from where

96
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,139
did this that this this notion this

97
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,600
change and I would argue I don't know

98
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,560
how many of you guys are familiar with

99
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,959
the tanta Network here in this room in

100
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,840
DC not a lot of people what's

101
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,070
interesting about the tenten network is

102
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,820
that were founded

103
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,240
in the late 1970s early 80s by a

104
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,400
gentleman by the name of John Tintin who

105
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,440
was a eugenicist who literally believes

106
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,250
the people of color have smaller heads

107
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,009
or inferior doesn't believe that they

108
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,479
should exist the United States how many

109
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,289
of you guys saw infinity war wow I

110
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:48,820
thought I would think more but that's

111
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,520
fine

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,470
spoiler alert it the whole thing is

113
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,050
predicated upon one man believing that

114
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,870
he needs radical environmentalism which

115
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,849
is the he's going to half the population

116
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,639
and that's going to be what saves the

117
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,009
universe John tantan believes that we

118
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,770
needed to half the population in the

119
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,210
United States because we had a finite

120
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,520
amount of resources and things in this

121
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,400
country so we had to get rid of all

122
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,410
immigrants and probably a lot of people

123
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,590
of color he founded these organizations

124
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,509
the Federation for America American

125
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,120
immigration reform the Center for

126
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,340
Immigration Studies and numbers USA and

127
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,669
so what's important to sort of take from

128
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:34,599
all of this is from 2012 to 2016

129
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:38,110
these guys were considered jokes nobody

130
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,030
in DC took them seriously nobody here

131
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,180
knows who they are right that I think is

132
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,979
very telling and what's important about

133
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,580
this is without a mainstream audience or

134
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,139
a government that took their extremist

135
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:53,320
agenda seriously they had no means of

136
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,760
implementing a lot of the crazy stuff

137
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,970
that they did enter Steve Bannon he gets

138
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,110
the internet around 2012 and his his

139
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,419
main idea here is he goes on reddit he

140
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,210
goes on 4chan and he sees people sharing

141
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,090
all of these crazy racist memes he sees

142
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,470
that there's an audience for this he

143
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,349
sees that there's a market for this and

144
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,509
as a part of that market he builds a

145
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,180
network he builds a Breitbart he builds

146
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,639
he works with alex jones and all these

147
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,289
online things where it's safe and okay

148
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:29,139
to that to do that stuff but he doesn't

149
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,360
have a means to mainstream this stuff

150
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,300
yet well the internet's isn't is another

151
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,190
sort of place where he can do this and i

152
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,570
think this is an important thing right

153
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,340
around this

154
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,660
you see the average number of Twitter

155
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,480
followers per hate group type

156
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,910
skyrocketing anti-muslim anti-immigrant

157
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,340
you're looking at a significant number

158
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,750
seventeen thousand five hundred

159
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,750
sixty-nine right there is a market being

160
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,090
built for this at the same time these

161
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,820
hate groups their influence is growing

162
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,020
average number of likes per hate group

163
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,690
also increases to seven point six eight

164
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,570
in 2012 that number was point to one it

165
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,979
was less than one percent there wasn't

166
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,949
really that market for it at the same

167
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,110
time these organizations are reloading

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,290
numbers USA growing its budget this is

169
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,840

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,550
eighteen thousand over over eighteen

171
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,900
million dollars these guys have and

172
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,260
they're doing a lot of their marketing

173
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,590
and their growth online because that's

174
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,570
where their audiences but they still

175
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,090
don't have the ability to take their

176
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,979
online audience offline enter Donald

177
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,169
Trump he wins the election and what ends

178
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,490
up happening is all of these

179
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,620
organizations have relationships in

180
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,630
Congress they all spend a lot of money

181
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,770
lobbying this stuff they have people

182
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,510
that go and work for DHS they have

183
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,889
people that go and work for the

184
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,539
administration Stephen Miller Steve

185
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,400
Bannon these guys all have close ties to

186
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,810
these things and are taking a lot of

187
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,610
these policies and more importantly the

188
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,830
language which they're using and

189
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,270
mainstreaming it on media so the

190
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,550
gentlemen on your left is is Dan Stein

191
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,810
the gentleman on your right is Mark

192
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,770
Krikorian Dan Stein once literate said

193
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,750
that he believes that immigrants in this

194
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,510
country are engaging in competitive

195
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,690
breeding to dilute the white majority in

196
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,289
this country he is on c-span

197
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,870
now the gentleman on the right mark

198
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,970
Krikorian believes that haiti is a

199
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,200
messed up place because it wasn't

200
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
colonized long enough haiti is a messed

201
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,669
up place because they weren't colonized

202
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,950
long enough so these these say they have

203
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,179
now have the platform to have these

204
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,850
conversations and they're tapping back

205
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,220
into what's going on in the internet and

206
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,200
so i just want to take you

207
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,880
I'm pressing the wrong button so the

208
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,410
government's role here and this is

209
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,200
important they use these platforms to

210
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,579
mainstream this language like chain

211
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:03,100
migration I have one minute left

212
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,620
chain migration is the concept of family

213
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,149
reunification which is actually a very

214
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:12,010
normal thing then the New York Times and

215
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,589
The Washington Post cover it and this is

216
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:15,940
an important slide in the first half of

217
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,829
2016 the New York Times only sourced

218
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:20,140
these guys six times in the first half

219
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,589
of 2018 57 source stories The Washington

220
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:26,709
Post went from 11 source stories to 51

221
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,350
source stories these guys are everywhere

222
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,550
now they're on MB MSNBC they're on Fox

223
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,420
obviously and that has real-world

224
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,920
consequences these lies are legitimized

225
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,420
the dehumanizing language is

226
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,519
mainstreamed and there are real-world

227
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,339
consequences children are put into cages

228
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:47,620
American citizens are detained because

229
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,820
this stuff has been completely

230
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,610
normalized it's no longer fringe it's a

231
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,839
huge problem and and we need help too to

232
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,680
help our fellow citizens I look forward

233
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,290
to to your questions and comments

234
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:09,858
