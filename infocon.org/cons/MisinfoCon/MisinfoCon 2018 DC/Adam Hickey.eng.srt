1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
all right good morning everyone

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,710
thank you very much for the invitation

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,410
to speak today and for the very

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,000
important work that hacks and hackers

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,219
are doing and holding this conference

6
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,570
and thank you for attending and bringing

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,780
your expertise and experience to bear on

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,270
this problem it's a privilege for me to

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,859
kick off the morning session of the

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,500
state actor day of this conference and

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,850
to do that I'm going to give you an

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,350
overview of how the Department of

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,029
Justice use the problem of

14
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,949
misinformation I'm going to put it in

15
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,630
the context of some other related

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,520
national security threats and then

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,420
finally I want to tell you a little bit

18
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,829
about how we're trying to address it now

19
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,200
as Renee already referred to the

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,239
internet research agency you probably

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,530
know it's one of the entities that was

22
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,200
recently indicted earlier this year for

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,700
federal crimes in connection with an

24
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,800
effort to interfere with the last

25
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,020
presidential election the defendants

26
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,520
korneev indictment allegedly conducted

27
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,620
what they called information warfare

28
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,690
against the United States with the

29
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,309
stated goal of spreading distrust

30
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,320
towards the candidates and the political

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,960
system in general now according to the

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,090
indictment the IRA was a very structured

33
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,769
organization it had a management group

34
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,979
and was arranged in departments one of

35
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,299
those departments or the translator

36
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,490
project was designed specifically to

37
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,530
focus on the u.s. population and it had

38
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,920
more than 80 employees by July 2016 they

39
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,869
posed as politically and socially active

40
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,509
Americans advocating for and against

41
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,580
particular political candidates they

42
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,259
established social media pages and

43
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,909
groups to communicate with unwitting

44
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,710
Americans and they also purchased

45
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,600
political advertisements on social media

46
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,119
now one of the so-called trolls who

47
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,920
worked for the IRA but in a different

48
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,140
department focused on domestic Russian

49
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,000
propaganda recently spoke to the

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,220
Washington Post and he described his

51
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,229
experience working for the IRA as a

52
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,149
place where you have to write that white

53
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,549
is black and black is white hundreds of

54
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,680
people were all writing absolute

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,340
untruths but as the indictment alleges

56
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,680
what made the defendants conduct illegal

57
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,420
in the United States was not the

58
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,340
substance of their message or the

59
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,950
so-called accuracy of their opinions it

60
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,770
was their conspiracy to defraud among

61
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,329
other ways by lying about who the

62
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,699
messenger was they were not Americans

63
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,649
expressing their own viewpoints they

64
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,209
were Russians on the payroll of a

65
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,349
foreign company

66
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,260
now this problem of covert foreign

67
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,560
influence is not a new one in 1938 a

68
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,269
congressional committee found that the

69
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,040
Nazi government had established an

70
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,560
extensive underground propaganda

71
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,409
apparatus inside the United States using

72
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:31,230
American firms and citizens the response

73
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,389
was to recommend a law that would and

74
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,430
I'm quoting the committee now throw

75
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,469
those activities under the spotlight of

76
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,500
pitiless publicity the result of that

77
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,749
convention 'el investigation is what we

78
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,459
call the foreign agents Registration Act

79
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,030
a statute that what we call a disclosure

80
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,189
statute that notably does not prohibit

81
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:54,090
speech rather fairer requires agents of

82
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,439
foreign principals who engage in

83
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,299
political activities within the United

84
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:57,719
States

85
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,359
to file periodic public disclosures with

86
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:02,879
the Department of Justice the purpose of

87
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,709
the Act is to ensure that the American

88
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,409
public and policymakers know the source

89
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,359
of the information that's provided at

90
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,819
the behest of a foreign principle which

91
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,980
enhances our ability to evaluate the

92
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,010
information so transparency not

93
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,569
prohibition has been the government's

94
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,430
response to misinformation from abroad

95
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,459
in the 1980s the executive branch

96
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,079
established an interagency committee

97
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,030
known as the active measures working

98
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,949
group to counter Soviet disinformation

99
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,680
from that era it did so by exposing

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,290
forgeries and other propaganda such as

101
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,150
fake stories that the Pentagon developed

102
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,090
the AIDS virus as part of a biological

103
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,959
weapons program now today we confront

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,099
misinformation there's only one

105
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,470
component of a broader malign foreign

106
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,720
influence effort and am i right and

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,109
guessing this is okay so recently the

108
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,430
Department Justice put out a cyber

109
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,560
digital task force report the first

110
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,509
chapter of that deals entirely with

111
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,389
foreign malign influence operations and

112
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:03,569
as the report shows the type of

113
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:04,949
operations we're discussing today are

114
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,810
only one component of what a foreign

115
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,949
government might try to do they might

116
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,509
also try to break in to computer

117
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:11,219
networks right election systems or

118
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,459
campaigns they might try to Doc's to try

119
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,738
to hurt particular candidates they might

120
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:17,668
unwittingly

121
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,560
support unwitting Americans try to

122
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,710
organize rallies or they might more

123
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,169
transparently use state media to try to

124
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,540
influence the American

125
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,160
you're obviously not going to be able to

126
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,720
read the text on the screen but you can

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
see that chart in our report if you're

128
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,479
interested what it describes is how we

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,740
the Department in other parts of the

130
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,300
federal government try to counteract

131
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,729
each of those different efforts our

132
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,130
responses to foreign influence efforts

133
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,169
need to be multifaceted just like the

134
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,400
techniques that our adversaries are

135
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,710
using and they range from criminal

136
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,389
investigations and prosecutions to

137
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,669
sanctions and expulsion and other

138
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,080
efforts to raise the costs on the

139
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,060
activity so this graphic which you also

140
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,520
won't be able to read specifically

141
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,370
outlines what we our strategy for

142
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,830
countering foreign influence so content

143
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,449
based operation specifically and along

144
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,550
the top you'll see the different stages

145
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,440
of a maligned foreign influence campaign

146
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,600
that our adversaries might use that's in

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,240
red and then in blue below you'll see

148
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,370
the various ways we think we can counter

149
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,590
those efforts again this is online so if

150
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,080
you are interested reading it don't hurt

151
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,320
your eyes now so one aspect of this

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,820
strategy worth highlighting is that the

153
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,979
content of a foreign influence campaign

154
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,460
may be true or false I like what Rene

155
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,020
said which is that we shouldn't approach

156
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,090
this problem as a problem about truth

157
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,289
and fiction at least that's the

158
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,210
government's perspective whether the

159
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,039
message is accurate or not may not be

160
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,320
the point because boxing a candidate or

161
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,810
corporation for political reasons might

162
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,060
not involve misinformation but it may

163
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,520
nonetheless violate our laws threaten

164
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,220
our values and so forth by compromising

165
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,979
privacy retaliating and against and

166
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,789
therefore chilling free speech so covert

167
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:04,260
foreign influence efforts can take many

168
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,630
forms but recently we've seen increased

169
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,220
efforts to influence Americans through

170
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,740
social media so to counter those efforts

171
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,419
a key component of our approach at the

172
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,070
Justice Department is sharing

173
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,690
information with social media and other

174
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,789
Internet service providers which we do

175
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,830
through the FBI's foreign influence task

176
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,349
force its those providers who bear

177
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,690
responsibility for safeguarding the

178
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,729
security and privacy and proper use of

179
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:28,830
their platforms but by sharing

180
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,360
information with them about who their

181
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,820
users actually are who stands behind

182
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,219
them the account holders actually are we

183
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:37,380
can assist their own voluntary

184
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,300
initiatives to track foreign influence

185
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,750
active

186
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,960
and enforce their terms of service now

187
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,660
as the task force report also recognizes

188
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,520
there may be occasions where it's

189
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,290
appropriate for the government itself to

190
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,240
expose and attribute foreign influence

191
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,520
operations as a means of rendering them

192
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,500
less effective but there are often

193
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,850
compelling and countervailing

194
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,030
considerations first as a general rule

195
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,800
the the Justice Department does not

196
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,380
comment on confirm or deny pending

197
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,760
investigations and that's for a couple

198
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,670
reasons one to protect the investigation

199
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,730
itself and two to protect the rights of

200
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,320
any accused that they're maybe if they

201
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,169
investigation results in charges second

202
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,790
were constrained to protect the

203
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,650
classified sources and methods that may

204
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,090
inform our judgement about what a

205
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,520
foreign government is doing and third

206
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,980
and absolutely most important of all we

207
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,050
must never act in a way that confers an

208
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,669
advantage or disadvantage on any

209
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:32,280
political or social group organization

210
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,060
or individual

211
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,950
and we must strive to avoid even the

212
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,800
appearance of partiality so that could

213
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,020
constrain the timing and nature of any

214
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,720
disclosure we might make so all this is

215
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,090
to say and as the department's policy on

216
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,320
the disclosure of foreign influence

217
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,990
operations recognizes we the government

218
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,750
might not be the best messenger to

219
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,250
confront a particular piece of

220
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,560
misinformation that's why this

221
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,690
conference is so important what we in

222
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,370
the government call the private sector

223
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,990
but which includes a lot of people in

224
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,330
public spaces like you have a critical

225
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,830
role and I would say larger than the

226
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,810
federal government's encountering for

227
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,880
work over at foreign influence efforts

228
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,640
particularly misinformation and ensuring

229
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,919
that our democracy rests on the active

230
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,650
engagement of an informed public the

231
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,300
former Russian troll I mentioned at the

232
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,430
beginning of my remarks said that he

233
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,290
didn't think the work he was doing with

234
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,390
respect to domestic Russian propaganda

235
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,130
was worth the effort he called it

236
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,290
pointless said it wouldn't impact them

237
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,930
but in America he said he thought that

238
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,640
kind of trickery might have an impact

239
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,219
the reason being that we live in a

240
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,710
society in which it's quote accepted or

241
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,919
expected to answer for your words so my

242
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,839
challenge to us during this conference

243
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,880
if you'll let me make one is that we

244
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,370
find ways to ensure that we all continue

245
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,070
to answer for our words so that the

246
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,260
trust we enjoy is an aspect of a free

247
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,340
democracy

248
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,910
continues to thrive thanks

249
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,260
[Applause]
