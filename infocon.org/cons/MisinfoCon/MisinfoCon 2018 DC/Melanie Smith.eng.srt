1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
hi everyone I'm Melanie Smith I chose a

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,670
really bad day to leave my glasses at

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,010
home so I actually can't really read

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,190
anything on the slides hence why I'm

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,410
gonna be staring at my laptop a little

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,949
bit so apologies for that if I can

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:25,050
remember my password cool yeah um so

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,550
yeah thank you so much for inviting me

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,859
to speak I've actually taken a slightly

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,420
different approach to this I'm gonna

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,250
take a second while hopefully ten

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,910
minutes and no longer to talk about a

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,120
case study and a piece of research that

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,040
the company that I work for grafica has

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,719
been doing in a slightly different

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,270
context for disinformation so moving

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,440
away slightly from the electoral

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,920
interference studies and a bit more into

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,410
kind of humanitarian context so grafica

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,840
if anybody has heard of it put your hand

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,270
up if you have yeah that's way more than

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,910
I was expecting also be everyone knows

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,880
Camille so that's helpful I need to

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,170
change the slide okay again can't read

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,619
that but grafica is a social media

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,750
mapping and analysis firm always feels

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,909
like a bit of a dodgy thing to say but

28
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,090
we're good guys we promise we use

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,590
open-source data to map online

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,049
ecosystems and to create Network Maps

31
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,040
some of which I'm going to show you

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,630
there's two or three in the slide one of

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,710
which spins which I'm very excited about

34
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,090
we were lucky enough to collaborate with

35
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,920
the Syria campaign to provide analysis

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,200
on the online disinformation that

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,720
targets an organization called the white

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,500
helmets hands up for the White House

39
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,200
awesome that's really helpful to the

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,670
operation against them I'm sure most

41
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,140
people are aware of really ramped up

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,270
around the time that Russia entered the

43
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,290
conflict in Syria in 2015 and it became

44
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,509
obvious to many actors that were

45
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,860
involved that the white helmets were

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,320
documenting war crimes using the cameras

47
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,060
that they have on their helmets when

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,869
they go out to do rescues so for our

49
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,690
2017 report we took ten chronological

50
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,050
periods from across 2016 and 2017 that

51
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,890
were

52
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,930
pekes in conversation on twitter around

53
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,030
the white helmets to try and discern who

54
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,590
were the purveyors of disinformation in

55
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,630
this case who were the amplifiers and

56
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,340
what kind of narratives are they

57
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,590
spreading some of these are really

58
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,319
obvious peaks in conversations so

59
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,310
documentary about the white helmets was

60
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,100
nominated for an Oscar that obviously

61
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,330
created quite a big Twitter chatter the

62
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,850
Aleppo offensive and the Nobel Peace

63
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,650
Prize nomination that they received in

64
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,489
2017 so using the open Twitter API we

65
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,980
surfaced about 12 million tweets by

66
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,800
around 2.6 5 million accounts that

67
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,390
obviously is a huge amount of data to

68
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,220
try and put in a network map and you'll

69
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,120
see why in a minute

70
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,970
so we filtered that out by getting rid

71
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,860
of everybody that had mentioned or use

72
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,380
the hashtag white helmets less than 50

73
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,330
times which means that we ended up with

74
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,730
12,000 accounts in theory the most

75
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,890
interested and the most kind of obsessed

76
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,330
with the white helmets that we could

77
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,650
find and the maps that were created

78
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,950
looks like that they are they can be a

79
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,780
little bit tricky to read and I realized

80
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,430
that they're going to be even harder if

81
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,470
you can't see the labels on the slides

82
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,100
so hopefully I can help a bit it showed

83
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,260
significant overlap in followership and

84
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,329
interaction between a community that we

85
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,010
labeled so you have an automatic

86
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,480
labeling process that then goes through

87
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,540
human illness in that case it was me the

88
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,090
people in green we labeled as us left

89
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,100
and truthers a lot of this is

90
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,320
alternative media and kind of conspiracy

91
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,209
theories these people that they produce

92
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,400
them and be also share them and that

93
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,930
will be their kind of primary interest

94
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,060
cluster hence why they're colored the

95
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,730
way that they are so we saw significant

96
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,040
overlap between those people and the

97
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,230
little red / pink dots that you can see

98
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,230
in the corner there who were determined

99
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,140
to be Russia or Syrian regime support

100
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,360
accounts so they are people that either

101
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,430
affiliated with Kremlin or the Assad

102
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,709
regime officially so ministries

103
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,049
ambassador's official Twitter accounts

104
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:15,209
of kind of state apparatus all their

105
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,620
people that just push those agendas

106
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,620
really hard so that's kind of support in

107
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,770
however you can define it this means

108
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,500
that the u.s. left the green dots are

109
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,150
most likely to be reached by content

110
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,540
from

111
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,370
the red dots so what we're looking at

112
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,750
there is really an audience for

113
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,640
disinformation that's coming out of the

114
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,340
red accounts we also found that the

115
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,540
accounts that talked about the white

116
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,490
helmets most frequently were also the

117
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,650
most influential in the map so the

118
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,270
people putting out this information of

119
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,910
the most followed and the most listened

120
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,220
to on social media obviously that

121
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,220
creates quite a big problem content also

122
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,710
benefited from inorganic amplification

123
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,260
in many different ways we use 24-hour

124
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,780
tweet scheduling many different ways to

125
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,600
detect what we would determine to be

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,010
automatic amplification or BOTS like

127
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,960
behavior we estimated that over all this

128
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,940
information content pushed by the

129
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,240
accounts in this map reached around 56

130
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
million people so just to let that hang

131
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,340
for a sec specifically about the white

132
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,570
helmets - so we're talking about

133
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,960
something very small here content

134
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,520
analysis showed that unsurprisingly

135
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,990
information that was information that

136
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,960
was being put out by the rush of support

137
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,580
group was not only focused on smearing

138
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,380
the white helmets but also sewing wider

139
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,050
discontent so this was content and

140
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,080
narratives to do with New World Order

141
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,970
and support for Russian military action

142
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,690
in eastern Ukraine and in Crimea the

143
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,490
content originated with the people that

144
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,050
you would probably suspect

145
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,450
so Kremlin funded or owned media Assad

146
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,940
loyalists media but also independent

147
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,070
bloggers people like Vanessa B Lee and

148
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,950
mint press News who consistently put out

149
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,310
anti white helmets for one of a better

150
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,660
term propaganda so we repeat the

151
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,670
suspending one so we repeated this

152
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,460
exercise when there was a chemical

153
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,490
attack in Duma on April 7th we wanted to

154
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,290
see if the community of people listening

155
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,120
to this disinformation had changed and

156
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,650
where the narratives have been shifted

157
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,430
as a result specifically of this attack

158
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,340
so there was a new community involved

159
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,410
the UK left which you can see in pink

160
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,130
when they come back around that

161
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,820
emergence really also brought into bear

162
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,280
a lot of established European media

163
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,640
outlets we had people like

164
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,040
build the Telegraph The Times of London

165
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,780
and there were people that were putting

166
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,540
out content that was conspiratorial or

167
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,700
potentially false about the white

168
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,110
helmets so we're looking at a new

169
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,740
community abusers there there was also a

170
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,420
very interesting thing that happened

171
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,830
which I thought was a fluke in the data

172
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,490
collection

173
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,890
originally but a very large cluster of

174
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,950
Pink Floyd fans because Roger Walters

175
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,850
gave a very long tired a concert that he

176
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,680
did in Barcelona about the white helmets

177
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,270
specifically and about why we should

178
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,490
write them off as a terrorist group so

179
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,380
that ability to kind of game

180
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,720
disinformation is something that we saw

181
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,150
that was new for this map and really I

182
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,120
think is testament to the mainstreaming

183
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,360
that is that creates a huge problem for

184
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,880
countering disinformation when you get

185
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,620
an article from The Times that saying

186
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,450
we're not sure we're not sure who the

187
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,520
white helmets are funded by we think

188
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,590
they might have ties to terrorist groups

189
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,600
that's obviously a big problem and a big

190
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,470
audience to try and convince otherwise

191
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,840
we also did a little bit of comparative

192
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,630
analysis between various maps so

193
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,730
Amesbury in the UK and the screen pool

194
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,170
poisoning to slightly well I don't want

195
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,430
to say they're linked because appalling

196
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,040
they're not but two events that are kind

197
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,030
of standalone and for British political

198
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,430
debate are kind of where the

199
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,520
conversation around Russia currently is

200
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,020
the most popular hashtag among the

201
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,670
pro-russian people in this map was

202
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,950
hashtag white helmets which when this is

203
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,050
a map created around Amesbury seems like

204
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,600
a little bit of an oddity so we did a

205
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,340
little bit of comparative analysis which

206
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,240
showed that 40% of the accounts in our

207
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,370
map about the scrupled poisoning also

208
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,960
engaged with disinformation around

209
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,090
Amesbury and i think you can probably

210
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,220
see in the table i can't say it but i

211
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,200
hope it's there ninety two point six

212
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,570
percent of these total overlaps within

213
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,179
the anti West pro-russia group which

214
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,409
means that we've actually managed to

215
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,390
zero in on a network of disinformation

216
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,210
disinformation actors specifically

217
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,310
trying to push narratives around the

218
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,250
white helmets efforts to distort

219
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,230
disinformation around this attack

220
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,180
sort information I should say around

221
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,430
this attack also included Russian

222
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,240
embassies ministers and kind of broadly

223
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,180
state apparatus spreading false

224
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,920
narratives around the white helmets and

225
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,080
their affiliations last one well that's

226
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,620
really small by studying this

227
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,270
information that's leveled against one

228
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,670
group we are kind of hoping to show how

229
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,850
across multiple events rather than on an

230
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,970
electoral cycle cycle basis we were kind

231
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,830
of on a we were able to uncover a

232
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,080
different set of tactics and objectives

233
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,780
for disinformation and the mainstreaming

234
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,430
of these kind of conspiratorial and

235
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,680
false narratives by Kremlin affiliates

236
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,380
and state apparatus has very drastic

237
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,140
on-the-ground consequences for

238
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,100
humanitarian organizations like the

239
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,990
white helmets their centers get burnt

240
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,090
down there people get killed this is a

241
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,810
very real-world issue but it also

242
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,110
affects how communities around the world

243
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,670
understand the geopolitics of a certain

244
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,510
region so how populations in China the

245
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,880
US Australia conceptualize what's

246
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,440
happening in Syria and who the main

247
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,990
actors involved are so the objective of

248
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,520
this type of coordinated and sustained

249
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,650
disinformation is not about interference

250
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,630
in a singular democratic process but is

251
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,880
to undermine democracy as it

252
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,710
fundamentally stands this is about

253
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,540
protection of civilian populations and

254
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,490
trying to subvert those efforts

255
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,510
thank you

256
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:31,350
