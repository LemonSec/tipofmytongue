1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:06,319
hello I'm Tom and I heard talk about

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,639
critical thinking which is a phrase that

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,799
has come up today I'm glad to say I my

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,360
publishers presto a copy of my book into

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,710
my hand so I can wave it I've written a

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,880
book called critical thinking and

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,199
there's a few copies over there which

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,289
will be given away afterwards how

9
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:26,039
incredibly enticing I like the phrase

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,990
critical thinking we've been talking on

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,269
about media literacy skepticism and

12
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,910
engagement I wrote a book called

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,860
critical thinking and I work a lot

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,910
around it because for me at least it

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,789
suggests a rich way of exploring how we

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,399
are predictably prone to error how we

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,960
are vulnerable but also how together we

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,510
can develop modes of practice that allow

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,140
us to be better than of Honor abilities

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,850
and so it says ten commandments for

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,820
critical thinking and I suppose a way of

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,739
thinking about this is that I've through

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,799
my work it college-level

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,729
I'm trying to get the American

25
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,530
terminologies right college is what we

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,049
call school and yeah anyway so colleges

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,600
and universities and so on I'm

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,759
interested in trying to distill what you

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,549
might call sort of cognitive design

30
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,880
principles for helping people to think

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,610
better together and that together is

32
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,500
important there's been it's been

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,869
tremendously exciting to be here and

34
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,630
there's been a tremendous emphasis on

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,460
the interdisciplinary and systemic

36
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,259
nature of the problems and the solutions

37
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,930
there's not some magical solution that

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,360
solves everything there's not some evil

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,290
technology of someone who's causing the

40
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,530
problems these are symptomatic these are

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,750
emergent problems and so I think it's

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,720
quite exciting to frame positives in

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,909
terms of modes of practice principles

44
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,060
for design and I'm interested in framing

45
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,729
the cognitive context so please think of

46
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,950
this as a kind of distillation for me of

47
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,340
the cognitive context of the good things

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,459
we're trying to help people do and in

49
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,199
relationship to that the good things

50
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,569
that we believe people are capable of

51
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,260
and

52
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,480
the right circumstances under the right

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,890
incentives through the right

54
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,680
relationships you cannot afford in this

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,629
game to give up before you've started

56
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,959
cynicism is the seduction skepticism as

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,049
the solution if you will you can tell

58
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,370
I'm a philosopher because I have very

59
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,989
simple slides but they're in long things

60
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,739
to say about them I just think saying

61
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,480
slow down at the start is hugely

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,220
important for the very basic reason that

63
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,190
unless we slow down the moment we are

64
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,530
collectively and individually in an area

65
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,069
we don't have valid expertise around we

66
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,620
fall into error of various kinds because

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,650
we go with our gut we go with heuristics

68
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,019
we go with shortcuts we go with what is

69
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,660
most immediately available to us and

70
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,299
that is hugely problematic most of the

71
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,430
time as all sorts of things one can say

72
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,140
about this but given that I've got 10

73
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,940
minutes I'm going to move straight on to

74
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,670
number two which is this related idea of

75
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,950
the importance of conserving mental

76
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,440
energy and these two points go together

77
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,599
like I hope these are things that have

78
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,000
been kind of latent in so much of the

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,790
amazing stuff we've heard we have a

80
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,880
limited budget of attention and I've put

81
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,250
a vague aesthetic it's a pretty slide

82
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,919
but also because a casino is a very is a

83
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,049
devastatingly good analogy for the

84
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,230
monetization and repackaging and resale

85
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,389
of human attention that is one of the

86
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,480
great industries of our age the smartest

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,609
minds in a generation are being paid

88
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:46,440
very well to get you and your kids

89
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,290
clicking one more time revealing one

90
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,389
more preference and so on and I'm not

91
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,889
sure this can be said enough

92
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,209
foundationally because unless I feel

93
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,849
this is front of mind we may miss the

94
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:01,620
obvious fact that a lot of the good

95
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,129
stuff we're talking about is emergent

96
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,590
from qualities of time and attention

97
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,699
that are conducive to doing beyond the

98
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,000
obvious when we're talking about

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,228
fact-checking investigating thinking

100
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,358
twice the wonderful stuff from NPR about

101
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,728
young people sharing considered

102
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,280
perspectives if people are cognitively

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,280
depleted by the always connected devices

104
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,850
in that

105
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,870
pockets all the times that is a pretty

106
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,640
dystopian Huxley and as in all this

107
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,240
vision of everyday cognition it's a kind

108
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,610
of cognitive flattening it makes people

109
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,860
extraordinarily vulnerable to

110
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,200
manipulations of all stripes and I think

111
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,960
it's worth having this front of mind if

112
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,170
we cannot build certain qualities of

113
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,750
time and attention into people's lives

114
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,630
and systems then we cannot realistically

115
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,990
ask of them that they do more and of

116
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,890
ourselves

117
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,160
five minutes good god I'm gonna

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,110
I speak slow now I'm at a time I'm in a

119
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,540
time loop here if in doubt wait time is

120
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,660
an amazing filter again we lose track of

121
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,080
this we confuse urgency with rapidity

122
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,550
we're encouraged to do this there's a

123
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,820
structural recency bias embodied in our

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,250
technology and yet time is an amazing

125
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,860
filter we see so much noise rather than

126
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,010
signal this is a sort of the besetting

127
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,740
problem I think in that we are

128
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,690
discouraged and all kinds of structural

129
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,490
levels from waiting and it may mean that

130
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,650
we've the good people get terribly

131
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,960
excited about 15 things when we ought to

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,510
be focusing on one or two that have a

133
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,870
time span of years rather than minutes

134
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,280
know your limits as a man there

135
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,800
knowing your limits is the most basic

136
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,220
and powerful thing I think cognitively

137
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,990
not getting in the habit of saying I

138
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,360
don't know what do you think that is the

139
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,060
beginning of learning and we're terrible

140
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,889
at it and experts are doubly awful

141
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:04,210
because we can do an impression of a

142
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,849
confident person becoming comfortable

143
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,800
with your own limitations with that

144
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,539
phrase I don't know what do you think

145
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:14,910
what is out there that is at the root of

146
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,240
robustness but where some costs f-35

147
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,940
there 1.5 trillion lifetime costs plenty

148
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,900
of sunk costs snares for the brain you

149
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,120
put effort into something and you become

150
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,820
shackled to it emotionally being able to

151
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,800
let go this is my kind of Whistlestop

152
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,800
tour of 10 cognitive points our

153
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,620
inability to let go of stuff that we put

154
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,930
a lot of energy into can be a huge

155
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,789
obstacle to focusing upon things that

156
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:43,750
will have the most impact and

157
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,349
productivity

158
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:46,479
it's got a general lifetime tip these

159
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,860
are this is these are kind of life hacks

160
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,389
I guess with you know with with sort of

161
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,530
academic pretensions what you see is

162
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,259
never all there is I'm kind of stealing

163
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:00,070
this from Danny Kahneman it's very

164
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,750
obvious and very difficult I love the

165
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,210
famous story about planes in the Second

166
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,639
World War because it's true that planes

167
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,590
were coming back and they looked at them

168
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,900
and said where should we armor our

169
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,419
planes to stop them being shot down and

170
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:15,280
they said well they're full of holes

171
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,810
here and here so this is we're going to

172
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,849
put some armor and about at that point

173
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,590
my grandfather was shot down to put in a

174
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,419
prisoner of war camp and they're just

175
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:24,699
afterwards someone said no we need to

176
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,039
armor them where there are no holes at

177
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,800
all because these are the places that if

178
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,050
you're shot even once you never make it

179
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,650
back

180
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,699
we are often blind to the failures that

181
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,419
are the definition of whether something

182
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,759
lives or dies well something succeeds or

183
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,219
fails to surface the invisible failures

184
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:47,590
is I think one of the great cognitive

185
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,199
and research tasks to not just look at

186
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,659
the handful of lucky survivors and it's

187
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:55,870
extraordinarily difficult recency and

188
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,310
relevance I put this slide in because

189
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,849
the famous stat that 90% of the world

190
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,889
data was created in the last two years

191
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,559
this is not only true it has been true

192
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,749
every year for the last thirty years

193
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:10,509
and I think this is just an absolutely

194
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:12,039
shocking piece of information when we

195
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,899
get excited about big data because what

196
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,899
it means in part is that every time we

197
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,399
come up with a sort of data rich

198
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,080
analysis of what is going on in the

199
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,839
world you go back about 10 years and

200
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,599
you've basically got no data you have to

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,429
make allowances for the massive

202
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:30,009
structural recency bias of the digital

203
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,099
world you very very hard to take the

204
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:34,870
long view the present is screaming at us

205
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,328
it's screaming crisis and I think we can

206
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:38,860
all get sometimes a little bit

207
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,490
apocalyptic about this and this leads me

208
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,029
rapidly to this very basic point I get a

209
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,069
bit obsessed with popper karl popper

210
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,860
because he was a good guy but also

211
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,990
because he made the fundamental point

212
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,440
that there is a deep asymmetry between

213
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,540
confirmation and a refutation we can

214
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,190
endlessly confirm something we would

215
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,990
like to be true whether it's that the

216
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,850
earth is flat the moon landings didn't

217
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,040
happen or that Alex Jones is a great

218
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,519
person and our knowledge will never

219
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,610
possess certainty but we can if we can

220
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,889
refute something we do have certainty by

221
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,930
abandoning a false view and this is a

222
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,880
very easy thing to say in a very hard

223
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,850
thing to do and in order to do it we

224
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,740
need to pick our own frames of reference

225
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,910
we need to be able to recontextualize

226
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,370
things we've seen this brilliant

227
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,660
illustrated in the videos the

228
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,949
photographs the evidence I've been

229
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,380
frantically tweeting about and yet the

230
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,660
point about frames the fundamental point

231
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,870
is that if we act fast were only ever

232
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,880
reacting to the framing someone gives us

233
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,949
and so this is the final point every

234
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:47,110
option can be wrong in fact it almost

235
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,380
always is the drop down menu is the kind

236
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,569
of evil emblem of this in our lives

237
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:57,310
every option is often wrong and of and

238
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,709
the best option is almost never on

239
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,509
display you know you've got to write the

240
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:03,759
menu from scratch so to speak and I

241
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,649
think this is a very difficult thing to

242
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,449
pursue but a very worthwhile one so I'm

243
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:08,829
going to stick this quote from Jonathan

244
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:12,329
Swift up famously Irish and cynical

245
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:13,850
because

246
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,970
I say all this stuff we do all this

247
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,709
stuff and yet we sort of know that

248
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:24,019
taking the fact check to the enemy won't

249
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,709
changed minds and I believe this is

250
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,740
partly because what changes people's

251
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,360
minds is the communities the practices

252
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
the store is the way they live the

253
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,100
texture of their daily life and we have

254
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,259
to be very humble in the face of the

255
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,509
extraordinary malleability of the human

256
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:45,949
mind we mustn't make the mistake of

257
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,769
assuming that the way we act in facebook

258
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:50,569
groups today is some deep truth about

259
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:52,759
human nature it's not we're poured into

260
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,170
that particular mold and certain

261
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,079
outcomes emerge and I think to find

262
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,339
productive compelling emotive empathetic

263
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:02,930
modes of engagement with people we would

264
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,380
like to label our enemies to find common

265
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,810
causes to pour ourselves into other

266
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,709
molds

267
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,389
whether these are the spaces left by

268
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,269
shared religion by social practice by

269
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:15,920
notions of the sacred by notions of the

270
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,500
family as smartypants people we

271
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,810
shouldn't be scared to talk this

272
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,759
language and go into these spaces and

273
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,630
pour our beliefs into these communal

274
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,269
molds because we are not going to change

275
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:31,279
people's minds by telling them that they

276
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,280
are wrong and we're right

277
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:43,699
[Applause]
