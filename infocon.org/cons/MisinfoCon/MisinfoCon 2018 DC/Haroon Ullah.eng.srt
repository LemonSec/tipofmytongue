1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,170
how's everyone doing I'm excited to be

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,819
here now I have to say right at the

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,330
beginning who's heard of BBG honest show

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,980
of hands okay wow it's a lot more than

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,639
usual

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,440
all right so broadcasting Board of

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,630
Governors really honored to be with you

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,550
kind of hand in hand to talk about such

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,070
an important subject and you know I want

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,619
to open with what I think of is you know

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:23,910
one of the greatest misinformation

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,130
disinformation warriors for the past

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,300
century Nelson Mandela

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,489
he said that leadership is a choice and

15
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,350
I believe that our storytellers our

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,420
journalists that take on that ethos

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,309
every day with you hand in hand are out

18
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,170
there sort of on the front lines

19
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,120
courageous and oftentimes putting their

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,160
lives on the line to show that kind of

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,739
leadership so as part of brockington

22
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,420
board of governors we're in 58 languages

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,640
as you know it's Voice of America Radio

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,460
Free Asia ready for Europe off of Cuba

25
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,360
broadcasts a Middle East Broadcasting

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,420
Network and we're out there sort of as I

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,730
said trying to understand this challenge

28
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,250
so I want to talk a little bit about

29
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,840
what I think of are the sort of main

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,129
disinformation challenges what we're

31
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,260
seeing in terms of the research and then

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,490
talk a little bit about what we're doing

33
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,439
so what are we seeing out there in the

34
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,840
research one is that we're seeing that

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,000
state-sponsored disinformation they live

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,909
by this mantra and the mantra is the

37
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,060
following the narrower the audience the

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,070
bigger the impact alright so there's a

39
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,570
lot of work that we're funny

40
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,369
state-sponsored disinformation actors

41
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,080
are putting in to audience segmentation

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,140
and and what we find of is that this

43
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,030
sort of this gets into sort of the media

44
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,710
literacy question which I want to tackle

45
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,810
here today and to thinking a little bit

46
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,040
about how do they target those audiences

47
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,570
all right I'm gonna figure this out all

48
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,970
right so we have basically you know if

49
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,189
you look at media literacy we find

50
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,840
pretty strong correlation and I would

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,390
make the case some causation where you

52
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,640
find low media literacy in certain

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,430
communities which makes them which does

54
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,360
not make them resilient to

55
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,590
disinformation so we've done some

56
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,790
studies on this but I can talk about

57
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,920
offline but we find in countries where

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,530
there's low media literacy places like

59
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:07,979
Italy

60
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,169
places like Romania that actually you

61
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,959
find that where information travels

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,740
further in

63
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,930
the disinformation misinformation that

64
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,360
you that you actually have citizens are

65
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,190
unable to sort of cut through that noise

66
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,300
okay

67
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,600
the other thing is sort of is that when

68
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,930
we think about disinformation the other

69
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,430
piece of this is sort of we all we

70
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,900
oftentimes talk about the Kremlin

71
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,540
PlayBook state-sponsored playbook of

72
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,480
what the Russians are doing and what we

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,950
find in terms of the content and

74
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,530
distribution in Russian language is that

75
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,150
they I think what often times gets

76
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,620
ignored is if they have a hyperlocal

77
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,020
strategy what I'd be a hyperlocal

78
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,940
strategy it's that they actually are

79
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,830
oftentimes a lot of their disinformation

80
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,020
misinformation is on local hyperlocal

81
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,460
stories in municipalities in towns right

82
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,650
which a lot of times big bigger media

83
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,200
news agencies don't cover right and

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,510
again they think carefully about who the

85
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,800
audience is what are the vulnerable

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,540
groups that they're trying to target

87
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,310
what are the groups they're really sort

88
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,690
of trying to reach with this

89
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,640
disinformation and again we spoke we

90
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,170
focus a lot on the Kremlin sort of

91
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,060
Kremlin sponsored but if I was just to

92
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,630
say the top ten languages give me some

93
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,090
examples top ten languages of where we

94
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,860
have increasing trends of disinformation

95
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,100
state-sponsored disinformation tell me

96
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,900
what's that Spanish okay yes what else

97
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,160
Russian we wanted something else on

98
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,120
Russian I'm trying to get some other

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,550
languages Turkish yeah yep Mandarin yeah

100
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,660
there's a couple more I want people to

101
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,090
mention they haven't mentioned yet Tamil

102
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,890
not in the top ten but but he's getting

103
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,720
increasingly what's it Arabic yeah

104
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,210
Arabic what's that - golly someone said

105
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,680
yes Farsi

106
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,320
yes Farsi and a couple that you haven't

107
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,240
mentioned which again I want to sort of

108
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,130
dimensions because we over the next I

109
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,990
think two days can talk about this row

110
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:03,570
hang uh Weger okay or do all right we

111
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,910
mentioned Farsi now a lot of these are

112
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,540
smaller languages right niche languages

113
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,910
not huge but we what we finding is that

114
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,680
more more state-sponsored to realize

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
again these narrow audiences is

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,220
segmented audiences they're realizing

117
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,019
you know and we obviously operate a lot

118
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,040
of those languages a lot of our

119
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,770
journalists are in jail we got a lot of

120
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,940
our weaker journalists or families been

121
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,090
put in jail in China because they are

122
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,320
tackling this everyday the other thing I

123
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,760
want to sort of get out is it sort of

124
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,370
again insert the challenges we have the

125
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,930
media literacy issue which are trying to

126
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,550
tackle we have content and distribution

127
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,900
which I mentioned in terms of the

128
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,760
Kremlin state sponsored every state

129
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,729
sponsored kind of has its own playbook

130
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,840
there's things you can look at it in

131
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,669
terms of backfire effect or sort of in

132
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,380
terms of again in terms of how they're

133
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,520
trying to get across information

134
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,380
the third is sort of in terms of

135
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,790
censorship right we'll talk a lot about

136
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,770
censorship and the new tools that

137
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,500
state-sponsored actors are using to make

138
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,050
sure that that citizens can't access

139
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,270
information now we operate on all three

140
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,300
at BBG across all of our network our

141
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,830
journalists who are on the front lines

142
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,570
and I really do think of this as a I

143
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,160
would say an information battlefield

144
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,229
because there's no borders on this on

145
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,200
this arena as many of us know so we're

146
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,850
trying to tackle all three and I would

147
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,229
make the case that we're doing something

148
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,740
I think that is quite innovative so one

149
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,090
thing that we've launched that's become

150
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,380
increasingly popular something called

151
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,510
polygraph so Polly if anyone heard of

152
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,030
heard of polygraph all right not enough

153
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,440
people but we're gonna increase that

154
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,900
over the next few days so polygraph and

155
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,580
it's it's it's sort of cousin factor

156
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,289
graph it's looking at the Russian

157
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,750
language media space and essentially

158
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,240
it's scoring sort of Russian language

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
media right not quite a rotten tomatos

160
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,950
for news but it's but it's basically

161
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,870
trying to sort of say look here's a

162
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,940
story is it partially true is it

163
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,160
misleading what is it about this what is

164
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,500
the sourcing on this story and we found

165
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,110
incredible kind of responsiveness to

166
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,840
this okay we found that actually we've

167
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,910
had month-on-month increasing number of

168
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,010
visitors and not just folks that are

169
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,120
russian language speaking we've had

170
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,370
other language markets that are tapping

171
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,780
into this to see if they can find it in

172
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,349
their language

173
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,960
right it's become a helpful tool and

174
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,789
we've seen the demand again continue to

175
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,370
increase and we found actually that a

176
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,260
lot of the Russian language media is now

177
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,580
trying to respond to us

178
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,200
there's backlash from the RTS and the

179
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,090
sputnik's right in terms of now how

180
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,560
they're covering how we're covering

181
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,630
their stories because in some ways we

182
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,220
can also drive people towards our

183
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,740
content so we actually want to take this

184
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,970
and hopefully in the workshops we'll

185
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,830
talk about it today but we actually want

186
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,690
to take this and scale it up across

187
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,030
eight languages and ideally if you ask

188
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,220
me our vision over the next

189
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,260
here in the next few years is we like to

190
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,000
do it over fifty or fifty eight

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
languages because in a lot again in a

192
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,870
lot of smaller languages this is where

193
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,030
we have a competitive advantage where

194
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,860
yet it's not yet commercial but we can

195
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,870
actually make the case and provide an

196
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,870
increased media literacy the other big

197
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,750
piece of what we do is on circumvention

198
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,080
and so as many of you might know we

199
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,860
sponsor tools like siphon through the

200
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,870
office of Internet freedom we also have

201
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,190
the open Technology Fund that's also

202
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,560
part of the BBG family which is

203
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,620
basically we're trying to reach folks

204
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,510
and as state sponsored get more

205
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,790
sophisticated and using tools and

206
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,740
figuring out surveillance they're

207
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,780
actually cracking down so for example

208
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,300
this past spring during the Iran protest

209
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,190
the height of the protests right Iran

210
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,710
Iranian sponsor irani and telecom

211
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,110
providers were out there trying to sort

212
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,419
of shut down the ability for you know

213
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:36,770
ordinary citizens to get their voices

214
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,169
out we had about 800,000 people per day

215
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,300
accessing our technology at the height

216
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,040
of the protests and we've seen those

217
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,690
numbers continue to spike not just

218
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,730
Mandarin speakers but farsi speakers or

219
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,570
do language speakers in cambodia in all

220
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,100
over we're seeing this sort of the rise

221
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,450
in this and so we're trying to look for

222
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,970
new tools that we can provide to folks

223
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,370
and think about new ways to empower our

224
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,440
our citizen journalists and again a lot

225
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,700
of the surveillance tools are getting

226
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,010
more sophisticated that actually you

227
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,990
know a lot of journalists are going

228
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,370
missing a lot of them arvind times

229
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,810
putting their life on the line so we're

230
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,040
trying to think about how do we keep

231
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,540
ahead of that curve how do we actually

232
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,669
have a tool that can get out to people

233
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:17,840
that can use it that's accessible

234
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,040
because a lot of technology out there

235
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,050
but it's almost too sophisticated to

236
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,550
sort of scale it up so on all three of

237
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,630
these dimensions again as I mentioned

238
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,669
media literacy both in terms of

239
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,260
trainings in terms of our independent

240
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,659
fact-based reporting in terms of what we

241
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,250
talked about here in terms of the

242
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,380
content in terms of getting our stories

243
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,900
out and we'll talk a little bit later

244
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,280
hopefully in the workshops about some of

245
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,469
the AI and machine learning tools that

246
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:43,940
are being used to sort of accompanying a

247
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,560
voice of China does anyone know the

248
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,050
voice of China right just announced Xi

249
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,560
Jinping's legacy in this information

250
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,600
statecraft battle it's gonna be the

251
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,050
largest

252
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,790
public broadcaster in the world that

253
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,899
he's going to be doing over a dozen

254
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,519
languages and it's a conglomerate of all

255
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,560
the state-sponsored TV and radio so

256
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,880
they're gonna be gonna continue to get

257
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,050
involved it but everybody's putting

258
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,450
investments in that lastly I have a

259
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,070
fantastic team and I want you to meet

260

[Applause]
