1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,310
good morning I'm glad to be here and

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,450
super glad to be part of this tribe that

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,519
has been meeting periodically the

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,580
misinformation tribe of folks who are

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,580
trying to do stuff about it it's it's a

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,039
wonderful group and I see a big green

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,609
button I assume that means go forward

8
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:26,039
I'm here to talk about something that's

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,289
come up a few times and that's the

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,980
demand side we spent a lot of time in

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,719
this world thinking about better supply

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,450
we God knows we need better supply of

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,190
information of journalism etc but I'm

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,840
quite sure we need to improve demand

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,399
equally it's what I've been working on

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,730
for a while now to summarize the last

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,079
couple of days this stuff is not new and

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,949
it slides out of it's not showing right

19
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,329
but we have a disinformation

20
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,670
surveillance industrial complex that has

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,270
risen that is really new and that it's

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,560
going to get a lot worse these are not

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,950
these are not showing in full whatever

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,180
but this is going to get worse you heard

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,700
about deep fakes and it's a real thing

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,560
and we're were in some trouble but I

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,420
think we're going to see our way through

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,630
it we can't just the upgrade supply we

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,080
got to upgrade us and that's all of us

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,619
and I want to say that I love calling

31
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,310
 by the way and I think that we

32
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,640
should remember as you just heard we all

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,670
get fooled to at least once a year I

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,380
share something that turns out to have

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,619
been wrong and I'm more careful than I

36
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,840
used to be by far but it still happens

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,850
no matter how much time we spend in this

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,210
we're all susceptible to the problem and

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,670
that media news literacy these are terms

40
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,560
that are debatable news awareness news

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,479
fluency some of the words people are

42
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,110
using but we have to work on that and

43
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,330
there are lots of definitions ones

44
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,300
subsets of others etc but we do need

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,140
to focus on the work that we're doing

46
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,580
and I've been doing a teacher course in

47
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,530
this and have for a while and did a MOOC

48
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,740
on it offering ideas principles for

49
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,260
consumers these are pretty obvious ones

50
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,540
and that the creators who are now

51
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,570
consumers and everyone doing both we

52
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,060
need to focus on lots of new principles

53
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,580
in people who want to be taken seriously

54
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,310
I think need to add transparency as a

55
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,130
principal that has not been particularly

56
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,510
a journalistic one and hopefully will be

57
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,980
now whose were going to be responsible

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,110
for doing this state legislatures are

59
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,970
starting to wake up to this there's not

60
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,670
enough of them doing it but there's

61
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,380
certainly no impetus at the federal

62
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,730
government to teach critical thinking

63
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,000
which is at the heart of this who how

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,620
are we going to make this stuff scale

65
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,350
that's the question I keep asking we got

66
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,000
to do it and we got to do it at scale

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,400
there are a number of ways one is to get

68
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,740
into education libraries in a more

69
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,080
comprehensive way at the moment these

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,830
are one-offs for the most part they're

71
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,080
good ones we want to do more but we need

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,140
them a lot more focus on it and we can

73
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,790
do a great deal more sorry about these

74
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,090
slides news organizations media

75
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,160
organizations are a place we can get

76
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,320
scale for reasons that completely

77
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,709
baffled me journalists did not make this

78
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,040
part of their mission fifty years ago I

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,360
think if they had we'd be in a little

80
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,070
bit less trouble than we are today

81
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,130
back when they had more reach back when

82
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,930
they had more money back when they had

83
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,680
more reason to do it they didn't we're

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,360
working on some things to help them do

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,310
it because there's still some scale in

86
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,910
journalism and the technology industry

87
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,940
is core to figuring this out because

88
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,880
they define scale at this point and

89
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,950
there are some promising things

90
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,610
happening

91
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,980
not nearly enough but I think we have

92
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,760
some potential there all of these

93
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,890
parties have to be part of something

94
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,830
that's collaborative and we hope that

95
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,410
that's going to happen and it's kind of

96
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,740
what we're working

97
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,380
in our it's very new this news collab at

98
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,160
ASU to try and focus from largely from

99
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,070
the demand side on how we can with

100
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,920
partners elevate the best stuff going on

101
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,930
in this do experiments with various

102
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,260
partners and others and see what we can

103
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,020
make happen and some things are starting

104
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,360
to work one of the things we did early

105
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,590
on was to go relentlessly looking for

106
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,900
stuff where there was evidence a that it

107
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,900
was interesting be that it worked that

108
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,520
there was some information some data

109
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,380
some evidence that something good

110
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,630
happened as a result there are a million

111
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,490
good experience going on around the

112
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,190
world in these work areas of

113
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,770
transparency engagement education and

114
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,700
etc but what are the ones that work so

115
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,330
we compiled best practices and again the

116
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,430
that we think of it as kind of a

117
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,560
cookbook of things that have evidence

118
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,320
showing that there's some effectiveness

119
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,950
of it and we add how you can do it

120
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,440
and we're presented this to some editors

121
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,630
that we're working with in various

122
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,250
places one of our pilot projects is to

123
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,710
work locally with some newsrooms and

124
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,470
locally is really interesting this is a

125
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,560
survey that Christy rashke our managing

126
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,950
director led working on surveyed about

127
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,280
6,000 people around the country and

128
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
really interesting thing happened if you

129
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,780
ask this was a word association so we

130
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,790
said what's the first thing comes to

131
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,170
mind when you hear news well it was fake

132
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,150
about 20% a pretty awful number but when

133
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,760
we said what do you associate when you

134
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,980
hear local news what's the first thing

135
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,790
that comes to mind

136
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,820
fake almost disappeared not completely

137
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,450
but something a bunch of words that we

138
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,640
collected into something called my place

139
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,040
my town that was the first response

140
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,760
overwhelmingly we think that's good news

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,520
we think that's an opportunity the

142
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,530
worrisome part in there will always be

143
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,870
one is that the people who want to

144
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,009
discredit real journalism are

145
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,289
now going local and they're doing it

146
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:45,050
with some success we're working with

147
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,039
newsrooms three McClatchy newsrooms in

148
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,330
Macon Georgia Kansas City and Fresno and

149
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,009
with Cronkite news which is the news arm

150
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,610
of Arizona Public Broadcasting which the

151
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,550
Cronkite School owns and operates and

152
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,860
we're working on experiments with

153
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,649
partners people like harken spaceship

154
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,089
media a whole bunch of really great

155
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:11,770
folks to see things we can do to

156
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,270
experiment and try things that are

157
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,990
working so in Kansas City were one of

158
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,779
our focuses is transparency as well as

159
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,210
engagement and little things are being

160
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,939
added it took a long time for news the

161
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:29,689
traditional news industry to do BIOS on

162
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:32,149
stories while that's coming where we

163
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,620
think that's a good thing you know

164
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,159
telling him who you are helps where

165
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,050
they're having meetings collaborating

166
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,610
with the local library on a couple of

167
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,619
projects libraries have a tremendous

168
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:43,610
amount of credibility

169
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,479
this is a good pairing and finding out

170
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:51,229
what the communities want we're talking

171
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,300
about the journalism how they did it why

172
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,249
they did it what happened when they did

173
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,949
it this is vital into the transparency

174
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,509
you know there's much more going on with

175
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,169
them and with Fresno and Macon and

176
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,360
Cronkite news but a flavor of some of

177
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,680
the experiments were doing

178
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,899
we're also on a project that's just

179
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,969
launching to talk about science and

180
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,909
health we think that news literacy

181
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,209
should be not necessarily a topic of its

182
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:20,059
own but rather embedded into other

183
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,339
things and science and health is the

184
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:25,159
first place we're working on a grant to

185
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,680
see if we can make modules and do that

186
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,269
so we can embed it into lots of other

187
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:33,198
stuff another thing we are vitally

188
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:35,870
interested in is this place where supply

189
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,529
and demand meet sharing how do we deal

190
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,958
with people constantly sharing stuff

191
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,789
that's wrong how do we help them

192
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,860
understand how to do it better there

193
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,290
some project one in Asia we're looking

194
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,360
at closely called share with care and

195
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,790
we're going to see what we can

196
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,640
come up with this is also quite new but

197
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,460
we really need collaboration across all

198
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,220
the boundaries and I hope that some of

199
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,560
you at some of the people here are our

200
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,870
partners some of the I hope that more of

201
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,140
you will be over time this has got to

202
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,800
happen across all borders and ideologies

203
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,540
and everything or we're just not going

204
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,380
to make it work so I hope that you'll

205
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,190
ping me about ideas you have the really

206
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,190
important thing for us is that the news

207
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,680
collab it's news collab or we don't do

208
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,260
we don't copy things that people do and

209
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,150
do it ourselves if they're if they're

210
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,450
good we help them do more of it we want

211
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,520
to only experiment try new things where

212
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,170
others aren't doing it so we want to

213
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,450
help you do things and promote the good

214
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,610
stuff you're already doing thanks very

215
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:54,260
much thank you thank you Dan that was

216
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,530
great
