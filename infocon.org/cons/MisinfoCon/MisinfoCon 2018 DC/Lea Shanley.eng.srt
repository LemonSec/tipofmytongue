1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,480
hi my name is Lea Shanley as Dwight

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,339
mentioned I'm the co-executive director

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,429
of the South big data innovation hub for

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,099
those of you who may not be familiar the

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,049
big data innovation hubs were funded by

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,500
the National Science Foundation in 2015

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,789
there are four such hubs around the

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,980
country so you all are probably near one

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,529
of the hubs we are based at universities

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,289
and our role is to catalyze and

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,630
strengthen partnerships that connect

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,810
academic researchers industry government

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,450
and NGOs to apply data science and

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,640
analytics to social and scientific

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,899
challenges so I came to the

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,780
misinformation space back in 2011 when I

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,850
ran a lab called the Commons lab at the

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,100
Woodrow Wilson Center here in DC and we

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,600
were working to connect digital

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,149
volunteer groups who were beginning to

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,309
use social media to respond to disasters

22
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,910
like the Haiti earthquake with academic

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,160
researchers and with government to begin

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,170
to develop sets of best practices and

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,719
standards and to build trust within the

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,099
federal government for using these

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,040
approaches now through the hub well I

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
should back up at that time we tried to

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
raise awareness with policy makers and

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,060
we briefed Robert Muller we book brief

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,580
then post 9/11 Commission but by and

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,250
large policy makers were kind of deaf to

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,799
these challenges now they're aware and I

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,670
think the challenge will be

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,460
communicating how the research can can

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,500
result in action and get the

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,579
policymakers to understand so today

38
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,009
through the hub I now work with the

39
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,259
research community that spans many

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,960
disciplines so like academics like to do

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
they have given it a name from social

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,420
cybersecurity to cognitive security and

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,100
I bet there several other terms that are

44
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,799
in use but social cybersecurity is an

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,869
emerging academic discipline that works

46
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,360
to assess understand predict and

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,299
mitigate attempts by actors such as

48
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,909
terrorist groups to use media platforms

49
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,829
to recruit members coordinate activities

50
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,560
and influence the cognitive biases of

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,899
large groups of individuals for social

52
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,239
political or economic consequences

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,920
things that you guys have all been

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,010
talking about what I'm finding

55
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,020
fascinating and I'm sorry if this font a

56
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,239
little small for you to read but social

57
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,180
cybersecurity is an inherently

58
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,840
multidisciplinary and multi

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,209
methodological computational social

60
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,150
science the blends computer science and

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,370
data science as phil has discussed with

62
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,370
political science sociology

63
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,270

decision science social psychology and I

67
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,709
hope I'm not leaving out any others so

68
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,810
we are a diverse community our

69
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,730
researchers in this area are applying a

70
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,709
variety of methods and in the data

71
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,390
science space that includes network

72
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,430
analysis and visualization language

73
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,790
technologies data mining statistics and

74
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,180
so forth colleagues of mine

75
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,100
Kathleen Carly at Carnegie Mellon

76
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,160
University and in Argo Wall and others

77
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,019
began to look at how this field is

78
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,810
emerging in the academic space and they

79
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,019
have demonstrated that we are seeing a

80
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,819
dramatic increase in peer-reviewed

81
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,940
articles book chapters of conference

82
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,459
proceedings in this space but was it

83
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,519
what was a surprise perhaps is when they

84
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,280
did a network analysis is that not all

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,690
these researchers are connected to each

86
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,720
other so that they found out of the

87
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,150
third thirteen hundred and fifty-six

88
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,070
researchers who were publishing in this

89
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,480
space as of I think early last year only

90
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,390
three hundred work really connected

91
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,370
collaborating with each other writing

92
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,410
papers with each other the other

93
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,480
thousand are working in onesies and

94
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,609
twosies

95
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:56,040
so as the South hub which our role is to

96
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,829
serve as connective tissue how can we

97
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,989
begin to connect people across these

98
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,090
disciplines to connect data science with

99
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,940
the social science so we set up a

100
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,530
working group which we mentioned there's

101
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,209
long title work for the working group

102
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,430
but that social cybersecurity finding is

103
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,130
more palatable with the policy community

104
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,410
we now have about 50 researchers in this

105
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,769
space we meet monthly or virtually to

106
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,440
share the research that we're doing to

107
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,380
exchange ideas begin to think about best

108
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,520
practices in March I find

109
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,470
a workshop to bring these folks together

110
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,229
at carnegie mellon and we began to scope

111
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,849
out what would a collaborative research

112
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:36,849
platform look like links to data links

113
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:41,889
to experts tools resources etc something

114
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,930
that would raise all boats in the

115
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,349
research space we also are beginning to

116
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,419
think about what the research agenda is

117
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,879
where the priority areas that could

118
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,650
inform NSF and other funding

119
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,289
institutions in this space and I would

120
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,180
ask to become up here so that I can

121
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,479
invite you all I heard so many fantastic

122
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:03,340
talks today organizations who are

123
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,530
already building communities perhaps we

124
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,090
can form a consortium or if you'd like

125
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,180
to join our group please give us a ring

126
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,490
thank you thank you

127
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,620
Thank You Mia okay we're gonna we're

128
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,610
running a little behind we're gonna go

129
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,940
streaming
