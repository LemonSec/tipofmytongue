1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,100
well first well this is getting set up I

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,300
want to thank Dwight and others for

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,480
organizing this this great event so we

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,550
all sort of know that we're drowning in

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,000
in we know our information

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,280
environments or instance insincere and

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,740
and unreliable but I want to talk about

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,199
two kinds of that I think

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,480
exists so there's the old school

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,279
 and there's new school

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,779
it's kind of how I break it out and I'll

12
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,220
sort of end like this a little bit

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,869
I'll start pretty easy so I live in

14
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,460
Seattle we have tons of startups and I

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,630
go and listen to some of these startups

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,520
on our campus and I saw this statement

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,680
our collective mission is to refund lies

18
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,630
customer driven solutions for leveraging

19
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,820
underutilized portfolio opportunities I

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,590
hear this guy suppose that there might

21
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,719
be some meaning in there but I am still

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,480
still still wondering it's this new kind

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,520
of BS that I'm worried about and it's

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,050
the kind that I think students struggle

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,399
with and I think that public in general

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,350
well short of statistical significance

27
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,750
after bonferroni correction bla bla bla

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,690
somehow the second statement seems more

29
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,469
truthy it seems to carry more weight and

30
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,270
it's you know more studies are coming

31
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,409
out I don't think we even need the

32
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,970
studies to show this was a recent study

33
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,040
out of Dartmouth showing that charts can

34
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,990
change hearts and minds but they can

35
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,939
also mislead as well let me give you an

36
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,250
example so it's--it ista is a place that

37
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,540
aggregates data they don't really have

38
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,830
any left leaning or right leaning

39
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,350
agendas and they saw this a chart not

40
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,299
too long ago it was looking at the sort

41
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,460
of leveling off of carbon emissions from

42
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,740
global fossil fuel you can't see it

43
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,970
because it's small enough but there was

44
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,670
this weird change in the in the x-axis

45
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,189
it goes jumps in 30-year increments and

46
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,530
so it goes from 1971 2019 71 2001 and it

47
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,650
gets up to 2011 it goes 2011 2012 2013

48
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,829
2014 seems like a strange trick to

49
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,950
putting - making a leveling claim so all

50
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,840
I did like I tell our students is I took

51
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,770
that data we plotted it with even axes

52
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,869
and you get a fully different story so

53
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,820
that looks a lot different than the

54
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,140
previous graph and these kinds of things

55
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,509
happen literally every single day when

56
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:01,770
you study studies you have

57
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,420
plenty of material for your classes

58
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,649
every single day that you talk about

59
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,540
this kind of stuff but the point here is

60
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,270
that numbers carry Authority they hat

61
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,679
they sort of convey some sort of

62
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,180
precision and

63
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,980
science Nissa bout it they they sort of

64
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,680
convey a weight they almost seem to come

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,140
from nature they conveyed replicability

66
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,110
as well and that's why 37% of lightning

67
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,720
talks tend to be full of BS made-up

68
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,010
statistics so so watch out for them but

69
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,870
really if we know we've known for a long

70
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,790
time that words are human constructs

71
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,980
they have this subjectivity but again

72
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,140
numbers come straight from the sky it

73
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,940
seems like and it's these numbers that I

74
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,500
think that are more convincing we ought

75
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,180
we tend to worry about those people that

76
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,739
are just coming on the internet for the

77
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:46,420
first time or or people that don't have

78
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,859
quite the education that people in this

79
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:50,349
room have but I can tell you living on a

80
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,480
campus we are as fooled with numbers as

81
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,060
any kind of argument conveyance that we

82
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,680
have out there let me give you another

83
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,430
example

84
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,370
where words were pair fuzzy so this came

85
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,560
this was published in the hill you think

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,930
that you think the countries are giving

87
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,909
us their best people no they give us

88
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,549
their worst people you kind of get a

89
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,109
sense of what that means but let's put

90
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,370
real numbers behind it

91
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,989
Breitbart news on the same story

92
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:17,680
reported that 2139 daca recipients were

93
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,019
convicted or confused or accused of

94
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,540
crimes that number seems weighty it

95
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,669
sounds scary and I'll tell you that

96
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:27,639
number is actually real but what should

97
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,690
we be doing here yeah out of how many

98
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,639
so I actually looked this up as always

99
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,349
we should be putting numbers in context

100
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,449
if you look at this exact number point

101
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,310
three percent so one-third of one

102
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,440
percent of daca recipients have been

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,910
convicted of a crime compared to eight

104
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,400
point six percent of Americans that

105
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,849
tells a completely different story but

106
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,379
there's all sorts of ways of telling

107
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,910
stories and we do this in our class all

108
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,400
the time so even our best journals in

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
the Wall Street Journal New York Times

110
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,159
The Washington Post these are all really

111
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,519
high quality journal journalistic venues

112
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,500
but even here you find issues so here

113
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,599
there was a claim in this story that we

114
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,519
should be taxing the middle class and

115
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,769
there was a chart to make the point now

116
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,359
you can't see it fully so I'll zoom in

117
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:11,889
the only thing you need to know is that

118
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,750
the left are from the sort of the poor

119
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,790
bins the middle middle classes in the

120
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,199
middle and the end the writer the rich

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,060
and you can see something strange going

122
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,579
on with the bins there being varied

123
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,280
arbitrarily and if you do that I love

124
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,770
this sort of rebuttal of this

125
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,830
if you do that I can make a case with

126
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,599
the same data change you let me change

127
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,550
the bins I can say well I can rewrite

128
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,560
that story that we should tax the poor I

129
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
could read write the story in and tax

130
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
the middle class in some ways and then

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,169
if you let me still continue to to

132
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,360
manipulate the bins we can write a story

133
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,909
about taxing the rich the point is you

134
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,639
can rate you can tell any story you want

135
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,259
with data and we do this exercise and

136
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,419
students become very skeptical once they

137
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,550
realize how easy this is to do the point

138
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,990
is I don't think we're teaching students

139
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,060
how to question numbers the same ways we

140
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,620
do in our humanities courses and this is

141
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,210
something I've realized B I teach

142
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,530
classes and machine learning and data

143
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,479
engineering and a lot of our stem

144
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,449
students they're great you know I have

145
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,120
this lab that we you know we you know a

146
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,340
lot of what we do is technical bound and

147
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,069
and we do a lot of work in in building

148
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:16,500
systems and and students do this part

149
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,300
really well if they have them find the

150
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,860
Jacobian of the transformation they do

151
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,270
it beautifully if I have them replicate

152
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,219
a random forest algorithm they can do it

153
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,229
better than I can but it's in

154
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,849
questioning numbers like the same ways

155
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:28,139
that we question things in our

156
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,750
humanities classes and in you know when

157
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,919
we were looking at the symbolism of

158
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,990
birds in Macbeth and spend all those

159
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,729
hours thinking about that that critical

160
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,259
reasoning I think is missing in a lot of

161
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,479
the classes especially in this world now

162
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,779
is saturated with data and and graphs so

163
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,279
we might colleague and I Carl Bergson we

164
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,139
formed this class on on calling

165
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,210
in response to you know of course our

166
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,740
current climate but also selling we even

167
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,979
thing about for several years and and in

168
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,889
regards to the public session on on on

169
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,870
on science and answer where where we

170
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,789
makes mistakes in science but mostly

171
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,710
around this this this issue that we keep

172
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,900
seeing that we're not we're not as

173
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,150
critical of data as we should be now it

174
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,430
did go viral but the most exciting thing

175
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,469
is that it's being used in we've been

176
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,180
contacted by more than 70 universities

177
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,460
around the globe to use this sort of

178
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,539
content so they're sort of kind of this

179
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,979
 movement going which is kind of

180
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,430
nice to see and and we all we also been

181
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,509
working with the knight of the knight

182
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,310
foundation is supported a project taking

183
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,900
this kind of material and taking sort of

184
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,029
the energy around this kind of project

185
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:28,560
and trying to reach out to high school

186
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,300
students and so first we had to

187
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,539
eliminate the swear word so we rewrote a

188
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,849
website that scrape picks out all the

189
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:37,139
swear words and stuff and now we have

190
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,580
calling Boulevard instead of calling

191
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,670
 org

192
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,710
but we have been also spending time and

193
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,120
leveraging some of the excitement

194
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,890
happening in state legislatures that are

195
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,960
now requiring media literacy the state

196
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,220
of Washington which I live

197
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,540
hasn't doing everything right around

198
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,040
education I can promise you that but one

199
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,360
thing that they're doing is they're now

200
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,190
requiring media literacy and the current

201
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,140
and the curriculum we're having direct

202
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,460
school interaction around the country

203
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,570
these are just some of the schools that

204
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,220
will be starting to use and some have

205
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,990
already used it already and we're

206
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,570
working with high school teachers and

207
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,130
middle school teachers to get students

208
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,370
more aware of media literacy general

209
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,420
digital literacy and data reasoning

210
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,550
before they get to the university we

211
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,050
it's so interesting in this direct

212
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,610
engagement with students this is an

213
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,930
infographic from one of the students we

214
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,210
worked with in New Orleans and for

215
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,560
whatever reason things like Wikipedia

216
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,290
stand on low in terms their credibility

217
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,640
which we were just talking it at

218
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,290
breakfast this morning that I find that

219
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,670
interesting because I actually look at

220
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,410
the Wikipedia as one of our last

221
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,270
bastions of truth in the digital

222
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,030
environments I have students at U dub

223
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,260
they are working on curriculum

224
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,540
translation and and trying to work on

225
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,950
translating this to meet some of the

226
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,510
Common Core Standards we're actually

227
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,090
creating like physical not just digital

228
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,060
content so that when we have people that

229
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,620
we're going to have a big event at the

230
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,450
University and hopefully try to help

231
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,650
other universities do the same thing

232
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,880
where we bring students and high school

233
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,760
teachers on campus and work with them we

234
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,320
won't be using the word we'll be using

235
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,640
different terms mostly around data

236
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,900
reasoning at digital reasoning we're

237
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,180
also working with local groups in

238
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,740
Seattle trying to create public service

239
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,060
announcements that's been hard just

240
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,580
because conveying it and one minute is

241
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,950
always hard for myself for academics

242
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,690
where we always see nuances and and

243
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,130
we're working like with the trust

244
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,200
project and and hive lab media labs and

245
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,850
so that's sort of our efforts around

246
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,620
high school but I just want to mention

247
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,140
before I sort of summarize here that

248
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,170
there are all sorts of challenges that

249
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,210
we have and I work in a technology

250
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,890
department where we try to throw machine

251
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,120
learning out and I want us to do that

252
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
and I think you know we do have

253
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,650
discussions around policy but I really

254
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,270
think it's that one of the best things

255
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,950
that I can do is try to make our

256
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,780
information consumers smarter and so

257
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,890
that's what we're after but I want to

258
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,900
end I started with old school BS I want

259
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,070
to start with some things that concern

260
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,299
me now that I've been teaching this for

261
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,530
over a year and interacting with

262
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,420
students around the country there's this

263
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,880
old-school tech that I'm still worried

264
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,170
about and there's new school tech and

265
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,400
let me give you the two examples that

266
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,470
are sort of our most concerning to me

267
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,220
now so in Seattle we have we have a

268
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,900
football team that you know somewhat

269
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,730
controversial michael bennet after a big

270
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,130
win was shown here in the locker room

271
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,740
but with some nice photoshopping he was

272
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,080
then a burning flag was put in his hand

273
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,100
and this spread like incredibly virally

274
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,390
it's it was you know probably seen by

275
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,950
millions of people was discussed in the

276
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,110
national news but it's this kind of

277
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,490
technology if you guys have seen it's

278
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,680
not just vote photoshopping it's boy

279
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,330
shopping that came out of my University

280
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,830
and my call I I'm like I know colleagues

281
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,450
that built this software that allows you

282
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,660
to basically cut and paste voice now

283
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,700
photoshopping was already a pain now

284
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,900
we've got voice shopping and it's

285
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,250
getting better and better and it

286
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,300
concerns me and I think even my

287
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,280
colleagues I try to talk to them and I

288
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,840
think they start to see the issues as

289
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,520
well but it's this new technology that's

290
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,110
coming that that scares me students are

291
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,220
good at some things but I'm not sure

292
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,170
they're good at this there's also this

293
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,690
issue around the spreading of science

294
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,070
that's what I'm most concerned about

295
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,840
misinformation in science we have

296
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,000
fluoridation which is a very big problem

297
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,350
actually was just talking to a dental

298
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,240
group and they have a lot of truth decay

299
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,550
as well that was their our little little

300
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,940
joke and this is and so I'll I'll end

301
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,950
here with just this idea that search

302
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,410
engines sort of just that somehow create

303
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,050
give credibility just by being found on

304
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,970
the web so if I found do vaccinations

305
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,310
cause bacon shaken baby syndrome you're

306
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,540
gonna be the most ridiculous than you

307
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,000
ever seen and this is my final side that

308
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,190
I was my son my six-year-old son loves

309
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,320
the International Space Station but the

310
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,180
last time I went on that in incognito

311
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,670
mode three recommendations for Flat

312
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,380
Earth so these are the kinds of things

313
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,210
that I'm concerned with but it's mostly

314
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,980
around the data and statistics and if

315
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,620
you want to follow us the last thing is

316
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,450
the a symmetry principle the

317
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,710
amount of energy necessary to refute

318
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,120
 is many orders of magnitude

319
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,920
harder to clean it up so let's do it now

320
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,940
thank you for listening

321
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,469
[Applause]
