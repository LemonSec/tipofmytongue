1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,520
hi everybody it's great to be here I

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,840
just got off the red-eye from San

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,879
Francisco on three hours of sleep I'm

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,230
gonna rely on my notes a little more

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,510
than I normally would thank you for

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,240
bearing with me I was here actually a

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,830
couple days ago and a couple days before

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,299
that and a couple days before that I've

9
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,090
been I testified in front of the Senate

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,949
Select Intelligence Committee on this

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,350
topic on Wednesday of last week so some

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,449
of my remarks are drawn from my

13
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,980
statement from the record there because

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,939
I felt like there would be an

15
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,769
interesting provocation for this group

16
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,059
as well so over the past decade

17
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,579
disinformation misinformation and social

18
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,649
media hoaxes have evolved from a

19
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,270
nuisance into a high-stakes information

20
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,250
more but our frameworks for dealing with

21
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,530
them remain the same we discussed

22
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,059
counter messaging we discussed counter

23
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,649
narratives and we treat this as a

24
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,390
problem of truth and narrative rather

25
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,789
than as a problem of mass dissemination

26
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,390
of of maligned narratives as well as

27
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,579
signatures that indicate adversarial

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,559
involvement in the ecosystem so we're

29
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,820
still treating this as a problem of

30
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,589
truth rather than as a problem of

31
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,180
something that would be more akin to

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,270
cybersecurity so information warfare as

33
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,979
a cybersecurity issue is an ongoing

34
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,840
national security issue and it must be

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,950
addressed through a collaboration

36
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,960
between governments responsible for the

37
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,909
safety of their citizens and private

38
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,350
industry responsible for the integrity

39
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,350
of their platforms so propaganda and

40
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,850
malign narratives have existed for a

41
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,920
very long time but today's influence

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,020
operations because they co-opted popular

43
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,850
social platforms are materially

44
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,920
different its propaganda spread by

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,960
friends to friends seated into groups

46
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,479
pushed through pages sent via ads in

47
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,790
some cases sent directly via things like

48
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,430
messenger to get activists to take the

49
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,070
action out onto the streets so to

50
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,869
conduct an operation adversaries

51
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,450
leverage the entire media ecosystem to

52
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,070
push the narrative and manufacture the

53
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,049
appearance of popular consensus the

54
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,670
operation is planned on one platform

55
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,490
often starting in a message board then

56
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,869
it's moved to something like Twitter

57
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,610
where there's hope that mainstream media

58
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,899
will pick it up it's pushed through

59
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,869
Facebook into pages and groups and the

60
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,030
goal is to take advantage of things like

61
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,740
trending algorithms for algorithmic

62
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,830
amplification eventually if the content

63
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,910
stays up long enough it'll be

64
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,440
recommended via the recommendation

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,390
as well so we have a system where the

66
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,120
entire ecosystem is co-opted but instead

67
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,530
of looking at this as a systemic problem

68
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,240
we're still addressing it in a very

69
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,910
piecemeal way we're reliant on private

70
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,920
platforms to kind of get their own ducks

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
in a row on one individual platform

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,460
without recognizing that this is a

73
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,520
systemic issue so we're here in part

74
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
because the internet research agency

75
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,300
employed this PlayBook they conducted an

76
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,770
operation that leveraged our social

77
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,540
networks to spread disinformation and

78
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,730
propaganda directly to American citizens

79
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,790
now that operation began in 2013 and it

80
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,650
continued through the 2016 election

81
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,630
cycle and then it actually increased in

82
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,650
2017

83
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,470
so the goal was not solely to manipulate

84
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,270
the election but there are some

85
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,670
indications that because the 2016

86
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,820
campaign was so easy things began to

87
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,430
even increase in 2017

88
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,830
so the IRA content on Facebook and

89
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,690
Instagram alone had hundreds of millions

90
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,730
of engagements estimates from Facebook

91
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,310
indicate that 146 million users across

92
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,580
two platforms were affected the campaign

93
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,320
did appear on every single major

94
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,270
platform in the social network ecosystem

95
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,540
reddit tumblr medium YouTube Google+

96
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,630
Twitter vine Twitter's vine video app

97
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,690
even meme boards on Pinterest popular

98
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,160
games such as Pokemon go were

99
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,290
incorporated into the operation and then

100
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,090
outside of social platforms a number of

101
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,340
web sites were created that hosted

102
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,140
original written content and they looked

103
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,060
like the kind of citizen journalism work

104
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,440
that's become kind of increasingly

105
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,930
prevalent today so they did a very good

106
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,060
job making their content look like what

107
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,709
the audience expected it to look like

108
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,230
they co-opted White House petitions they

109
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,430
created Twitter accounts that

110
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,620
masqueraded as local news and topics

111
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,540
around the gamut from kind of high

112
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,330
emotional resonance social issues to

113
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,340
topics like war the environment

114
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,590
corporate greed GMOs energy policy and

115
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,950
immigration so the internet research

116
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,900
agencies campaign focused on a variety

117
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,840
of of socially divisive issues but the

118
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,269
primary one was racial tension that's

119
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,010
because there are very real race issues

120
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,918
that are deeply problematic in American

121
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,600
society and so they were able to take

122
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,418
that and turn that into both politicized

123
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,340
narratives and culture based narratives

124
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,919
and so race was by far the number one

125
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,330
topic that they pushed out across

126
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,120
all social platforms hundreds of

127
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,159
thousands of Americans liked Facebook

128
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,229
pages with names like black Java start

129
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,870
of Texas and stop all invaders and the

130
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,129
percentage of explicitly political

131
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,990
content that mentioned the candidates by

132
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,909
name was small it was approximately 10%

133
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,860
of the content that we know about so far

134
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,199
but in pages targeting it was it was

135
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,539
actually unified in its opposition to

136
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,060
one candidate to Secretary Clinton so

137
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,530
there were pages that targeted both the

138
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,300
right and the left the pages that

139
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,400
targeted the Left did include a number

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,580
of anti candidate Trump posts but they

141
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,460
were also uniformly anti candidate

142
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,930
Clinton and so there were a lot of

143
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,550
suppression narratives particularly

144
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,750
targeting the black community

145
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,639
particularly saying things like a vote

146
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,219
for Jill Stein is not a wasted vote the

147
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:13,680
primary was stolen from from candidate

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,419
Sanders etc and so there were a lot of

149
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,979
narratives around suppression on that

150
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,599
side and then on the right it was

151
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,719
uniformly Pro candidate Trump there was

152
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:23,250
actually a substantial amount of anti

153
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,169
senator Rubio and anti senator Cruz

154
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,479
content kind of within that ten percent

155
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,750
so the only the social networks that

156
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,580
hosted the campaign are in a position to

157
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,620
gauge its full impact on changing voter

158
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,960
attitudes which is which is one of the

159
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,969
main problems today we know that it had

160
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:40,710
phenomenal amounts of engagements in the

161
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,110
hundreds of millions we know that there

162
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,759
were tons of comments left on organic

163
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,960
posts we know that there were comments

164
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,900
left on the Instagram posts but nobody

165
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,969
has that data nobody really knows what

166
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:52,589
happened so in order to have a full

167
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:55,409
picture of where we are today we're

168
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,089
really reliant on social platforms

169
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,129
so although the hearing that I was part

170
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,690
of was convened because of the IRA

171
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,610
interference in 2016

172
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,500
Russia wasn't the first to target

173
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,659
American citizens with propaganda we

174
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,550
actually saw Isis do a remarkable job

175
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,529
building a virtual caliphate similarly

176
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:12,479
across every social platform similarly

177
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,729
beginning in 2013 but with remarkably

178
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,039
high visibility everything was branded

179
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,629
with a black flag as they built their

180
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,669
brand across the social ecosystem and

181
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,770
because of a lack of coordination both

182
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,870
within the government within the between

183
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,580
the government and private sector and

184
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,129
then within private sector nobody was in

185
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,659
charge there was no framework for

186
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:33,000
dealing with this and so basically what

187
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,099
happened is anybody who was watching saw

188
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,630
that this was a phenomenally vulnerable

189
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,080
ecosystem ripe for manipulation so I

190
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,310
think one of the things that were

191
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,570
gonna have an opportunity to talk about

192
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,100
today as some of the policy proposals

193
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,770
associated with this Senator Warner

194
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,410
recently put out 20 and because I've

195
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,790
only got five minutes or three minutes

196
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,260
left I'm not gonna have time to go

197
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,420
through them all but I would encourage

198
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,910
you to read his his paper on this to get

199
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,830
a sense of how government is thinking

200
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,830
about this some of it is related to

201
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,980
things like tracking the malign

202
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,780
narratives themselves with a duty to

203
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,520
clearly and conspicuously label BOTS

204
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,340
duty to determine origin of posts duty

205
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,470
to identify inauthentic accounts these

206
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,510
are things that are very difficult to do

207
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,190
from a technical perspective but these

208
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,810
are the ideas that we're starting to see

209
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,410
floated and then require an interagency

210
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,540
task force for countering asymmetric

211
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,600
threats to democratic institutions so in

212
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,320
addition to the ongoing exploitation of

213
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,700
social divisions the targeting of

214
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,320
elections and disinformation meant to

215
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,970
your political events we're beginning to

216
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,130
see campaigns targeting industry we're

217
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,250
beginning to see campaigns thriving in

218
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,380
regards to things like anti-gmo

219
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,570
narratives energy policy interference

220
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,990
entertainment interference we're seeing

221
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,940
things that were undertaken by state

222
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,290
actors begin to be undertaken by

223
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,570
domestic ideologues which is where that

224
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,270
line between free speech and how we deal

225
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,640
with the platform how we deal with

226
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,570
manipulation of our platforms while

227
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,000
still respecting free speech is a deep

228
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,940
challenge so the evolution of social

229
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,410
media propaganda and influence

230
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,630
techniques will bring serious threats we

231
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,070
should anticipate an increase in the

232
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,540
misuse of less popular and less

233
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,340
resourced social platforms and an

234
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,390
increase in the use of peer-to-peer

235
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,580
messaging services we do believe that

236
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,590
future campaigns will be compounded by

237
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,230
the employment of witting or unwitting

238
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,640
us individuals we're going to see a lot

239
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,380
more narrative laundering we're going to

240
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,030
see a lot more incorporation of audio

241
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,220
and video manipulation we're going to

242
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,690
see operations that make it difficult

243
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,840
for citizens to trust their own eyes

244
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,280
so this will be one of the defining

245
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,380
threats of our generation and looking

246
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,299
forward to discussing it with everyone

247
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,730
in this room today influence operations

248
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,980
exploit divisions in our society using

249
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,690
vulnerabilities in our information

250
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,730
ecosystem they take advantage of

251
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,170
America's commitment to freedom of

252
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,850
speech and the free flow of ideas and

253
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,980
the social media platforms cannot and

254
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,790
should not be the sole defenders of

255
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,250
chrystine public discourse so looking

256
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,900
forward very much to the afternoon

257
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,360
sessions and to speaking with you all

258
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,500
individually about the work that we're

259
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,340
doing at new knowledge and at Mozilla

260
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,629
