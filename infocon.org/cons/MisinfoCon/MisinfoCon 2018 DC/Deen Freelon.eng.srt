1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:05,310
okay great okay great okay so um I like

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,960
many academics I have a lot to say and

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,910
not enough time to say it in so people

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,960
tell me I talk fast if you don't

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,130
understand anything we'll try to get to

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,170
it in Q&A so let's get started

7
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,400
today I may be talking about this

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,949
information right so in my field I'm

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,760
still trying to get people to

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,230
distinguish Wien dis and misinformation

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,060
so I'll try to articulate that

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,130
difference as clearly as I can this

13
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,340
morning so I define this information in

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,359
that box should go all the way around

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,429
the text this information as the

16
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,619
surreptitious purposeful distribution of

17
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,989
messages and then to to harm targets and

18
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,510
or benefits sources in many cases

19
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,969
including the one we'll discuss today

20
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:40,350
you know harm when the target is exactly

21
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,770
the same as benefiting the source and of

22
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,270
course the messages that are distributed

23
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,219
are although in many cases they are

24
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,050
false in many cases they are not

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,730
necessarily false right and so to break

26
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,110
down these different criteria right

27
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,480
we've got a hidden source as we do in

28
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,859
the case of the IRA which I'll discuss

29
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,789
in a little bit the source has to have

30
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,349
knowledge of the messages of purpose

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,339
right so that's that's what

32
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,320
differentiates this information from

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,270
misinformation when you know that what

34
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,680
you're distributing has some nefarious

35
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,170
purpose or is false and as this

36
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,180
information when you don't know that is

37
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,610
misinformation there has to be an

38
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,200
intention to harm target targets in

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,880
other words this just can't be oh well

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,110
I'm distributing something that's false

41
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,000
that may or may not have any a given

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,090
effect there's a very distinct intention

43
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,070
that goes along with that and of course

44
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,790
in many cases there is also a in most

45
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,170
cases there's a intention to benefit

46
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,299
source and in the case I'll discuss of

47
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,060
course the harming target and benefits

48
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,090
the source is kind of the same thing all

49
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,450
right

50
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,600
so in the study of disinformation we

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,070
there are sort of three major questions

52
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,869
and I believe that the scholarly study

53
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,820
of this is in very early stages and so

54
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,040
with three questions that we really need

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,380
to know at the beginning of any analysis

56
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,689
of disinformation firstly who is being

57
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,960
targeted secondly what's being said

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,490
which gets it the essence of what

59
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,500
digital disinformation actually is or

60
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,810
disinformation more generally and then

61
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,360
thirdly in this case which identities

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,390
and tactics are the most successful

63
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,710
and the analysis I'll present will

64
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,000
address the first two of those questions

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm a paper that's currently under

66
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,080
review that will address all three in

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,340
case you're interested so please watch

68
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,120
for that so how many people in here know

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,870
who the IRA is okay great people who did

70
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,280
a good job of explaining what the IRA is

71
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,480
so I can sort of breeze through this

72
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,060
slide so Twitter claims I'm gonna start

73
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,320
right in the middle sort of claims it

74
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,570
has identified almost 4,000 IRA accounts

75
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,790
as of January 18th of this year I sent

76
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,110
it a note at the very end of last year

77
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,670
in which it contacted me and I'll ask

78
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,010
you again this year where they contacted

79
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,870
almost 700,000 users who interacted with

80
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,790
IRA content now an interaction as

81
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,820
defined by Twitter includes engagements

82
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,870
quote unquote that's clicking on

83
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,120
something or applying to somebody not

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,769
views and so the actual number of people

85
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:58,600
who saw IRA content is likely much much

86
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,850
higher and they flagged at least hundred

87
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,260
seventy five thousand almost hundred

88
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,670
seventy six thousand tweets that were

89
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,860
posted I believe within the six months

90
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,380
six weeks sorry previous to the election

91
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,850
the total number is much higher than

92
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,970
that but this is sort of a baseline

93
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,260
amount of content the Twitter

94
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,110
acknowledged at the end of last year

95
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,780
slash the beginning of this one and so

96
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,880
fast forward to February 15th 14th

97
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,040
rather this year when NBC news of all

98
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,900
source of all sources released two

99
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,750
hundred thousand Russian troll tweets

100
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,810
which I analyzed in this analysis just

101
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,390
this past week or last week rather the

102
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,970
news site 538 released almost three

103
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,470
million such tweets and so I got to get

104
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,030
it analyze those and so this was the

105
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,890
analysis I'd done before that which I

106
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,739
think will cover much of what is already

107
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,329
known and hopefully some some new things

108
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,610
as well so down under those and analyze

109
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,930
those and that's what this analysis is

110
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,640
based on here's some basic descriptive

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,620
statistics of what's going on there were

112
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,510
almost 3,000 or so tweets that were

113
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,310
identified by the US House Intelligence

114
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,620
Committee on November 1st of last year

115
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,380
the dataset that I downloaded and

116
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,410
constructed not only the NBC News tweets

117
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,870
but also some from the Internet Archive

118
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,500
included four hundred and thirty nine

119
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,160
tweets which is about 16% of those let's

120
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,440
see there were just over 200,000 tweets

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,289
in the NBC dataset

122
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,990
almost a little over 7,000 in the in an

123
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,390
archive dataset and pulling out all the

124
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,590
Russian language ones of which there

125
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,190
were a few

126
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,500
there were just south of 200,000 of

127
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,390
those tweets which span between July

128
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:37,180
14th and July 2014 and September 2017 so

129
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,470
let me get it I'm just gonna really

130
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,820
quickly talk about the methods I can get

131
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,710
into this in greater detail during Q&A

132
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,240
if anybody's really interested I did

133
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,500
some content analysis a little bit of

134
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,910
qualitative elaboration to figure out

135
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,860
who they targeted a little bit of

136
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,750
computational descriptive and some topic

137
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,950
modeling to figure out what they said

138
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,570
and in terms of what worked which I'm

139
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,740
not going to talk about because I don't

140
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,630
have time and it's a nested regression

141
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,000
to figure that out

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,370
so this is a graph of IRA activity by

143
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,830
month this that goes what Rene said in

144
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,440
the last session that activity spiked

145
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,880
during the 2012 2016 rather election you

146
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,020
could see that it goes up right in the

147
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,870
middle of 2016 but really sort of

148
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,960
continues a pretty big spike after the

149
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,420
election and only really dies down at

150
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,800
least as far as the data that I looked

151
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,670
at toward the end of purpose where the

152
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,190
middle and second half of 2017 so you do

153
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,930
see this continuing so the slope of

154
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:35,830
activity after the 2016 election so I

155
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,050
find this particular graph interesting

156
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,550
because it shows account creation dates

157
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,200
over time which you'll notice if you can

158
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,490
see those dates at the bottom there is

159
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,520
that a lot of the accounts were created

160
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,260
many years prior to the 2016 election

161
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,850
right so you know Vladimir Putin didn't

162
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,990
like roll out of bed in the middle of

163
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,910
2015 and say wow we should really hijack

164
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,310
the 2016 election this is years in the

165
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,990
making right so they've had these

166
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,400
accounts that sort of sitting out there

167
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,400
it's waiting to be activated when an apt

168
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
purpose was found which of course it was

169
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,540
in the 2016 election so these are some

170
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,610
music categories that they targeted if

171
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,260
you've read the 538 article that came

172
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,370
out last week where they sort of

173
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,510
categorize they look at some of the

174
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,130
different categories this is sort of

175
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,870
similar overlaps a little bit but is

176
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,910
also kind of different the big red line

177
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,950
is at the left is um pro-trump

178
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,900
Republicans there are also a number of

179
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,400
anti-trump liberals that's the blue one

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,110
to the right of that there are a bunch

181
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,400
that we're trying to be local news

182
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,900
outlets that's the gray one that's third

183
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,540
from the left a bunch that we're trying

184
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,270
to be black activists and contrary to

185
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,990
reports there were a few pro-trump folks

186
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,720
on the left a few anti-trump Republicans

187
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,100
get a little bit of fake news and folks

188
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,940
pretending to be Arabic or from the of

189
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,710
the Islamic faith it from the Middle

190
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,680
East but those were just a few

191
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,590
individuals there yeah and these are

192
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,700
some examples of some of the tweets that

193
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,870
I managed to fish off of there you've

194
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,400
probably seen some of these this is from

195
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,770
a pro Trump right user called panda more

196
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,930
13 you look at some of those tweets in

197
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,190
many cases I think they're a little bit

198
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,380
hard to distinguish from actual Trump

199
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,390
voters but you could judge for yours you

200
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,220
can judge for yourself right like this

201
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,330
is you know you don't to take my word

202
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,200
for it it's right there on the screen

203
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,810
for you here's one from the anti-trump

204
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,880
left and you can see actually that the

205
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,380
one tweet that I have down there is sort

206
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,330
of anti Trump it's kind of like soft

207
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,040
balling I think but that's just my

208
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,220
personal opinion then you've got this

209
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,780
news outlet outlet it's kind of online

210
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,400
Cleveland kind of sounds like the sort

211
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,050
of thing that you might think was sort

212
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,400
of a credible news outlet if you weren't

213
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,900
actually from there and the news

214
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,330
articles seem to be things that could be

215
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,050
plausible but again I'm not really sure

216
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,940
what they were going for here because it

217
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,470
sort of mimics it in a way that's I

218
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,169
think kind of you know faithful and then

219
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,490
of course these are the black activists

220
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,630
you can see that this one in particular

221
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,870
is heavily anti police and so trying to

222
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,980
get on the whole black lives matter

223
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,990
train including this sort of you know

224
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,300
quote-unquote urban use of for for UFO

225
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,280
armed but you know so that's that's one

226
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,979
that tried to do that so these are the

227
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,600
top hashtags you can see top

228
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,950
conservatives most of these the red ones

229
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,660
are conservative leanings you can see

230
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,370
top conservatives on Twitter mega

231
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,190
Patriot journalists Network Christians

232
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,450
Christian conservatives on Twitter

233
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,270
there's one that's sort of you know left

234
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,010
or right which is hashtag Trump which

235
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,330
could be used by people who are in favor

236
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,370
or people who are against a few that

237
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,020
have sort of maybe journalistic in

238
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,050
nature politics and news but seven out

239
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,780
of ten are right leading in terms of

240
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,060
their prevalence I here's some type of

241
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,380
model categories in terms of what they

242
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,060
actually talked about election 2016 was

243
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,400
by far the top category conservative

244
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,530
politics specifically hash tag games

245
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,760
black activist I do want to show you

246
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,919
some examples of these so this is one of

247
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,750
the topics on the left is some of the

248
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,830
terms that popped up in the election

249
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,950
2016 topic Trump politics Clinton Donald

250
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,170
etc and conservative politics you can

251
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,580
see the right leaning with those right

252
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,500
leading hashtags t copy J net

253
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,959
Christian conservatives on Twitter Trump

254
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,550
for president Islam kills wake up

255
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,200
Amerika etc so that's one of the major

256
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,760
differences there here are some that are

257
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,339
sort of between a black activist got out

258
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:05,500
all the time you see some that are that

259
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,360
are sort of generally associated with

260
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,860
that topic and then some that are kind

261
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,480
of hashtag games which illustrates the

262
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,720
fact that these folks are really trying

263
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,740
to infiltrate things that aren't

264
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,089
necessarily political all the time in

265
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,500
trying to get on what is most popular

266
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,700
what are people gonna be paying

267
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,250
attention to as but they may not

268
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,420
necessarily be political

269
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,459
oh let's see so here are some key

270
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:26,410
findings with a target program

271
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,209
conservatives anti-trump liberals black

272
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,100
activists local news consumers not

273
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,300
Hillary supporters since we've also

274
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,160
heard what did they say they were

275
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,350
talking about election 2016 pro Trump

276
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,930
Pro Bernie anti-hillary black issues pop

277
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,149
culture in the Middle East what worked

278
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,750
the users that have been created more

279
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,160
recently were more effective covering

280
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
black issues and conservative content

281
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,850
there's some broader implications it

282
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,410
didn't cover all bases equally they see

283
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,940
blacks conservatives is prime target

284
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,649
they aim not only to sow chaos but also

285
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,930
to push certain political agendas to the

286
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,240
exclusion of others and finally much of

287
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,860
the content is totally innocuous and

288
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,060
even fun maybe they're just trying to

289
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,470
gain America's trust for their ultimate

290
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,649
nefarious purposes and there it is all

291
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,420
right

292
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:17,669
[Applause]
