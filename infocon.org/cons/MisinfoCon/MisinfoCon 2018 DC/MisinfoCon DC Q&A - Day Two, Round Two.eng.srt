1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Oh back there great thank you

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,759
please state your name and affiliation

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,069
hi I'm Sara Otte so from the Philip

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,360
Merrill College of journalism at the

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,719
University of Maryland and I want to

6
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:14,099
kind of throw a little grenade over the

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,279
parapet here I have a political

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,600
scientist so of course I'm going to

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,770
disagree with every other political

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,580
scientist in the room so what do you do

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,220
if and and if you've come up with these

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,970
these these wonderful interesting things

13
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,700
but but what do you do if 20% of your

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,600
audience of your particular media outlet

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
actually well 80% voted for Trump and

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,579
and I disagree that and I very much

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,420
agree with the speaker that said we

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,370
can't just say we're right we're right

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,100
you're wrong so where do we go forward

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,030
in truthiness if if 30% of the American

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,100
population has a different truth than

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,949
the other 70% because I don't think it's

23
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,629
just we can shine a light on the facts

24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,430
and say look let us enlighten you

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,349
because they're not going to come to the

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,200
same conclusion so that that's my I know

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,060
it's an unanswerable question but I

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,890
would be interested in some attempts to

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:20,310
say how do we get beyond that I am i

30
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,470
working yes I am I said but I just have

31
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,159
one thought on that really which is in

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,509
the form of a question

33
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,680
because that's safe which is well what

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,579
voices would they listen to what what

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,979
does a resonant interesting story mean

36
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,280
to them that isn't just nonsense on

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,579
stilts so I was very struck for example

38
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,470
the way Michael Moore spoke during the

39
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,960
election cycle and afterwards because he

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,490
knew from the inside the Trump

41
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,659
demographic if there is such a thing who

42
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,540
were the people from these communities

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,329
who are worth listening to

44
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,869
who are the voices that people will hear

45
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,270
where is the common ground I don't think

46
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,979
it seems we very dangerous to have a

47
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,348
dichotomy of saying well over there

48
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,960
there belies I think it's

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,650
a great challenge too but surely surely

50
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,660
one we're up to journalistically to

51
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,960
Commission and report upon people who

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,670
have something to say that can be heard

53
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,070
by diverse audiences that isn't just

54
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:33,280
wish fulfillment and lies I was my mind

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,540
I was simply going to say if we start

56
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,820
with that we'll make no headway if we

57
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,320
start with you're wrong and I'm right so

58
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,150
it's that simple we like to use

59
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,370
historical examples and stay away from

60
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,470
contemporary ones then sometimes they're

61
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,660
they're less charged and then people can

62
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,940
have this moments of self realization

63
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,460
but I think that's going to be the the

64
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,600
real key to success I have a quick

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,430
comment it I don't think this really

66
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,800
addresses the this question but it is

67
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,060
something that it has occurred to me

68
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,940
recently which plays a role and one way

69
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,230
in which one important thing that

70
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,020
traditional media had sort of converged

71
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,290
on is the clear distinction between

72
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,820
between news and opinion between facts

73
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,920
and opinion and I think that that line

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,630
is very easily blurred with new media or

75
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,310
fragmentation of the new media landscape

76
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,860
the role of social media and so on and I

77
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,050
think that that so when we talk about

78
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,060
what's true and what's not true and

79
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,740
what's facts and what's not facts I

80
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,020
think that that line gets blurred so

81
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,970
it's okay for somebody else to have a

82
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,360
different opinion right so but sometimes

83
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,730
a person may feel like the other people

84
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,440
are saying no because your opinion is

85
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,540
different from mine then therefore it is

86
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,540
false an opinion cannot be false but the

87
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,470
facts can so trying to get at a clear

88
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,540
labeling or distinction between facts

89
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,290
and opinion

90
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,900
outside of mainstream media or to bring

91
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,600
that kind of distinction that we have

92
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,850
sort of learned in mainstream media to

93
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,230
new media could help take out some of

94
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,110
that I think of that challenge of of

95
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,450
who's you know your truth versus my

96
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,180
truth instead of having that

97
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,829
conversation we should have a dialogue

98
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,690
about your opinion versus my opinion and

99
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,120
they're both valid

100
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,910
whereas facts are some are true and some

101
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,180
are not

102
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,420
great next any any next question anyone

103
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,210
tweezer ed yep thank you Lisa repelled

104
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,980
in with the International Foundation for

105
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,440
electoral systems so over the past few

106
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,120
days across the panels in the workshops

107
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,610
we've heard a lot of the words solution

108
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,200
ISM was thrown out in one of our side

109
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,480
panels the idea of a buck shot of

110
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,090
solutions that were sort of looking for

111
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,410
what what can we do what what

112
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,420
interventions are possible and I wonder

113
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,340
what conversations are we having around

114
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,950
what's effective how are we measuring

115
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,200
efficacy how are we measuring impact

116
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,780
because while in the initial stages the

117
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,760
idea of a lot of different approaches

118
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,920
and solutions is attractive over time

119
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,110
starting to converge around what is

120
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,730
working and are any of these potential

121
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,650
interventions actually creating harm

122
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,090
where we think they should be helping

123
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,740
and I just wonder how robust is that

124
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,030
conversation and what are some of the

125
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,320
different approaches that are being

126
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:33,730
taken towards that thank you I'll just

127
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,770
say that we're very far from there it is

128
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,540
hard to assess effectiveness of

129
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,760
solutions and sometimes nearly

130
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,500
impossible because you cannot create two

131
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,310
different worlds platforms are doing

132
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,080
some of that in ways that we

133
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,640
unfortunately don't see and are not

134
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,630
published so that's not necessarily

135
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,340
helpful to the general research

136
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,620
community and but that I know that there

137
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,970
are a lot of efforts trying to move in

138
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,010
that direction so for example the social

139
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,950
science one Commission has been

140
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,860
discussed and through a partnership

141
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,780
between some funding agencies including

142
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,130
some of the same ones that are funding

143
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,340
this meeting and and Facebook at least

144
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,570
there is the beginning of a conversation

145
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,420
about what data platforms might provide

146
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,380
to begin to quantify reach and effects

147
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,950
of both phenomena that you know that we

148
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,030
consider negative and also of

149
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,770
countermeasures but it's a very very

150
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,300
very beginning of that discussion

151
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,460
and we're very far in my opinion yeah oh

152
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,770
good good with our product we have

153
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,629
evaluation baked in to everything we're

154
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:54,610
doing and we've just we're now working

155
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,780
with the Corporation for Public

156
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,419
Broadcasting on a large evaluation grant

157
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,800
to look at the efficacy and strategies

158
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,720
were mining student comments we're

159
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,180
unpacking all of that work and in some

160
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,000
attempt to try to figure out efficacy of

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,819
the product so it's there I think you

162
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,009
know Phil just said platforms have a

163
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,379
greater capability to looking at the

164
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,650
data around solution so I think that in

165
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,969
my experience with the other groups that

166
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:23,800
we're working with a similar work is

167
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,110
happening I think that there's the next

168
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,270
stage is figuring out how do we how do

169
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,740
we connect all of those solutions

170
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,379
together and and as it also said we're

171
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:35,379
far from that I just want to quickly add

172
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,800
I think Phil's it was a filler animation

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,460
of over time is that evaluation I know

174
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,840
talking to folks in the World Bank who

175
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,039
do international development work they

176
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,960
said well you can take an evaluator a

177
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,349
snapshot a short-term and you might

178
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,389
think oh the project's a success we fed

179
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,039
all these people we built roads we did

180
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,139
this and says well you look at the

181
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:57,789
community two or three years later and

182
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,770
find out that that actually was a very

183
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,509
disruptive process and changed the

184
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:03,219
dynamics and your graphs show that over

185
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:06,940
time things can change since it wasn't

186
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,800
mentioned I'll just add in the education

187
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,069
community not much is being done to

188
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,479
evaluate this because there's not much

189
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,389
policy or let's be honest the high

190
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,080
stakes test attached to these skills and

191
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,879
until there is there probably won't be

192
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,919
much measurement and I'm not advocating

193
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,810
for another high-stakes test before

194
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,969
anyone thinks that I think we a question

195
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:32,708
the back over there Rick Weiss I'm the

196
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,649
director of sideline which is a

197
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,820
philanthropically supported free service

198
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,289
for reporters that connects them to

199
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,059
scientists to help them get facts into

200
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,370
their stories and we focus a lot on

201
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,169
scientists this is to follow on the

202
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,910
question from the Philip Merrill school

203
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,769
because scientists have a long history

204
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,230
of being relatively trusted by the

205
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,449
population the relatively high Dean's

206
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,430
like 40%

207
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,710
over the last many years we says better

208
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,279
than journalists and members of Congress

209
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,529
but I'm wondering whether other

210
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:04,050
populations who are not in the core of

211
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,839
the Trump voter ship but who could gain

212
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,970
the trust of that voter ship really

213
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,470
ought to be getting more attention and

214
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,620
I'm thinking in particular of

215
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,930
celebrities and sports figures and I

216
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,279
haven't heard anything in the last

217
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,930
couple days about focusing on those

218
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,430
populations which I think have

219
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,730
tremendous influence and have and could

220
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,279
do a lot of good if they were targeted

221
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,320
and put to work for this purpose I

222
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,520
wonder if any of you have any experience

223
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,410
with that or thoughts about it

224
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,680
I think marketers have very good

225
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,019
experience with that I don't know that

226
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,389
that same idea has been exported to this

227
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:48,959
domain we we do seem to find that those

228
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,649
who are pushing this information seem to

229
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:56,790
think that targeting influential nodes

230
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,380
in the network is effective so I think

231
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,560
that's a very good question yeah we got

232
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
a question Oh back there

233
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,560
good hi my name is Shawna Gordon akin I

234
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,490
was struck by during multiple of your

235
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:21,329
talks the role of attention in people

236
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,399
having the ability to assess the quality

237
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,699
of information and I was wondering if

238
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:29,850
you have any thoughts about environments

239
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,000
whether online are off that strive to

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,850
give people the time or resources they

241
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,019
need to devote attention as opposed to

242
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,819
sort of like competitively fighting over

243
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:47,880
it or restricting attention I have a

244
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,720
couple of thoughts about that I think I

245
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,660
find it very interesting when I look at

246
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,819
the research into how people spend their

247
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:59,279
time whether it's pew and the US or

248
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,360
Ofcom with the Kaiser Family Foundation

249
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,529
and others who gather data on this that

250
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,449
there is almost a saturation point in

251
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,839
people's waking hours with media and

252
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,959
multitasking but that so called digital

253
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,110
natives appear to events quite a strong

254
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,360
desire for a more granular control over

255
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,870
this time than we saw five or ten years

256
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,810
ago by which I mean rather than wanting

257
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,490
to do everything all the time on one

258
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,860
great big platform people seek different

259
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,000
registers and this is connected to the

260
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,589
idea of what sometimes called the

261
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,779
migration of the social stack which

262
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,930
simply means that the whole stack of our

263
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,670
social activities ranging up from the

264
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,259
most intimate moments with our family to

265
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:44,910
our relationships with state and

266
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,509
employer

267
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,000
these are all being kind of digitally

268
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,399
mediated or if technology is implicated

269
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,150
in them

270
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,860
and I think there's a lot of very

271
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,250
exciting stuff around in the development

272
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,290
of services and modes of practice that

273
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,430
are congenial to people's needs people

274
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,470
don't want all their time to be the same

275
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,300
they don't want one size to fit all and

276
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,880
whether it's in formal practices where

277
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,210
people now putting away your phone is a

278
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,220
gesture of respect towards someone

279
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,860
rather than getting it out I still

280
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,050
remember loudly using a phone being a

281
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,510
status symbol whereas now being offline

282
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,580
and uncontacted but as the CEOs boast

283
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,250
and so I think there's an interesting as

284
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,990
it were kind of nexus of forces here in

285
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,760
Europe we have regulation in France and

286
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,580
elsewhere about employees not being

287
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,970
expected or to be contactable outside of

288
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,040
working hours debates around schools

289
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,920
again France and Germany varlet leading

290
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,330
the way here about about their being

291
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,700
kind of mobile and connectivity free

292
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,770
zones more awareness around health and

293
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,830
so on this is a kind of mosaic but I

294
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,100
think in in kind of within it there is

295
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,440
quite a strong kind of evidence and

296
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,070
evidence and habit needs-based movement

297
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,920
towards a more kind of granular and

298
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,650
respectful control over people's time

299
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,750
and attention and while I'm feeling

300
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,780
optimistic I like to imagine the next

301
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,770
generation of services in a sense

302
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,590
building in a respect for attention as a

303
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,750
fundamental aspect of UX you know I

304
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,630
don't I think we might be the

305
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,880
underpricing or mispricing of people's

306
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,040
attention might in retrospect look like

307
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,240
a folly or artifact over the last few

308
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,010
years rather than a permanent feature of

309
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,900
digital culture and of course the move

310
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,030
towards AI LED system smart systems

311
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,340
voice systems contextual worn systems

312
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,420
and so on and so on

313
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,180
is in many ways terrifying and

314
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,670
interesting but also geared towards

315
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,890
freeing up attention so that's a very

316
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,500
kind of nebulous answer but I think

317
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,790
there are a lot of interesting movements

318
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,600
to research and tap into and I'm quite

319
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,660
inspired by the opportunities that lie

320
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,180
in particular around parenting education

321
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,130
and employment because I think as they

322
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,180
did in the first Industrial Revolution

323
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,230
these

324
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,200
often help establish and enforce social

325
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,740
norms around a baseline expectation of

326
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,140
human thriving and human rights I think

327
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,630
we need one more question here in the

328
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,160
front

329
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,660
one more hi my name is Susan Bolton I

330
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,030
sent a question it seems like one of the

331
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,860
big barriers hearing this is that a lot

332
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,930
of this efficacy and data is getting

333
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,910
access to the data from the platforms

334
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,560
and listening to Facebook yesterday is

335
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,290
there any work potentially to take the

336
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,950
models fill that you're doing at Indiana

337
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,980
University and I know that sounds giving

338
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,630
that to Facebook so they can run they're

339
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,400
like helping the platforms run their own

340
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,140
analysis and then hopefully being

341
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,360
brought in like if they're afraid to let

342
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,780
the data go will they be able to bring

343
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,930
in some of the tools inside their own

344
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,300
platforms and at least they're starting

345
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,190
to understand I know they've got a lot

346
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,540
of smart people that work there too but

347
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,520
like yep they can at least begin to

348
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,410
understand the impact of what's

349
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,480
happening on their platforms better I I

350
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,400
think actually that has been the mode

351
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,180
for quite a long time their main way to

352
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,030
engaged Outsiders has to bring them in I

353
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,920
think that this has is problematic in

354
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,450
some sense in the first one is that it

355
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,760
all relies on networks of kunos whom I

356
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,950
have a good friend or my former students

357
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,690
are there so I have some access but

358
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,160
somebody else who might have a much

359
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,810
better idea than mine doesn't have

360
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,270
access that's one problem of bias and

361
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,520
other problem is that very often that we

362
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,380
the reason why they bring researchers in

363
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,570
is that then you sign a nondisclosure

364
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,580
agreement they give you a laptop you can

365
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,260
do everything you want and publisher the

366
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,980
conference perhaps but that data stays

367
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,360
in closed and they have to make sure

368
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,580
that okay so the new model with social

369
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,170
science one actually is an effort to

370
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,220
break that and to allow a broader

371
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,280
community of researchers to have access

372
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,530
to data we will see if it works or not I

373
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:17,190
have no idea but I mean at

374
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,250
so that's why I'm a little bit

375
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,240
pessimistic about what you suggest

376
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,010
because I think to some extent it it has

377
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,670
happened

378
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,160
they have no shortage of very very smart

379
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,320
people and researchers and also access

380
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,320
very easy access to the outside but

381
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,240
sometimes it's what they don't seek that

382
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,310
might be good and so so that's why you

383
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,840
know and and and people who don't have

384
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,400
those connections have a very hard time

385
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,300
to grab their attention so I think that

386
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,850
it is a good it is a step in the right

387
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,140
direction that Facebook is now

388
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,480
considering at least considering we'll

389
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,850
see how it well it works the idea of not

390
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,880
doing it by bringing people in by by by

391
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,030
allowing some data to some extent to be

392
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:06,720
shared more widely okay please join me

393
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,190
in thanking our tremendous speakers and
