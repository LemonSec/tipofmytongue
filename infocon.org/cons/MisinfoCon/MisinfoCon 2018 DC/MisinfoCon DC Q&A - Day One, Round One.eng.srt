1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,850
hi I'm Trevor Davis with counteraction

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,240
as the theme of today's session is about

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,950
international state disinformation

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,519
funded funded disinformation campaigns I

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,410
find it sort of curious the most of the

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,690
solutions that have seen out there are

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,630
are confined within the borders of

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,210
impacted countries and I'm concerned

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,529
that that slows the development of

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,560
consensus and proportional response that

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,769
underlies effective deterrence my

12
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,750
question which I guess all directive

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,030
lisa-marie it maria is so could you

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,520
explain what the role of east Stratcom

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,850
is what the failures have been and how

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,789
that relates to donate to individual

17
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,309
countries efforts in the EU and what

18
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,550
lessons does that have for the for

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,329
global the rest of us okay so I am not

20
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,610
fully an expert on EU regulation

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,530
specifically but it generally EU

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,359
regulation as all regulation is

23
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,800
incredibly slow and as you mentioned

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,739
it's very difficult to actually get a

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,850
moving consensus and I think the EU and

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,180
and specifically also the Stratcom have

27
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,009
been more about transparency about civil

28
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,570
engagement and they have been about

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,600
regulation so I think it was more about

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,119
educating citizen I think it was more

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,150
about debunking specific pieces of

32
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,560
disinformation and shedding light on

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,229
specific campaigns that being said I

34
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,240
think they have already done a lot of

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,790
the work in the countries where were no

36
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,500
sort of playbooks were really groomed

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
for the first time so for example when

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,220
we're looking at Estonia when we're

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,770
looking at the Ukraine those sort of a

40
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,210
books were being groomed for a really

41
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,770
long time they were already where

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,159
several strategies to sort of counter

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,500
them especially on a media literacy

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,229
level but I think the topic only then

45
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,509
got the attention that it deserved after

46
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,180
the 2016 elections and I think yes

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,100
you're right in your observation that

48
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,829
this this sort of knowledge transfer

49
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,290
happened really slowly or maybe did not

50
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,899
happen at all I think specifically also

51
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,640
on an EU level there were a lot of

52
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,569
different projects there were

53
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,280
a lot of different regulation efforts

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,170
that were not coordinated in many ways

55
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,060
and I think that is also one of the

56
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,060
baked reduce is thinking about okay can

57
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,239
we actually have some sort of government

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,450
agency or even some sort of body where

59
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,159
we can come together and have that

60
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,870
knowledge transfer where we come

61
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,719
together and have some sort of best

62
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,239
practices shared and have some sort of

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,530
yeah potential monitoring in a way that

64
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:54,549
is not only individual actors nature I

65
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,319
would just only only add on to that I

66
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,480
would say is that again we're trying to

67
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,310
get folks and what I think was your

68
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,870
question is a very good question is to

69
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,310
move outside of what I think country

70
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,859
based models to language based models so

71
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,269
we have to think about these as language

72
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,040
markets not country so it's not not I

73
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,870
think of this idea that the older models

74
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,150
like beaming in and out of a country and

75
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,530
so if you think about language and you

76
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,239
show the map on that which is something

77
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,709
we're doing now for our kind of

78
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,239
data-driven approach to reaching new

79
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,280
audiences it's really I think it's about

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,870
sort of languages and right because if

81
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,220
you think about top three languages

82
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,810
that's people speak so like a language

83
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,750
like Farsi actually there's it's it

84
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,040
there's hot spots all over the world

85
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,389
during the Middle East and Southeast

86
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,769
Asia and other places in terms of a

87
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,479
top-three language that people speak so

88
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,769
I think that also gets us out of that

89
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,340
conundrum

90
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,560
so I from the government's perspective I

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,849
that resonates that question a bit with

92
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,560
me I mean I think you view

93
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,419
misinformation operations as one

94
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:51,609
component of a number of ways a hostile

95
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,799
state might try to interfere with your

96
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:56,079
domestic affairs and so once you

97
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,189
categorize it as a national security

98
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:58,299
threat then the government should be

99
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:00,310
thinking about what tools we bring to

100
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,250
bear - as you put it deter and they

101
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,180
could be diplomatic

102
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,000
or it could be counter-messaging I don't

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,680
know there's so much for deterrence um

104
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,870
it could be sanctions so I agree with

105
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,370
you that from the government's

106
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,810
perspective what we're less involved I

107
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,019
think in the content space we should be

108
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,370
thinking about it as a national security

109
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,949
threat and that should be elevating it

110
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:25,889
to sort of state versus state problem

111
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,759
any other any other questions next

112
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,039
question Thank You Dwight thanks for

113
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,810
organizing just a really wonderfully

114
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,479
diverse kickoff to the to the

115
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,439
proceedings

116
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,789
thanks about today and tomorrow

117
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,770
I appreciated Adam

118
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,689
hickeys comment the historical

119
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,750
perspective on misinformation and

120
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,069
disinformation and I think it's

121
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,219
important to avoid making statements

122
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:08,020
about the recent events on social media

123
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,860
and the Internet as being a something

124
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,050
new this is this has been around for a

125
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,530
long time

126
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,009
it preceded social media and the

127
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,449
Internet and it's really important to

128
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,190
avoid making that if we're going to be

129
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,590
factual we need to stick to that

130
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,539
historical perspective it seems that the

131
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,009
solutions that we're talking about

132
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:32,889
everything that this conference is

133
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,020
organized around is a defensive posture

134
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,860
to the propaganda efforts of whatever

135
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,710
agency we're talking about be it Russia

136
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,520
or otherwise I'd be curious to get some

137
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,210
feedback as to how whether whether we

138
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,129
ought to also embark on kind of an

139
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,339
offensive approach the truth needs to be

140
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,690
pushed out there as well

141
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,259
we need campaigns that that advocate the

142
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,360
values and and and the facts that we

143
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,020
have at hand so I'd open that up to the

144
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,258
board

145
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,539
well I disagree I think that we that's

146
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,129
what we're doing we're actually out

147
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,020
there you know four thousand plus people

148
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,649
a day churning out you know hundreds of

149
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,929
hours of TV broadcast radio and digital

150
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,389
content in 58 languages reaching about

151
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,319
290 million people so I mean we want to

152
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,639
continue to double down on those

153
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,349
resources to sort of get to new we're

154
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,959
adding languages were we're becoming

155
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,429
more data-driven in terms of how we

156
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:41,319
think about audiences but I don't think

157
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,399
that's defensive at all

158
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,409
and I'd also and I know what you're

159
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,059
getting at because I when you say

160
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:47,889
campaigns it's really interesting I

161
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:49,059
think there's this is where the lines

162
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:51,279
blur a little bit campaigns is like what

163
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,110
I think of and I come from that area too

164
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,629
I used to work and and I lived in South

165
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,330
Asia and Islamabad and Kabul and in the

166
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,919
northwest frontier provinces for years

167
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,899
when we say campaigns I think we think

168
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,599
messaging like we have a message and

169
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,580
boom it's like we want to send it out to

170
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,729
people but in this decentralized

171
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,559
information environment messaging

172
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,360
doesn't work the same way right so when

173
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,729
you think about so so what we've done is

174
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,309
we've thought about content sort of a

175
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:20,740
little bit like swarm theory so you

176
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,959
think about enabling all of our

177
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,649
journalists to become sort of

178
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,399
independent purveyors of this

179
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,229
information right as they build their

180
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,029
own networks that's more authentic and

181
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:33,459
sort of ground up then sort of like as I

182
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:36,039
often times say look the best messaging

183
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,449
doesn't come from DC doesn't come from

184
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:39,369
my office all right it comes from the

185
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:41,979
field right and the field is out we're

186
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:44,079
in those language markets working with

187
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,749
local NGOs journalists and others to

188
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,429
build help build their ecosystem so a

189
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,769
short way of saying I think we're doing

190
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,259
it we're proactive about it we are doing

191
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:55,259
stuff that I think when we think about

192
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,610
adding new countries we're actually

193
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,499
looking at smaller languages we're on

194
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,179
the sort of like if I take polygraph

195
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,889
it's not just to respond to what

196
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,360
happened on the Kremlin disinformation

197
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,039
campaign but we want to get ahead of

198
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:08,349
that curve right because we want people

199
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:09,669
to give them the tools so that they can

200
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:15,279
assess information for themselves I also

201
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,629
want to add on that I want to add on the

202
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,829
first part where you said that

203
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,679
propaganda is also always very much a

204
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,839
reflection of history and is still very

205
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,449
much the same and I don't quite agree on

206
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,650
that point

207
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,140
so I do think yes propaganda is

208
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,700
something that we have had for a very

209
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,190
long time there's actually it dates back

210
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,409
apparently to Alexander the Great who is

211
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,240
often credited with the invention of

212
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,780
propaganda and I think many of those

213
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,390
basic techniques of appealing to emotion

214
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,670
are still in place but with social media

215
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,160
it's not just a evolution the logical

216
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,650
one of the next medium like it was from

217
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,230
newspaper to to me but it's really it's

218
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,360
a lot more truant that comes with it and

219
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
that is because it comes with automation

220
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,060
it comes with big data it comes with a

221
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,190
possibility to target people and it also

222
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,410
comes with a possibility to user

223
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,930
generate propaganda and so social media

224
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,570
has really democratized propaganda it's

225
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,510
not something anymore that is incredibly

226
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,250
expensive and that is only in the hands

227
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,560
of nation-states that put a lot of money

228
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,160
into it or any sort of corporate actors

229
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,370
but it's really something that is quite

230
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,340
accessible and you can have a very

231
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,680
sophisticated campaign that is where we

232
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,390
targeted where you have a lot of data

233
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,100
points and really custom-tailor

234
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,320
something to someone without having it

235
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,660
associated with a sort of costs that you

236
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,970
would have if you wanted to do a

237
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,100
propaganda campaign to reach 40 million

238
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:50,620
people 10 or 15 years ago so good

239
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,570
morning thank you for organizing this

240
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,770
panel my name is Adina

241
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,430
I'm with Storyful this question is to

242
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,370
miss the rest on and - sorry dr. Ulla I

243
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,230
would like to hear your opinion and this

244
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,660
we talked we compared it or you compared

245
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,350
it to the this whole the disinformation

246
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,440
campaigns to sort of part of or compared

247
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,440
to cyber warfare and in line of this I

248
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,730
want to ask have you encountered or do

249
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,500
you see campaigns the targeting not

250
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,960
polity sorry not political discussion or

251
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,610
those kind of things but more of

252
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,060
economic interest for example the energy

253
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,920
sector or preventing development of

254
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,560
energy sector or promoting something for

255
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,150
a

256
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,030
for the sake of country interests

257
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,620
another country a foreign country

258
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,660
interests we have seen energy industry

259
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,520
anti-fracking bots is a is a common one

260
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,790
probably the most common one its

261
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,570
attribution is of course very difficult

262
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,920
especially when you're on the outside

263
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,450
looking we don't have access to the

264
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,890
metadata behind the account creations

265
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,960
the device ID is so on and so forth what

266
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,510
we do see is throughout the presidential

267
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,190
campaign posts about fracking appearing

268
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,100
on candidate home pages so things that

269
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,510
were you would not necessarily think of

270
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,490
as a Republican position but basically

271
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,100
arguing vehemently against fracking

272
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,900
saying Hillary Clinton is for fracking

273
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,520
therefore we have to be against it and

274
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,890
so putting kind of a political spin on

275
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,660
that too and and these comments would be

276
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,550
posted verbatim over and over and over

277
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,140
and over again that's the kind of thing

278
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,400
you only get when you kind of look and

279
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,640
masse but we have no attribution there

280
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,740
the only thing we can say is given that

281
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,960
the IR it was active on those pages it

282
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,990
is not inconceivable to think that that

283
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,980
would have been one of the things that

284
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,570
they went after similarly we see this

285
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,060
with relation to GMOs also areas where

286
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,230
we believe that there's sort of a

287
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,670
strategic industry interest

288
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,120
so creating concern about GMOs creating

289
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,770
concern about fracking to push people

290
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,600
back towards oil we see those types of

291
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,400
narratives we believe that also there's

292
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,660
the potential to do things that

293
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,240
manipulate stock prices that target

294
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,910
companies directly we're seeing right

295
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,280
now a this is not Russia at all but the

296
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,500
real familiar with the semak's issue

297
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,300
that's happening right now good q and on

298
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,120
taking on sem x okay so that's another

299
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,740
example of how easy it is for a

300
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,330
corporation to get sucked into these

301
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,060
sorts of campaigns and and not really

302
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,680
have any recourse to do anything about

303
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,240
it

304
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,440
yeah i'll just add to what Renee said

305
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,050
simple answers yes I mean we see for

306
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,690
example in the Farsi language market you

307
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,860
know during the height of protests the

308
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,690
IRGC and Revolutionary Guard was really

309
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,750
focused on them because of the vast sort

310
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,100
of conglomerates that are associated

311
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,510
with you know in terms of the

312
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,370
pharmaceutical industry and others to

313
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,770
putting out information right in terms

314
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,260
of both potential partners of theirs but

315
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,840
they're trying to keep secured some of

316
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,490
the contracts that they had you know

317
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,030
with the opening of sort of trade

318
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,740
you find a lot like in the Turkish

319
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,720
language market right now in terms of

320
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,970
again conglomerates sort of business

321
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,650
kalam rates you had it around the press

322
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,200
media consolidation recently but you

323
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,900
also have key areas right in terms of

324
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,090
oil and gas that they're putting out so

325
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,980
yes I think as Renee said you're finding

326
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,260
a lot more of this and I think the parts

327
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,610
you mentioned that the manipulation of I

328
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,690
think is getting very interesting in

329
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,450
terms of when you think about domestic

330
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,940
stock markets and and and in terms of

331
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,070
out you know FDI investments that's

332
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,960
where I think it's gonna be particularly

333
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,400
you know apart from all the copyright

334
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,540
and we've talked a lot about that in

335
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,210
terms of intellectual property it time

336
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,770
for one or two more questions

337
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:37,710
hi Derek Johnson FCW over here hi so

338
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,210
this question is primarily directed for

339
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,920
for Adam but if anyone else wants to

340
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,960
take a crack at it be my guest

341
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,070
you know you had talked about the

342
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,710
government using transparency to sort of

343
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,080
expose and mitigate some of these

344
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,020
campaigns but as we know you know these

345
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,510
campaigns and operations by design latch

346
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,440
on to existing previously existing

347
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,120
political schisms within the American

348
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,490
political ecosystem right so you know

349
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,270
fracking and GMO are issues that existed

350
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,240
sort of before these campaigns went into

351
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,350
effect so how do you combat and expose

352
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,200
these campaigns without inadvertently

353
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,820
legitimizing some of these underlying

354
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,890
political debates and as an example you

355
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,890
see efforts in a outside of government

356
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,750
like the Hamilton sixty-eight dashboard

357
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,440
which have come under some criticism for

358
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,760
painting with too broad of a brush what

359
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,810
may or may not be a Russian troll backed

360
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,920
campaign so you know how do you wade

361
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,420
through that debate and sort of how do

362
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,010
you kind of thread that needle so to

363
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:54,450
speak how about this Oh

364
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,960
success

365
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,699
yeah I don't I don't mean to suggest the

366
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,339
government is likely or largely or

367
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,559
frequently going to be weighing in on

368
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,350
the truth particular argument or the

369
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,079
like in fact for the reasons I gave in

370
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,769
my remarks

371
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:12,869
there are a lot of reasons why we might

372
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:15,119
not do that and one of the principal

373
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:17,490
reasons is avoiding even the appearance

374
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,829
of partiality so if you're talking about

375
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,990
misinformation in the context of an

376
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,490
election that's going to be a situation

377
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,259
where we're going to be particularly

378
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,199
cautious on the other hand if you're

379
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,199
talking about misinformation that is

380
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,850
essentially lying about the government

381
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,800
itself so false information about where

382
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,920
to vote when to vote how to vote that is

383
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,139
something we may have a more it's

384
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,850
different from the narrative you've

385
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,379
described and it's something where we

386
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,269
have more of a or state government local

387
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,040
government might have a higher interest

388
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,529
in weighing in on what is false and what

389
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:51,600
is not so I think you've hit on a real

390
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
sensitivity and that's why I don't think

391
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,749
it's going to be us a lot of the time

392
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:57,899
saying what is right or wrong though we

393
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,019
have a role in saying hey provider I

394
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,699
don't know if you know this or not but

395
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,009
this network of pages here is connected

396
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,740
and here's some information about who

397
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,149
might be behind them and it's not

398
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,839
necessarily folks who live here so that

399
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,339
I think is more likely to be the space

400
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,249
in which we play that makes sense

401
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:19,139
can we we've time for one more question

402
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:29,459
one more hello so my question is for our

403
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:33,559
own Lisa Marie Rene I'm curious about

404
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,259
the extent to which you try to bring

405
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,449
people on the right or on the far right

406
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,850
the conservative into the discussion on

407
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,759
fighting misinformation I tend to

408
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,230
observe that it seems to be often a left

409
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,299
oriented issue and I'm really curious

410
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:53,910
what your experience has been if that's

411
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,799
something you've tried to do what are

412
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,449
the kind of folks that you engage with

413
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,579
so if you can comment on that that would

414
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,559
be really helpful could you also please

415
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,509
identify yourself sure my name is Gleb

416
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:04,919
supporter scam with the Perot truth

417
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,220
pledge

418
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,549
so one of the things that we talk about

419
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:14,589
a lot of new knowledge is this is not a

420
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,019
partisan issue and as we saw with the

421
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:18,999
IRA in particular the right on the Left

422
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,309
were targeted we don't see that we don't

423
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:22,539
believe that turning this into a

424
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:27,279
partisan issue benefits anyone specifics

425
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,200
I mean I have been to a number of events

426
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,350
where you know particularly one of the

427
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,960
medics where there was some kind of all

428
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,919
right

429
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,279
you know pro-trump let's say supporters

430
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,690
who were in the room discussing what

431
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,490
they saw mimetic tactics NATO was kind

432
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,929
of studying memes for a while at

433
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:48,879
strathcom this came up in the context of

434
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:52,059
that so there is input I think a lot of

435
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:55,259
people do unify around the

436
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,419
acknowledgment that the Russia influence

437
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:01,179
campaign happened and those who can

438
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,279
start at that you know from from that

439
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,070
shared basis in fact can actually work

440
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:13,149
together to come up with a solution yeah

441
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:15,639
so to clarify our role a little bit and

442
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:18,220
how our project is looking into that we

443
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,710
are mainly concerned with providing the

444
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,379
research and not so much actually you

445
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:25,809
have a specific agenda or have a

446
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,470
specific civil civil engagement strategy

447
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,320
that we're pursuing as well but I think

448
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,990
one of the policies that we sort of have

449
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,369
is we want to help different people in

450
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,320
the industry whether it's regulators

451
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,789
whether it's social media companies

452
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,639
whether it's journalists to have the

453
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:48,850
knowledge to ask the right questions and

454
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,980
so I think in how we're trying to

455
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,499
provide that knowledge is very much in a

456
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,929
research style a matter which is factual

457
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:01,269
and which is neutral well add one more

458
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:02,440
thing really quickly I hope no one gets

459
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,119
mad at me for saying this in San

460
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,549
Francisco on September 22nd data for

461
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,860
democracy is co-sponsoring an event with

462
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,759
Lincoln labs which is a

463
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,679
republican-leaning tech organization

464
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,450
where we're bringing a bunch of folks

465
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,369
out from DC and having a conversation

466
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,549
about quantifying harms regulation so on

467
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:20,230
and so forth and it's all the part that

468
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,700
all the panels are extra

469
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,870
we bipartisan and I would encourage

470
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,130
anyone who wants to hear the right-wing

471
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,690
perspective who happens to be NSF to

472
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,620
