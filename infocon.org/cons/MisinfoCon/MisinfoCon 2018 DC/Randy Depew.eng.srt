1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,230
hey everybody this is great I work KQED

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,720
which is public NPR affiliate and PBS

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,480
affiliate in San Francisco and I'm part

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,920
of our education department I'm here to

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,830
talk about mostly solution-based stuff

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,380
but I hopefully will have some time to

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,550
weigh in on some of these other issues

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,029
at the end which are foundational to the

9
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,460
work that we're doing so I'm here to

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,590
talk about a solution for a product that

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,720
we've developed called KQED learn which

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,369
is an online space for student inquiry

13
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,890
and collaboration connecting students

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,870
connecting secondary classrooms middle

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,579
and high school classrooms across the

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,290
country around issues and questions that

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,809
matter to them so KQED learn is a free

18
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,390
platform for hosting and supporting

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,280
student inquiry investigation and media

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,399
making classrooms as they engage and ask

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,219
questions as they conduct inquiry and

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,320
investigations as they make and share

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,469
findings and multimedia formats

24
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,309
fostering connections and collaborations

25
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,580
between individuals and community and

26
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,040
finding an audience for great student

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,070
work at KQED the foundation of our work

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,720
is about elevating youth voice from the

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,030
classroom to our national conversations

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,090
we believe that teenagers should be

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,520
heard and in order for teenagers to be

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,670
heard we need to develop the tools and

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,979
platforms for them to be heard on so

34
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,909
what we do is we're going to work on

35
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,210
providing them framework and resources

36
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,009
to refine their voice and engaged in

37
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,600
informed discussion conduct their own

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,909
inquiry and produce stories that matter

39
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,220
to them and their communities and to

40
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,790
share their work with peers and more

41
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,850
there's a word missing it's widely I do

42
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,409
promise that while these are easy to

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,119
read I have I did get the memo and I

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,920
have several slides that you will not be

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,899
able to read later on so you know at the

46
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,759
root of the problem that we see it is is

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,979
inquiry or rather the failure to

48
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,709
adequately promote inquiry has led to a

49
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,690
generation or maybe generations of

50
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,860
people waiting to

51
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,030
told what matters and why as Haroon from

52
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,370
BBG said yesterday and it was also kind

53
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,750
of brought up today in a different way

54
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,330
this information is ineffective against

55
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,850
a well-educated informed citizenry and

56
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,390
maybe we think that in nurturing

57
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,060
curiosity and an inquiry mindset is part

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,340
of that equation so the first part of

59
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,020
our learn experience is called go above

60
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,450
the noise this is a series that we

61
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,340
produce at KQED that seeks to spark

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,110
civic engagement and informed debate

63
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,060
about issues that are relevant to youth

64
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,550
in their community we have a young

65
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,090
journalist who hosts our show we are

66
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,940
hyped on the animation and what we do in

67
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,450
this series is we we really bring topics

68
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,670
that we think kids are going to be

69
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,830
interested in as well as we have to find

70
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,050
this balance of stuff that teachers are

71
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,870
also interested in engaging in

72
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,459
discussions with their students and

73
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,670
through the series we model inquiry by

74
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,880
asking critical questions and

75
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,110
investigating answers of producing and

76
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,910
looking at things from multiple

77
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,000
perspectives talking about why sources

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,940
are good sources why sources or not and

79
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,670
then through the end what miles does is

80
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,459
guides people miles as the host what

81
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,380
miles does is guides students through

82
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,410
the process so that as he's learning

83
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,840
he's modeling what kinds of questions

84
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,690
and activities they should ask and then

85
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,590
we invite kids into discussion so this

86
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,140
is a national conversation and here's a

87
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,580
my first slide that you won't be able to

88
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,850
read so this is a good one good place

89
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,170
for us to go on here so what I'm gonna

90
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,900
do is I'm gonna I'm gonna paraphrase

91
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,239
some of this so this is a discussion

92
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,480
around free speech on college campuses

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,580
its stemmed from an episode we did about

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,130
the issues that happened at UC Berkeley

95
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,500
with Milo don't know his last name and

96
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,238
some of the other guys that are part of

97
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,620
his troop so this is for responses from

98
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,440
three schools around the country

99
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,880
two of them are in the Bay Area one of

100
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,330
them is in

101
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,430
Los Angeles and the other one is a

102
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,039
student from Quantico here in Virginia

103
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,900
and the first kid starts with a

104
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,759
provocation he says the presence of hate

105
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,800
speech and the Constitution's inability

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,550
to stop it

107
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,030
throws the whole thing into question 231

108
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,969
years it's too old it's too white right

109
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,740
the second kid says get a grip you're

110
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,389
wrong there's no expiration date on the

111
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,900
Constitution third kid says well I agree

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,669
that the Constitution is important but

113
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,590
he might have a point we do need to

114
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,150
think about this hate speech thing and

115
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,490
then the fourth student who's a middle

116
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,800
schooler from Virginia says sorry but we

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,930
need to protect all speech even hate

118
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,569
hate speech is ridiculous she does note

119
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,000
but if we stop protecting it then all of

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,889
our rights become vulnerable so we have

121
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,750
this wrecked kind of rich conversation

122
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,639
happening with students in urban

123
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,620
environments students across the country

124
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,409
students across grade levels that we're

125
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:25,879
really kind of excited about so after we

126
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,229
after students engage in this kind of

127
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:29,909
discussion they start to find their

128
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,740
voice they start to learn how to cite

129
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,349
resources from the how to build that

130
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,300
kind of into their natural language as

131
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,770
they're writing about the things that

132
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,229
they're thinking we then open it up for

133
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:42,750
questions to students we start providing

134
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,940
learning resources at the point of need

135
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,150
so as along with asking questions the

136
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,589
point where students begin to ask

137
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,810
questions again another slide you can't

138
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,620
read and ironically I can't either

139
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,099
so but we start providing just the weird

140
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,139
you know bifocals don't work I don't

141
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,909
know who where if anyone wears them and

142
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,229
they work tell me about it because they

143
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,740
just don't so our thing is you know what

144
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,080
we we then provide solution or sources

145
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,120
with other KQED media professionals

146
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,400
answering questions like what kind of

147
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,469
questions are there and how do I ask a

148
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:18,150
good question so we have media

149
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,560
personalities talking about well in the

150
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,020
show that I do or as a reporter and we

151
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,729
model those kinds of things throughout

152
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,699
this process then we get into our

153
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,589
investigations process our inquiry

154
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,569
process which is focused on four main

155
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:32,819
steps questioning investigating making

156
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,050
and sharing and reflecting and

157
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,120
responding to others I've pulled out a

158
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,560
little piece here this is from an

159
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,599
investigation on nuclear power that

160
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,419
spawned four

161
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,669
there was a an icon on the earlier slide

162
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,770
about nuclear power and one of the

163
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,169
videos we did this investigation has

164
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:50,659
four different schools seventy five

165
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:54,110
different participants they're sharing

166
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,959
19 different internet resources and

167
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,300
they've produced 61 different pieces of

168
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,649
media as a result of their

169
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:02,659
investigations there's a few of the kids

170
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:09,490
at the top of the list three minutes

171
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,539
okay so you're we have oh I gotta push

172
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,019
this and this here's this so at the

173
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,490
first stage we ask kids what they

174
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,869
already know so right you know if you're

175
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:23,599
a teacher you know about like KWL charts

176
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,189
and all kinds of things and activating

177
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:27,289
prior learning so we say before they

178
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:28,849
start doing the investigation what do

179
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,249
you already know about nuclear power

180
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,569
sometimes they're wrong sometimes they

181
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:33,919
don't know anything sometimes they're

182
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,809
right but the point is they can start to

183
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,759
see that what other kids are thinking

184
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,339
before they begin the process once they

185
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,729
begin the process they move into an

186
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,519
investigation stage here again I've told

187
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,169
you I promise slides you couldn't read I

188
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,029
am delivering on that promise

189
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,519
the investigation stage students can

190
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,249
rate share rate and discuss resources

191
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,649
and see the ways that others are valuing

192
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:00,529
or not valuing those same resources so

193
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,119
in this case here's one of the resources

194
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:04,339
on the top and you have in this

195
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:06,110
particular case there are 18 different

196
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,289
comments on this resource the resources

197
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,059
received oh it's a good one it's

198
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,490
received a great rating so you can see

199
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,409
down here students are like what are

200
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,779
they why I think this is a good resource

201
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,029
other students can start to see what

202
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:24,289
other kids are thinking then we move

203
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,319
into making and sharing media content so

204
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,360
at this point we bring we wrap it all

205
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,999
together at the beginning their initial

206
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,068
thought lays in the top so they can see

207
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,958
it they're caught so it's there they're

208
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,208
learning becomes presented in context

209
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,549
they can see where I was where I am we

210
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,620
roll in the citations on the right of

211
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,930
the articles or the resources that they

212
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,269
have cited as part of their research and

213
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,519
then the students share this content

214
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,769
reflect on it and then invite other

215
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:53,870
students to respond to their work as

216
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,959
well

217
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,990
so I mentioned earlier that we are

218
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,930
involved in elevating youth voice and

219
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,509
all of this is our attempt to get

220
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:08,809
students making amazing media becoming

221
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:12,470
literate and making positive

222
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,170
contributions and becoming civically

223
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,720
engaged in the spring of this year we

224
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,179
sponsored we decided to test the

225
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,189
hypothesis of whether students could

226
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:24,470
actually make media that our producers

227
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,379
would put on the radio our producers

228
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:30,259
didn't think that we could but we tried

229
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:32,839
it we ended up working with ten students

230
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,490
in kind of a rapid-fire prototype

231
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,639
session to see ten teachers excuse me in

232
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,259
a prototype and over about eight weeks

233
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,079
we ended up with 35 after eight weeks we

234
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:43,939
ended up with 35 students on the air

235
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:47,179
producing stories live on KQED radio

236
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:50,149
reaching an audience of about 250,000

237
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,050
people a day and then 75 more stories

238
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,990
published on KQED org our website which

239
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,209
is also viewed millions of times a month

240
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,999
how much for 30 seconds Phil I'm just

241
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:07,279
kidding okay so I had a bunch of stuff

242
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,259
but I do want to do one more slide and

243
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,240
this is just this is the way we define

244
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,470
this conversation that's come up a few

245
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,300
different times today it's skepticism

246
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,459
versus cynicism and I think I haven't

247
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,259
heard the word cynic but I think that

248
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:19,429
that's what we're talking about is the

249
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:21,079
cynic just trusts everything and the

250
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,679
skeptic kind of thinks about the things

251
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,920
and and questions and learns the

252
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,170
question as part of the process and then

253
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,059
you know we do we have some other

254
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:32,990
justifications

255
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,610
I'll show you slides later if you want

256
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,610
Thanks

257
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,069
[Applause]
