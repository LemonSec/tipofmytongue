1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970
thank you yes hi I'm Phil Mansur from

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,040
Indiana University I have a question for

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,400
Jessica you said that you remove enough

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,769
antique accounts do you do anything

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,639
similar to that for pages because pages

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,870
you know anybody can create a page and

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,359
anybody can be behind it and we find

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,890
that there used to spread a lot of

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,720
misinformation you talked about content

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,390
but not the actual pages themselves and

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,939
if you and and relate it to that is

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,099
there any plan to make data from pages

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,779
easily available for research for

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,030
example through an API so that people

15
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,430
could study how pages are used to spread

16
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,559
various kinds of misinformation can

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,390
folks hear me okay perfect

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,820
great question so the answer to the

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,070
first part of the question is is yes so

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,670
when pages have admins or administrators

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,320
when we find that those accounts are

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,649
false the page will then come down so so

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,329
so we look at the accounts behind the

24
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,699
page in terms of making data available

25
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,280
as I mentioned we're always looking for

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,930
ways to be more transparent about our

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,159
efforts and ways that we can you know

28
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,930
make make more information available to

29
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,790
support those kinds of efforts so it's

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,140
kind of something that's ongoing and

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,259
we're continuing to think about other

32
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,250
questions hi I'm Joe sparks and I'm a

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,280
freelancer my question is do you have

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,850
any real-time tools to do this and how

35
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,979
fast does it happen because I would

36
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,659
assume the faster you can quash

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,689
something the less effective it would be

38
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,960
so can any of the first three speakers

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,360
please comment on that I can't is this

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,170
one yeah so speed is not something

41
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,930
academics are known for unfortunately

42
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,090
you know I got the the NBC data set

43
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,829
drops on Valentine's Day of this year

44
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,570
and I managed to get an analysis out

45
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,490
about six weeks later which is like

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,380
light speed in like academic terms and

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,509
so I think that you know the trade-off

48
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,360
is always you know speed and quality

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,758
right so the faster you do something the

50
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,330
less quality is going to be to it now I

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,860
would I would direct

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,100
- there is an ongoing project that's

53
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,540
like I'm spacing on the name it

54
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,160
probably's people the know in the room

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,210
know what it is but it's funded by the

56
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,410
German Marshall Fund and they're trying

57
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,420
to track a number of Russian

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,340
disinformation agents the issue is they

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,250
won't tell you who they are because the

60
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,720
analysis basically assumes that if we

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,010
tell you who they are if they tell us

62
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,020
who they are then that sort of causes

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,340
them to scatter and do all these sorts

64
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,920
of things and so I really it's called

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,960
the to something project never what it

66
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,790
is but somebody somebody know what I'm

67
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,240
talking about this thing is yeah it's

68
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,310
called Hamilton 68 thank you so much and

69
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,600
so they are trying this sort of

70
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,740
real-time thing but there are some

71
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,720
limitations chief among them that they

72
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,160
can't tell you who the actual accounts

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,490
are so next question cover there the

74
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,910
back hi my name is Justin let me I'm

75
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,300
with my computer my name is Justin

76
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,440
Lippmann with George Washington

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,680
University the tweets in the NBC data

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,020
set that Dean reference were provided to

79
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,080
NBC by anonymous sources well there may

80
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,970
be other reasons one of the reasons that

81
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,650
the sources were anonymous is because

82
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,360
sharing the tweets violates Twitter's

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,330
policies similarly Facebook has created

84
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,830
a public database of political ads

85
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,930
however that database is designed for

86
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,670
individual queries rather than

87
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,010
large-scale studies so my question is

88
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,959
what obligation does social media

89
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,760
platforms have to support the study of

90
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,709
disinformation whether it be through

91
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,080
their policies or through the

92
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,130
infrastructure they support for

93
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,730
transparency

94
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,140
well I back to keep them happy to give

95
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,010
you my opinion I think that they

96
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,989
absolutely are obligated I think that um

97
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,650
you know when you're studying something

98
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,420
that has been that has as much

99
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,000
acknowledged as importance as a

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,940
deceleration and misinformation do not

101
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,560
only by people in this room but also by

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,510
people who are very high up in the US

103
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,090
government I you know I've advanced what

104
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,549
I call a Public Interest rationale right

105
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,820
and violating some social media

106
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,620
companies Terms of Service to be able to

107
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,570
study this content if you think if you

108
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,430
consider the alternative of not doing so

109
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,839
and not understanding what's going to

110
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,370
happen right when you've got you know

111
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,780
the Director of National Intelligence

112
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,490
telling us the IRA is at it again

113
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,930
you know I think that that you know I'm

114
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,220
willing I mean I have tenure right so

115
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,599
I'm willing to take the hit on that you

116
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:34,539
know what I mean so I'm okay with that

117
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,389
and I'm okay saying it publicly and I

118
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,710
think I think more people should to do

119
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,310
so honestly and from the Facebook

120
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,440
perspective as I mentioned we are always

121
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,180
looking at ways that we can be more

122
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,500
transparent and I know on the

123
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,539
misinformation side for example we're

124
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,720
partnering with a commission to study

125
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,949
misinformation and the role in elections

126
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:56,289
and partnering very closely with

127
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,210
academics and sharing data for that

128
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,560
purpose and so I think we're making

129
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,919
progress in this area and you know it's

130
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,419
always a balance and we're trying to

131
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,120
just strike the right balance can I can

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,530
I just add something I mean just

133
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,789
building just building on those points

134
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,080
if I look at the work that we're trying

135
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,659
to do I know that Facebook has rolled

136
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:19,960
out the fact-checking to videos and

137
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,460
images and was looking at the detailed

138
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,870
day announces a couple of months ago

139
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,759
this is now being rolled out in four

140
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,490
different countries and of course as an

141
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,039
academic that's exactly the data that we

142
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,729
would love to get access to in terms of

143
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:34,960
the next phase of the research that

144
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,690
we're doing around images and so where

145
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,110
maybe there are natural logical next

146
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,360
steps in terms of what have we been able

147
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,639
to find out from the data that we've

148
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,979
sort of painstakingly put together so

149
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,400
this is data that we're using that is

150
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,199
essentially the end result of two other

151
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,599
projects where the data wasn't used

152
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:59,500
further but that's only 95 image case

153
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,849
studies that we have that's a really

154
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:03,370
really small database if we could get

155
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,349
access to a much larger database to

156
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,479
actually see what is happening and I

157
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,099
know that that would only be on one

158
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,699
platform but these are the these are

159
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,409
difficulties and so yes I know that

160
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,330
there are different academic you know

161
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,430
partnerships happening Twitter's had the

162
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,900
data grants and then they didn't have

163
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,500
them but I think this is where research

164
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,409
really is hampered where there is a will

165
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:29,380
and a desire and you know kind of

166
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,250
backing onto what Dean was saying you

167
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,430
know academics willing to you know not

168
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,039
necessarily risk careers but to do

169
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,900
things kind of for the for the public

170
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,300
good

171
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,640
and and if that's hampered then you know

172
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,440
I don't I don't know anybody else who is

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,120
so obsessed we're trying to understand

174
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,440
images when it comes to missing this

175
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,970
information then the group of

176
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,500
researchers that you know we've got in

177
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,940
the lab but I think these things really

178
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,940
really matter so I do hope that these

179
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,130
kinds of initiatives partnering with

180
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,370
academics are there for those right

181
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,280
reasons and not for kind of PR purposes

182
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,430
because the company is on the back foot

183
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,230
understandably but I just really want to

184
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,510
just absolutely stress that I hope that

185
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,970
those partnerships then are sustainable

186
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,630
that they also embrace the stuff that

187
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,790
isn't necessarily in the best interest

188
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,980
of the company in terms of findings

189
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,200
because this is where I feared these

190
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,510
kinds of partnerships then won't

191
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,250
necessarily see the light of day in

192
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,320
terms of the results so it's just a

193
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,200
public plea really to say when we when

194
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,120
we try and work together let's try and

195
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,530
do that really for the right reasons and

196
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,690
as publicly and transparently and openly

197
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,250
as possible because I think there is a

198
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:47,270
lot at stake Thanks question back there

199
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,070
all right Roman GDIT

200
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,110
I had two questions the first is for

201
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,060
Farida it's pretty trivial in any of the

202
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,130
95 images that you studied did you find

203
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,530
any evidence of steganography and the

204
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,710
second question is for Jessica and that

205
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,810
is through the process of the identify

206
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,970
review remove have you found that had

207
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,160
any kind of appreciable impact on user

208
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,510
engagement with that content so do you

209
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,460
mean things that we're hiding in plain

210
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,950
sight what yes ma'am

211
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,930
can you elaborate a little bit what

212
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,220
kinds of things are you thinking about

213
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,250
so so a typical example of steganography

214
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,490
would be embedding information regarding

215
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,810
command and control infrastructure

216
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:33,200
typically be used for malware I think

217
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,760
you need to elaborate a little bit more

218
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,210
again we might think this conversation

219
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,430
not that I can think of the top of my

220
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,640
mind where we have been conscious that

221
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,230
that is what's happening I think what we

222
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,360
have found as I've spoken about is where

223
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,060
you find out what the message was much

224
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,940
much later so in terms of you know what

225
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,650
can you do in real time or you know the

226
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,810
kind of the time element I think these

227
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,090
are the kinds of things or the kinds of

228
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,090
input that we would value tremendously

229
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,830
and potentially work with other people

230
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,750
like yourself if there is that level of

231
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,850
expertise out there that can bring

232
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,580
another layer of analysis to the data

233
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,530
because we don't necessarily have that

234
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,660
expertise right and I think this is why

235
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,180
images are so incredibly tricky so we

236
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,820
have worked and we are working with

237
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,950
people who have an expertise in meme

238
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,840
research for example there's issues

239
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,970
around intergenerational reading of

240
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,340
images right so a lot of memes are based

241
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,160
on friends or the matrix I show this to

242
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,150
my students and they're like who's

243
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,770
Murphy is I have no idea what's going on

244
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,640
here so there are enormous issues with

245
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,470
the reading of visual material and if

246
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,780
you add this layer of complexity to it

247
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,610
as well then I think we also I think

248
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,770
need to be better at recognizing the

249
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,240
limitations of the knowledge that we

250
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,640
have when we come to analyzing these

251
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,040
kinds of datasets and then if there are

252
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,200
additional communities that have that

253
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,990
knowledge to look again at those images

254
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,310
maybe we will find another layer that

255
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,170
that's also been hidden from us so I

256
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,340
think it's a really good point

257
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,840
and I think it's definitely something

258
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,490
that we should look into and it's not

259
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,970
something that pops out as yes we have

260
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,740
you no clear-cut examples of that so

261
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,340
thank you very much for your feedback on

262
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,070
your second question so I think I'd

263
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,500
mentioned earlier that we do see if an

264
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,750
article is met is rated false by our

265
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,060
fact checkers we do see engagement with

266
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,340
that article decreased substantially so

267
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,450
we reduce future views by by 80% and

268
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,700
another another item that it's it was

269
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,700
interesting for me and before I took

270
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,520
over the portfolio

271
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,850
we had been marking articles marked fall

272
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,529
that were rated false by fact-checkers

273
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,110
with a disputed flag so something that

274
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,670
would like a clearly visible sort of

275
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,380
ticker that would show people that that

276
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,820
the article had been had been fact

277
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,010
checked and marked false and we actually

278
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,050
had research showing that users ended up

279
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,970
engaging more with that content in fact

280
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,950
they were it was like it was entrenching

281
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,810
more deeply entrenching their feelings

282
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,870
about the content and so we ended up as

283
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,850
I said where our policies are changing

284
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,380
we're always iterating that's when we

285
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,570
transition to related articles because

286
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,279
we found that showing more contacts to

287
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,770
people it's actually more effective than

288
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,690
simply you know tagging an article as

289
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,170
potentially false or misleading we've

290
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,820
time for one or two more questions

291
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,770
before bring for lunch go ahead hi this

292
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,360
is Jeff and Wes from University of

293
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,220
Washington and just back to Jessica that

294
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,140
80% number that you mentioned I think is

295
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,510
that it's a great number to talk about

296
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,940
but from our work we've done we find

297
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,110
it's really hard to establish a

298
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,029
counterfactual compared to what 80

299
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,800
percent to what you would expect given

300
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,270
the same number of counts number of

301
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,550
shares what what I'm hearing these

302
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,649
numbers a lot not just from Facebook but

303
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,180
others that we're seeing these big drops

304
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,550
but compared to what what can we use is

305
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,410
our you know our established baseline

306
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,700
and is there a way that we could have

307
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,649
sort of a common language so that when

308
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:07,850
we hear those numbers we can better

309
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,459
understand what improvement really is is

310
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,910
occurring it's a fair question and my

311
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,620
understanding is it's based it's it's

312
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,220
compared to it really it's the I suppose

313
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,500
its future use I don't actually the

314
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,880
answer is unfortunately I don't know

315
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,440
this is these are numbers that we run

316
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,029
through our data scientists so I'll have

317
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:28,040
to get back to you in terms of

318
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,600
methodology but it's a fair point and

319
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,790
totally understood that the numbers you

320
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,290
know of explaining the rationale behind

321
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,360
them would be would be helpful last

322
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,149
question good

323
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,439
Myles Smith from inter news it strikes

324
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:48,540
me that the previous conversation with

325
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,619
the official from the Department of

326
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,749
Justice mentioned that the u.s. policy

327
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:53,879
response to this is based on

328
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,299
transparency and a pitiless public yet

329
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,939
on we're also hearing from Facebook is

330
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:02,759
that we should trust Facebook to change

331
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,869
its algorithm itself within its own

332
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:11,040
company to improve the sort of quality

333
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,139
of information on its platform it seems

334
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,399
like those two things are incongruent

335
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,100
the expectation for transparency from

336
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,290
the government side with expectation

337
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,459
from Facebook that they'd be able to

338
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,869
handle it internally and I wonder if

339
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:26,850
you'd comment on that I don't think it's

340
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,489
incongruent actually I think that

341
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:33,439
Facebook you know although we have been

342
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,879
developing and imposing our own sort of

343
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,129
policies to address this issue I think

344
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,829
transparency is a goal it's something we

345
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:43,079
are striving towards both in terms of

346
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,429
making data public making our approach

347
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,829
public making change the changes that we

348
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:49,379
make public as well and so I actually

349
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,899
think that the two the two approaches

350
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,819
are complementary I think we read one

351
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,709
more back in the corner one more thank

352
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:00,360
you Elias Crowell American foreign

353
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,559
policy magazine Jessica I wanted to

354
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,739
follow up with you on the question of

355
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:06,059
transparency and data piggybacking what

356
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:09,299
Renee was talking about this morning one

357
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,369
of the key pieces of data that Facebook

358
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,139
is sitting on that it hasn't released is

359
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,769
the engagement data on IR a campaign I'm

360
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:18,540
wondering that is in the 2016 election

361
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,589
I'm wondering if you can elaborate on

362
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,069
why Facebook hasn't released that data

363
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,739
and whether there's any conversations

364
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,929
within the company to make a more public

365
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:31,350
accounting of what that data looks like

366
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,199
to perhaps be able to measure what the

367
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,769
impact of that campaign looks like I

368
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,759
unfortunately don't know the answer to

369
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,949
that question so I'm on the

370
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:43,559
misinformation policy team focusing on

371
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,850
things like our third-party

372
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,319
fact-checking program and so there are

373
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,259
teams dedicated more to our information

374
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,360
operations work and they perhaps would

375
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,039
be better situated to answer so I'm

376
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,539
happy to follow up with you after and

377
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,129
get your card and have someone follow up

378
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:56,940
with you on that

379
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,900
I actually do know the answer this

380
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,800
question so Facebook is Facebook is

381
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,550
cooperating with initiative called

382
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,870
social science one in which they're

383
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,080
making a number of data collections

384
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,700
available to researchers to study one of

385
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,160
those is a set of URLs have been posted

386
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,620
like the floor has to have been posted

387
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,720
at least 20 times and they're doing that

388
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,640
over the past couple of years and

389
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,160
they're gonna make that available to the

390
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,840
data scientists to analyze and

391
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,470
presumably any IRA related URL that was

392
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,570
posted at least 20 times we part our

393
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,710
dataset and that includes things like

394
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,860
engagement some aggregate demographics

395
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,360
of people who shared it and that sort of

396
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,010
things so conceivably if there were

397
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,600
projects that were directed specifically

398
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,370
at the IRA and looking at the are the

399
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,930
Gil rels are they shared you'd be able

400
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,500
to get at least some of it through that

401
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,270
that please join me in thanking our

402
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,790
tremendous second phase of lightning

403
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,730
speakers really fantastic thank you guys

404
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,530
