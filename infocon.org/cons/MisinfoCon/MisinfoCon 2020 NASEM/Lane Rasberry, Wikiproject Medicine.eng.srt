1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
so this is your guys free pass we're

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,360
past time if you need to leave the room

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,980
feel free I won't be offended I'm gonna

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,049
be talking about Wikipedia in general

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,400
terms we've talked a lot about

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,750
misinformation I'm certainly going to be

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,070
talking about misinformation as well

8
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,620
it's also my belief that wikipedia is

9
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,849
part of these solutions and

10
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,470
misinformation particularly I'm going to

11
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,109
be talking about Wikipedia as medical

12
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,699
content how do you do my name is Lane

13
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,590
raspberry I'm staff Wikimedia and also

14
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,689
known as we comedian and residence at

15
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,010
the school of data science at the

16
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,019
University of Virginia my own personal

17
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,269
agenda for this talk so there is the

18
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,289
content that I'm going to be covering

19
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,329
but I would like for any of you to feel

20
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,059
welcome and invited to edit Wikipedia as

21
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,430
you like if you don't feel so bold as to

22
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,010
edit Wikipedia then feel confident that

23
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,719
after the after hearing this talk that

24
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,969
you should be able to explain Wikipedia

25
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,379
with your friends and colleagues over

26
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,690
coffee that's good enough the reason why

27
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,520
anyone should care about Wikipedia is

28
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,440
that it's popular there's a very simple

29
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,480
reason why we Kapiti as popular it's

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,910
because the search engines will return

31
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,210
any query for which there is a Wikipedia

32
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,609
article covering that topic to Wikipedia

33
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,530
since 2001 Google's been directing

34
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,689
traffic to Wikipedia being DuckDuckGo

35
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,060
the rest of them do that as well

36
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,650
Wikipedia's traffic and all sorts of

37
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,180
metrics about Wikipedia as public it's a

38
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,130
non-profit free and open project we

39
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,020
collect all the metrics for this and

40
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,450
just the slice of Wikipedia talking

41
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,950
about English Wikipedia which covers

42
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,220
medicine it gets about 200 million page

43
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,320
views in every month that means if

44
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,210
you're charged with trying to distribute

45
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,070
or disseminate medical information and

46
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,600
you put it in Wikipedia you're going to

47
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,400
reach an audience that is absolutely

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,590
large not only is it absolutely large

49
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,170
it's also relatively large as compared

50
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,909
to other sources of medical information

51
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,680
we've been tracking what other websites

52
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,689
do to distribute medical information

53
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,119
apparently lists I've got NIH WebMD Mayo

54
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,759
Clinic National Health Service w-h-o in

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,110
up-to-date a service for medical

56
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,880
students we also track the CDC which

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,070
doesn't make it on this list Wikipedia

58
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,079
it has been for about ten years more

59
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,180
popular than any of those in the past

60
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,619
year things have changed the media

61
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,450
landscape is changing rapidly there's a

62
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,790
lot more automated in artificial

63
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,130
intelligence producing content it's

64
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,750
changing the nature of how people

65
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,500
consume media that

66
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,149
okay even if we Kapiti us not be most

67
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:11,530
consulted source of information as

68
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,150
compared to all other websites it's

69
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,130
still extremely popular and it's worth a

70
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,050
lot of people's time I'm gonna ask you a

71

all of them wikipedia BBC for the

86
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,600
american and the UK piratebay very

87
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,890
important non-profit website Mozilla

88
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,989
this is for downloading Firefox browser

89
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:04,870
in IH for downloading PubMed papers the

90
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,370
Internet Archive which really is like

91
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,930
Wikipedia the US Postal Service in

92
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,610
wordpress.org that's not wordpress.com

93
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,900
that's not the actual blogs

94
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,209
that's WordPress software every other

95
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,580
website in the top 500 is either trying

96
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,150
to sell you something or sell sells

97
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,410
something to you or sell you something

98
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,900
it works Eve either way so what is

99
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,730
Wikipedia Wikipedia is an encyclopedia

100
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,280
and encyclopedia is a summary of what's

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,260
already been published Wikipedia is not

102
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,410
an anarchy it's not an experiment

103
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,670
there's actually a quality control

104
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,500
process in Wikipedia yes it's true that

105
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,630
anyone can go to Wikipedia click the

106
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,250
edit button at the top of every page and

107
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,680
then edit whatever content that they

108
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,420
want in the article that's true after

109
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,150
someone edits though there's a system of

110
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,090
bots and human moderation by means of

111
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,860
which people see every edit that's

112
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,780
coming in to Wikipedia the bots suggest

113
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,489
the ones that are more risky put those

114
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,200
in front of human eyes quicker but

115
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,970
people do check Wikipedia and the

116
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,010
standard of quality control on Wikipedia

117
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,230
is that information in Wikipedia should

118
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,390
come from a reliable source that

119
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,500
somebody cites

120
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,540
what's a reliable source well generally

121
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,400
we depend on librarians to define those

122
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,870
we have all kinds of systems in place to

123
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,370
make sure that librarians are helping us

124
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,769
make our policies publications of a fine

125
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,209
organization like the National Academy

126
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:19,750
of Sciences

127
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,700
these apply you can summarize insight

128
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,230
these kind of sources in Wikipedia and

129
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,300
we're happy to be here with experts who

130
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,040
will help us improve the quality of

131
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,170
Wikipedia so supposing you're with an

132
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,430
organization supposing you have

133
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,440
knowledge that you would like to share I

134
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,780
would like to invite anyone in such a

135
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,090
position to edit Wikipedia share your

136
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,100
knowledge and publications in Wikipedia

137
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,990
how can you do that well first you

138
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,250
should think about what kind of content

139
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,480
you have and what is the scope of

140
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,700
Wikipedia do you really have information

141
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,290
to share that's of general interest are

142
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,700
you willing to work in a collaborative

143
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,680
environment knowing that other humans

144
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,850
are going to be commenting on what you

145
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,070
do and can you handle the kind of reach

146
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,630
that wikipedia has are you looking to

147
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,340
reach like a million people because we

148
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,900
compete is not a good fit if you're just

149
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,340
trying to reach people in a certain

150
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,360
neighborhood or people in a small

151
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,240
community if those seem to fit think

152
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,410
about what you're doing in your

153
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,060
organization and how much control you're

154
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,520
willing to yield if you'll only tolerate

155
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,470
publishing and academic journals or

156
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,940
putting it under books and you don't

157
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,070
want any community conversation you're

158
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,870
too close for Wikipedia it's probably

159
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,440
not right for you to put your content up

160
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,930
to public scrutiny however if you could

161
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,250
put it into Wikipedia and you can

162
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,350
tolerate other editors think about what

163
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,960
you're getting from this it's from the

164
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,730
Wikipedia community perspective we don't

165
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,860
want information trapped in libraries

166
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,560
where it's less and less acceptable and

167
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,780
other organizations might not want their

168
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,310
information freely free on the internet

169
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,080
where anyone can say whatever they want

170
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,030
but there's a happy medium wouldn't it

171
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,560
be nice if we could combine the

172
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,360
expertise of the National Academy of

173
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,760
Sciences with the audience reach and the

174
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,800
relevant audience that wikipedia has to

175
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,510
offer we'd really like to see that

176
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,120
happen organizations already invest in

177
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,430
communication in various ways there's a

178
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,780
lot of organizations that hire someone

179
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,550
to post a Facebook or post a Twitter or

180
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,500
post to their own website and they reach

181
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,419
a certain audience I told you that we

182
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:06,340
can PDS traffic metrics are public if

183
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,110
you look at a Wikipedia article say

184
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,570
vaccine hesitancy or climate change or

185
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,160
anything like this you can see how many

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,260
people go to these articles and plan in

187
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,669
advance how many people you would reach

188
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,710
by posting your content there just in

189
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,729
the same way that you make other

190
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,530
communication investments you can have

191
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,510
someone of your staff post a wikipedia

192
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,100
and then measure the number of people

193
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,830
who are reading this kind of con

194
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,780
yet have a coffee with your colleagues

195
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,030
and say how can we share the knowledge

196
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,340
of our organization to reach the

197
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,080
audience that wikipedia has to offer

198
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,540
it's a great conversation to have as I

199
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,920
said I work at the University of

200
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,510
Virginia this is the kind of reports

201
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,970
that someone like me would share last

202
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,500
year at the University of Virginia I ran

203
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,080
13 programs we had 200 people edit

204
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,150
Wikipedia they made accounts they added

205
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,980
two hundred thousand words they added

206
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,910
four hundred and seventy seven

207
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,800
references and the contents been viewed

208
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,840
for four million times that's the kind

209
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,430
of communication impact that somebody

210
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,750
might want with a similar kind of

211
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,370
dashboard or tracking system then

212
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,420
Facebook and Twitter and Wikipedia

213
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,180
offers a similar product if I had more

214
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,680
time I would go through more products I

215
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,690
could do demos of what's popular in

216
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,610
Wikipedia right now I'm keeping this

217
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,470
brief but just to run through and what

218
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,940
I'd be happy to talk with you about

219
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,800
after this or what you could see in my

220
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,300
slides that are posted publicly online

221
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,570
is what we can pedia does so we in the

222
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,700
medicine space we look at epidemics yes

223
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,530
we've seen a few so Ebola was a few

224
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,740
years Zika it had its run and corona

225
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,030
virus is happening right now

226
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,370
so among the people who had it Wikipedia

227
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,650
articles on medicine we look at an alert

228
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,150
system like this and what you could see

229
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,280
this alert system I just took a copy of

230
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,770
this yesterday of the most active

231
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,690
articles in medicine I think like eight

232
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,390
of them are corona virus related people

233
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,550
are editing these so many times so if

234
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,840
you want to know what are the people

235
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,490
behind Wikipedia watching they get

236
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,500
automated alerts like this of where the

237
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,260
activity is and in humans go to those

238
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,940
places and they start moderating the

239
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,710
content in different ways this doesn't

240
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,030
just happen with medicine this happens

241
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,170
with sports or pop culture or

242
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,210
celebrities or politics or anything else

243
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,950
you can imagine but this is part of the

244
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,720
quality control system in Wikipedia that

245
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,760
kind of system is supplemented with

246
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,590
different kinds of automated processes

247
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,850
the first experiment we had an

248
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,100
automation was with copyright detection

249
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,780
this kind of introduced the Wikipedia

250
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,700
community to the idea of working in

251
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,830
parallel with bots and having colleagues

252
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,860
who were robots beyond that there was a

253
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,720
system for detecting bad edits beyond

254
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,940
that we started looking at user accounts

255
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,440
that were engaged in bad behavior

256
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,780
routinely and if you want to talk about

257
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,550
the latest thing talk to this gentleman

258
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,560
over here who's looking for patterns of

259
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,169
misconduct in Wikipedia using artificial

260
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,289
intelligence and another autumn

261
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,659
processes in medicine we especially

262
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,578
adopt these kind of things we have a lot

263
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:40,929
of experience dealing with all kinds of

264
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,509
misinformation in Wikipedia one place

265
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:44,470
that you don't see a lot of

266
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,529
misinformation in is in vaccine

267
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,459
propaganda and the reason for that is

268
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,769
that there's not a lot of business

269
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:52,660
models wary and somebody can make money

270
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,490
by encouraging other people or

271
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,139
discouraging people from taking vaccines

272
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:58,149
where you do see a lot of shenanigans is

273
00:08:58,149 --> 00:08:59,410
what do you know in East cigarettes

274
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,990
there's this billion-dollar

275
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,310
international conglomerate of nicotine

276
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,319
dealers that put all kinds of propaganda

277
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:07,029
on the internet and convince people to

278
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,339
become cigarette activists they go crazy

279
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,440
and Wikipedia but we've kept them under

280
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,940
control for 20 years and we're going to

281
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,199
keep them under control for the

282
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,149
foreseeable future if you'd mess with

283
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:17,709
chiropractic you mess with acupuncture

284
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,600
you mess with alternative medicines or

285
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,490
dietary supplements you're also messing

286
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,829
with somebody's income stream so in all

287
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,389
those kind of things we have people who

288
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:27,040
come to Wikipedia regularly and try to

289
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,750
disrupt things if you want to see how it

290
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,310
goes go to the wikipedia articles for

291
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,690
these things click talk on the top and

292
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,980
see what kind of controversies are going

293
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,170
on we're translating wikipedia content

294
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,459
from English and German and Korean and

295
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:37,690
some of the other dominant languages

296
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,980
into every other language in the world

297
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,810
at the University of Virginia I work

298
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,370
with our School of Medicine and our

299
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,170

300
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,730
translate Wikipedia content in the

301
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,470
languages of India other schools have

302
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,940
other kinds of programs we're trying to

303
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,949
address misinformation in every every

304
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:52,240
country every context in the world

305
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,610
various medical organizations partner

306
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,050
with Wikipedia the most common kind of

307
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,670
partnership is a medical school at a

308
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,620
university some other organizations

309
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,089
which have ongoing partnerships with

310
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:02,470
Wikipedia is copper in the medical

311
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,709

Trust also in the UK they've done

315
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:12,190
different things in Wikipedia and if you

316
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,569
like you can search for weakened PD and

317
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,250
see what their partnerships were we're

318
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,510
trying to manage with citations in

319
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,160
Wikipedia so that the highest quality

320
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,720
sources appear in the most relevant

321
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,339
articles we do this in different ways

322
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:24,100
it's a big data project thanks everyone

323
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,480
for hearing me out and know at the end

324

of the day and I really appreciate your

325
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,029
