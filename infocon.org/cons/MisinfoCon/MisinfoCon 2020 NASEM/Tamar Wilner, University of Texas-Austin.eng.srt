1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,270
great so thanks everyone for being here

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,899
I am going to be talking about a study

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,849
that I did with Avery Holton at the

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,219
University of Utah and I'm at the

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,509
University of Texas and it's about

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,070
breast cancer misinformation on

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,630
Pinterest AHA that works so why were we

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,670
interested in investigating health

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,279
misinformation on Pinterest it's

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,420
something that in 2017 when there was a

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,189
lot of concern bubbling up about

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,289
Facebook and Twitter but there was a

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,630
little bit less about other social media

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,260
sites some news organizations started to

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,200
investigate and BuzzFeed was a notable

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,870
early one not anything scientific but

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,660
they found a lot of false claims such as

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,789
this one and then there was an

19
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:53,100
interesting little ad hoc experiment

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,739
that was done by a professor named mike

21
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,350
caulfield at the university squeezed me

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,699
at Washington State University at

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,670
Vancouver he started out with a blank

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,299
slate on Pinterest and it quickly just

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,920
by saving a a one piece of one

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,540
misleading or seized me to misleading

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,430
pins related to vaccination and autism

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,580
it very quickly filled up into a slew of

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,590
misinformation and conspiracy theories

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,720
so I started thinking with my co-author

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,119
about what how we could do an

32
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,360
examination of misinformation content on

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,880
Pinterest and you might be asking well

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,360
is that interest interest in Pinterest

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,420
justified and I would argue that it is

36
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,829
Pinterest is one of the biggest social

37
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,490
media platforms with 322 million users a

38
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,829
month and health is one of its most

39
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,500
popular topics and Pinterest is also

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,049
overwhelmingly popular with women so the

41
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,990
user base is 70% female which means that

42
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,310
actually 42% of US women are on the site

43
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,350
it also a Pinterest as a platform relies

44
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,719
heavily on visuals which have a unique

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,110
persuasive ability and we decided to

46
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,880
focus on breast cancer because that is

47
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,119
one of the most prevalent cancers among

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,370
women and every woman in the US has a

49
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,989
one in eight chance of developing

50
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,440
breasts can

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,230
sir in her lifetime so what we did was

52
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,220
week hand coded pins or that's basically

53
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,530
what you call a post on Pinterest we

54
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,860
started with a sample of 797 and we

55
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,140
classified pins according to first of

56
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,350
all whether they made a claim about what

57
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,650
users could do to prevent or treat

58
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,200
breast cancer and then if they did not

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,940
we did not study them further but if

60
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,140
they did make such a claim

61
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,360
we analyzed whether there was

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,720
misinformation present by comparing the

63
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,190
claims against those of several

64
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,600
reputable organizations we coded for the

65
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,940
presence of conspiracy theories and the

66
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,400
type of website that the pain linked to

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,590
and we also took notes on the

68
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,480
misinformation presented which allowed

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,520
us to create a typology that you'll see

70
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,140
in a little bit of types of

71
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,270
misinformation as well as topics of

72
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,480
misinformation so what we found was that

73
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,470
22% of the initial batch of 797 pins

74
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,440
made a claim about what users could do

75
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,860
to prevent or treat breast cancer so

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,120
those were the ones that we analyzed

77
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,790
further and just over half of them 51

78
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,180
percent contained misinformation so

79
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,380
breaking down what does that look like

80
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,930
what is the misinformation all about we

81
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,140
broke it down and we found that 40% were

82
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,300
about foods that supposedly prevent

83
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,620
treat or cause cancer another 20% of

84
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,900
misinformation pins were about vitamins

85
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,989
minerals herbs and supplements another

86
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,480
10% we're about supposed environmental

87
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,390
causes most notably most overwhelmingly

88
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,390
about antiperspirant and then there were

89
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,060
all sorts of other in the other category

90
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,790
we have the stages of breast cancer

91
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,150
symptoms surgery hormone treatments the

92
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,610
role of faith in treatment breast

93
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,190
self-exams benign lumps research

94
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,350
organizations and other alternative

95
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,630
medicines besides the foods and the

96
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,459
medicine the supplements that we already

97
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,190
talked about so just to see a little

98
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,930
example of what some of these pins look

99
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,690
like looking at the food claims which as

100
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,550
I mentioned we're 40% of the MS

101
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,099
information a lot of them were mild and

102
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:32,039
nonspecific even among the

103
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,069
misinformation so things like

104
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,180
Mediterranean diet for breast cancer

105
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,120
foods to eat and foods to avoid to fight

106
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,659
breast cancer others went further

107
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:45,180
proposing that 10 certain foods prevent

108
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,970
breast cancer completely or posing cream

109
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,430
of cauliflower soup as the breast cancer

110
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,270
Conqueror so there was a real variety in

111
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,210
the types that we saw some pins actually

112
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,069
advocated for the use of turmeric which

113
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:00,360
interestingly I heard some people

114
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,449
mentioning at lunchtime turmeric is a

115
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:04,680
substance that the breast cancer

116
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,680
foundation Susan G Komen sounds a

117
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,599
warning about saying it should be used

118
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,250
cautiously by people with breast cancer

119
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,300
until more about its effects are known

120
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,879
so the second most popular popular topic

121
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,990
that we saw was supplements vitamins

122
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,509
minerals and herbs and again there was a

123
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,009
lot of variety that you see here

124
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,860
sometimes it was really posing a

125
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,690
particular substance as like an add-on

126
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,139
for a healthy lifestyle saying this tree

127
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,870
bark can help heal digestive issues and

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,479
may even fight breast cancer but

129
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,340
sometimes they really went further in

130
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,020
terms of proposing these substances as

131
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,029
substitutes for more evidence-based

132
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,210
treatments so what we have here is an

133
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,810
example that that really is problematic

134
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,789
on a whole other level what it pictures

135
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,550
is colloidal silver which the Memorial

136
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,889
sloan-kettering Cancer Center says

137
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,069
cannot cure cancer not only that but

138
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,020
long-term use of silver can cause

139
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,940
seizures and kidney damage so it's a

140
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,750
dangerous thing to be promoting besides

141
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,819
analyzing the topics of misinformation

142
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,860
we also talked about misinformation

143
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,060
types so we analyzed these and divided

144
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,190
them into these six types we classified

145
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,500
55% of the pins as exaggerated and that

146
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,330
means that the pin draws a conclusion

147
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,400
that cannot be logically drawn even

148
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,060
though it is based on a kernel of

149
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,009
verifiable information we classed

150
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,900
another 19%

151
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,790
has no evidence which means that

152
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,220
reliable sources documents a lack of

153
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,930
evidence for the claim in the pin and

154
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,210
then another seventeen percent were

155
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,639
inaccurate which means reliable sources

156
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,340
provide information that actually shows

157
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,460
the claim in the pin to be false and

158
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,070
then the others outdated contraindicated

159
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,259
error by omission I'll talk about in a

160
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,240
second but let's just dig into those

161
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,460
bigger categories so here's an example

162
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,280
of an exaggeration saying the humble

163
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,340
vitamin D cannot be ignored when in

164
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,350
reality the findings of vitamin D are

165
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,860
far from conclusive we don't really know

166
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,150
for sure whether it has anti-cancer

167
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,979
properties

168
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,990
there are exaggeration related to all

169
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,310
sorts of foods and supplements

170
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,930
probiotics flaxseed dandelions green tea

171
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,400
also related to the benefits of

172
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,340
thermography and that was exaggerated

173
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,889
when it was compared to the benefits of

174
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,820
mammography an example of no evidence

175
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,240
claim here we have supposedly the best

176
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,220
way to prevent breast cancer is to

177
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,490
detoxify your armpits even though the

178
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,620
National Cancer Institute says that

179
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,599
there's no scientific evidence linking

180
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,470
antiperspirant to breast cancer other no

181
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,539
evidence examples had to do with again

182
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,070
food and supplements those were very

183
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,150
popular just to give you a little little

184
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,630
overview of what were the other kinds of

185
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,300
types of misinformation in our typology

186
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,919
we also had inaccurate that's I'm sorry

187
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,870
we we talked about inaccurate we also we

188
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,000
also had outdated which means the claim

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,060
once was true but is no longer a lot of

190
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,479
those were about the recommended age to

191
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,860
start getting mammograms which was

192
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,270
recently changed

193
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,360
we had contraindicated which means that

194
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,820
reliable sources warn against doing

195
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,770
what's in the pin so the colloidal

196
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,770
silver again would be an example of that

197
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,080
and error by omission meaning that the

198
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,029
pin leaves out information which is

199
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,670
really crucial in that context an

200
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,470
example what that would be a pin that's

201
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,120
all about how to detect breast cancer

202
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,400
and it doesn't actually mention there

203
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,829
may be a lump or a change in the breast

204
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:57,579
so and just a couple other points before

205
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,500
or one other point really before I wrap

206
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,230
up we found that pins were over

207
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,220
overwhelmingly not conspiracy related at

208
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,050
least in this study in in this subset of

209
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,779
pins that we were examining the few to

210
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,370
mention conspiracy theories either

211
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,470
alleged that information on cancer is

212
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,060
being withheld from the public or

213
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,459
implied that research organizations are

214
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:24,519
profiting from cancer but you know you

215
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,259
can see in the PI actually I should have

216
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,149
should have labeled my PI but I believe

217
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,089
it was 95 percent that were not

218
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,029
conspiracy related so what does all this

219
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,910
mean well misinformation on breast

220
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,399
cancer does appear to be pretty abundant

221
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,339
on Pinterest a lot of it may seem

222
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,209
innocuous some of it is really not so we

223
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:48,129
saw the colloidal silver one that's a

224
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,410
dangerous substance that people should

225
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,730
not be trying to medicate themselves

226
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,459
with even the more innocuous seeming

227
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,860
ones like use the Mediterranean diet

228
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,470
well if someone is getting from that the

229
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,769
impression that you know the that the

230
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,529
Mediterranean diet is a proven cure or

231
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,279
proven preventive method and there thank

232
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,550
you

233
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,380
oh and they're doing that instead of

234
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,800
using more scientifically based methods

235
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,630
then that comes to be a problem and you

236
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,870
know pinterest has promised to take down

237
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,250
dangerous health and misinformation and

238
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,810
they have done in a lot of cases but

239
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,550
this does raise the question if they

240
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,050
should be doing more I think it's useful

241
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,649
to have a typology like we outlined

242
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,399
because that gives perhaps a method of

243
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,040
distinguishing maybe maybe it's more

244
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,630
important to focus on those things that

245
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,420
are contraindicated or no evidence as

246
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,639
opposed to the exaggerated claims it's

247
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,259
something to think about

248
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,389
and finally this work illustrates what

249
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:51,160
myths health care workers might want to

250
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,350
think about addressing or what they

251
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,699
might expect to come up when they're

252
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,769
talking with patients so I'll leave it

253
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:57,970
at that and I'm happy to take your

254
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,750
questions

255
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:06,070
[Applause]

256
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:12,369
yes

257
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,320
but nine versus harmful cancer cures

258
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,480
yeah I'm not sure how you would that's

259
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,610
that's an interesting question I'm and I

260
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,649
would be happy to look into that I don't

261
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,170
know how what resources you know if

262
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,170
someone if it has been split up in that

263
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,880
way have you seen it sort of designated

264
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,440
in that way or is it is it just a

265
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,779
completely innocent question yeah yeah I

266
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,570
mean it's like I could imagine it would

267
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,860
be quite difficult to draw the line

268
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,430
because any substance taken to excess

269
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:05,279
could be harmful and so it's it's

270
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,330
difficult to know where you would draw

271
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,149
that but I I'm sure there must be

272
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:11,790
criteria you could draw yeah I would I

273
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,899
don't know I would be interested to find

274
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,690
that as well that's a good question

275
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:21,649
sure yes

276
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:42,460
okay so what we did was we used a

277
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,410
program called parse hub to basically

278
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,130
scrape Pinterest so it was it was acting

279
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,230
as if it was automating the process but

280
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,820
it was basically acting as if I was

281
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,340
going to Pinterest and just typing in

282
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,210
breast cancer or breast plus cancer and

283
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,250
seeing as a search

284
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,870
yeah and seeing what results popped up

285
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,300
yeah it's it's notable that we didn't

286
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,030
actually pin anything to our board and

287
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,980
we weren't seeing what like Auto

288
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,670
populated our board so you know that

289
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,880
might actually turn out to if we did it

290
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,190
that way that might even give more kind

291
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,720
of insidious results because when you

292
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,310
start to select these things and pin

293
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,530
them it recognizes that there's what

294
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:39,640
you're interested yeah yeah

295
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,290
yeah and we didn't and we didn't analyze

296
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,380
it in that way but like a great exam and

297
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,870
it is you know it's one example and it's

298
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,910
anecdotal but if you want to see that

299
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,590
something like that process in action

300
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:04,350
that example I gave of my call field at

301
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,770
University Washington State University

302
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,620
he basically he seeded his account with

303
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,470
a couple of vaccine related posts in it

304
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,700
it auto populated with it just became a

305
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,170
rabbit hole

306
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,450
but yeah it's that that would be an

307
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,120
interesting next step to try and do a

308
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,180
study to look at that that mechanism

309
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,460
alright

310
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,220
can't see the audience okay great thank

311
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,610
you very much

312
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,119
[Applause]
