1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,750
thank you very much I learned more than

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,569
I can offer already sitting through the

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,400
whole morning so I'm the lead physician

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,730
of GSK GSK is one of the largest vaccine

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,519
companies we sell hundreds of million of

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,230
doses and just to give you an impression

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,810
one in four children in the world gets

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,720
one or more of GSK vaccine mostly in the

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,960
developing world but obviously also in

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,760
the u.s. what I want to do in the next

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,880
few minutes talk about some of the

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,640
causes of vaccine hesitancy then what I

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,340
believe is the role of industry and then

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,340
maybe give a first iteration and that is

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,460
also what I want to learn more from you

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,030
guys is how we can all turn form vaccine

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,940
hesitancy into vaccine confidence so

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,579
what is causing vaccine hesitancy maybe

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,770
just briefly the definition it's

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,309
essentially the reluctance or refuser to

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,010
get vaccinated in the presence of

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,170
vaccines so that is very important and

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,330
just to amplify the issue in 2019 WH you

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,360
essentially declared vaccine hesitancy

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,570
as one of the 10 biggest threats for

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,080
global health that was just last year

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,890
obviously defining the vaccine hesitancy

28
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,100
is easier but talking about causes is a

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,250
different matter and to build out what

30
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,880
dr. foo already explained when you look

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,490
at the scale of vaccine hesitancy on the

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,460
left side you have people who want to be

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,549
vaccinated who don't miss a vaccine ever

34
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,649
who vaccinate all their children but

35
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,049
that's a very small group and on the

36
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,869
other side you have the anti-vaxxers who

37
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,960
are very loud who own the internet and

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,119
are much better than the industry or

39
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,520
Public Health Organization as the

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,649
previous speaker already highlighted but

41
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,000
the big middle part people who are

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,740
indifferent who go with the flow who

43
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,780
sometimes take vaccine who sometimes

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,848
forget vaccine even though they have

45
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,008
nothing against vaccination and

46
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,640
obviously in flu

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,520
by the immediate surrounding and by

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,020
social media and the press and maybe to

49
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,590
amplify the impact of of the media just

50
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,050
to use a theoretical example for the

51
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,510
time being just imagine there would be a

52
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,000
corona virus vaccine available in the

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,700
u.s. today I think there would be long

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,250
lines to receive the vaccine and I don't

55
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,820
want to play coronavirus down for the

56
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,090
time being but the risk to catch it at

57
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,489
least today in the u.s. is zero in my

58
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,200
eye so very close to zero

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,660
however thousands of people in the flu

60
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,980
season which is still ongoing half died

61
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,640
this winter in the u.s. just to put

62
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,890
things into perspective another

63
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,620
interesting aspect and again dr. foo

64
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,239
mentioned it with other examples because

65
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,620
vaccinations and vaccines are so

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,430
successful diseases have essentially

67
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,519
disappeared no student in medical school

68
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,480
in the US will ever see hip meningitis

69
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,260
tetanus polio and so are people they

70
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,120
simply have forgotten what these

71
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,130
diseases are all about and essentially

72
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,680
vaccination has been so successful that

73
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,930
real or perceived safety issues are now

74
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,850
much more in the forefront of of public

75
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,930
discussions so then me another thing is

76
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,360
a big difference between medicine and

77
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,540
vaccines is the tolerance for risk for

78
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,100
the right reason and let me go through

79
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,250
the three triangles here the first is

80
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,860
acceptance of adverse reactions so

81
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,040
obviously if you suffer from a severe

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,400
disease and there are medications out

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,989
there which larger side effects you are

84
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,230
much more easy to accept this because of

85
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,839
the underlying disease whereas vaccines

86
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,839
are given to hundreds of millions of

87
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,160
people

88
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,650
young children even infants so the the

89
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,740
tolerance for side effects is obviously

90
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,110
much reward and the middle part the size

91
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,050
of the population entire birth cohorts

92
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,720
of children are vaccinated every year

93
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,210
whereas medicines are used for specific

94
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,900
diseases and specific populations and

95
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,660
then the last thing is the immediate

96
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,880
visibility of the benefits so if you

97
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,130
have a headache and take an ebow profane

98
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,100
or a par set a mode you have an effect

99
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,830
if you have asked mind check an inhaler

100
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,710
you have an immediate effect whereas

101
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,170
last year I go to shingles vaccine I'm

102
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,810
at an increased risk because of my age I

103
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,940
haven't suffered from shingles before I

104
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,030
got a vaccine I'm totally fine I don't

105
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,130
even know whether the vaccine has

106
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,650
prevented my shingles at this moment in

107
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,530
time so in terms of cause and effect

108
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,970
there days there's no visible link

109
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,940
overall so what is the role of the

110
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,730
vaccine industry I think two words are

111
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,830
important access and trust and maybe

112
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,590
talk about access first and the

113
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,300
government also has something to do with

114
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,240
access so making vaccines available make

115
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,400
recommendations making sure that people

116
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
who do not have access to the health

117
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,620
system are not forgotten and get

118
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,900
vaccines but the industry obviously has

119
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,169
to play its role as well and one thing

120
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,990
is to give access to information we sit

121
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,540
on all the information on the risks and

122
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,280
the benefit of vaccines and I have to

123
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,650
make this available but the other thing

124
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,410
is actually giving access to vaccines

125
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,140
and make sure vaccines are always

126
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,260
available which is not always the case

127
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,110
and just a little bit of Education and I

128
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,290
know the slide looks complicated but

129
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,480
essentially two messages vaccines are

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,330
not easy to produce so you have to build

131
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,120
a factory for one vaccine and building a

132
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,370
factory takes usually five years so if

133
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,380
you have a sudden increase in demand

134
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,949
that cannot be delivered over time

135
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:35,710
unlike for medications where this is

136
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,199
much easier but then also the production

137
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,990
of vaccine takes anywhere between six

138
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,379
months for flu vaccine and two years for

139
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,770
the more complicated vaccines before

140
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,900
example use in in the pediatric

141
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,840
population and that means we have to

142
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,810
guesstimate today what is the demand in

143
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,840
in two years from now and most of the

144
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,479
time we get it right however if for

145
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,779
example WH o without any for one and

146
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:08,529
decides that they want to make as one of

147
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:11,770
their new goals eradicate cervical

148
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,379
cancer then they simply no vaccine there

149
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,889
and if if other countries introduce

150
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,349
suddenly recommendations about vaccine

151
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:22,449
and the industry doesn't see it coming

152
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,430
it just takes takes time to adapt so

153
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,629
then the other thing is trust and it's

154
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:33,520
almost an oxymoron when you talk about

155
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,150
the pharmaceutical industry and Trust so

156
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,360
when I left CDC and the German Public

157
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,400
Health Institute 20 years ago people

158
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,729
were saying I'm switching to the dark

159
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,919
side and obviously there is an inherent

160
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,129
bias because the vaccine industry makes

161
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,599
money by producing researching and and

162
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,419
selling vaccines so therefore my current

163
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,460
opinion is that in the discussion on

164
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,990
vaccine hesitancy the industry has to

165
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,279
enable other people who are in the

166
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,879
frontline so health care workers nurses

167
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,740
physicians and pharmacists and give all

168
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
the information we have about the

169
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,080
benefits and the risk is communicated

170
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,810
relentlessly about this to people to

171
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,409
enable the people who are trusted by the

172
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,439
public to true to give this this

173
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,149
information so how can hesitancy

174
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,208
actually be turned in to vaccine

175
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,510
confidence so first of all I think the

176
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,360
term vaccine hesitancy is not ideal

177
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,260
because someone who is hesitant has

178
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,810
questions and concerns and if someone

179
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,880
has questions and concerns these

180
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,800
questions and concerns have to be

181
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,360
addressed so it would be a huge mistake

182
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,720
to lamp the big middle part together

183
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,940
with the anti-vaxxer so stay open and

184
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,459
give or give all the information which

185
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,649
is needed the other thing is obviously

186
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:06,990
that we are living in a hyper-connected

187
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,380
world and there's no shoe no no solution

188
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,510
which streets also there's no campaign

189
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,050
no major idea and and many people have

190
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,600
to to pull together here as other

191
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,250
speakers have mentioned in the morning

192
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,680
my last slides you know be proud to be a

193
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,310
scientist and several people showed

194
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,250
similar slides from from similar events

195
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,970
I think one thing is there is actually a

196
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,339
piece of good news we want to convince

197
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,589
people on the value of vaccine and the

198
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:46,399
vast majority of people are not against

199
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,959
vaccinations so you want to convince

200
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
people to join the majority which is

201
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,660
still a big big thing but it's much

202
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,860
easier than being in the minority but

203
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,649
I'm here to learn I know the industry

204
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,250
has to do even more to be absolutely

205
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,620
transparent on the risk and benefits of

206
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,899
the vaccine governments have to play

207
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,880
their part journalists have to pay their

208
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,449
part

209
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,839
social media has to play their part in

210
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,980
making sure that fake knows is somehow

211
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,810
highlighted as some speakers mentioned

212
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,029
in the morning but also to make sure

213
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,600
that advertising money is not flowing to

214
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,610
people who actually are out there for

215
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,920
misinformation so that's all I wanted to

216
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,829
say I know we are all hopelessly late

217
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,410
and maybe we can join our live Q&A

218
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,920
session thank you

219
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,260
[Applause]
