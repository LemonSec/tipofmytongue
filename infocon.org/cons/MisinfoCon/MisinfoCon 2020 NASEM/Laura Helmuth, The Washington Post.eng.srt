1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,589
everybody thanks for coming thanks for

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:03,540
organizing this great conference the

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,859
talks have been fantastic I've learned

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,359
so much I've got a bunch of story ideas

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,570
too for follow up so I'm here to talk

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,990
about the whole problem of fake news and

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,849
fake accusations that the real news is

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,010
fake news and how journalists are trying

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,369
to deal with that and respond to it it

10
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,140
increased trust to increase the spread

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,789
of real information and do whatever we

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,180
can to compete against misinformation to

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,650
improve the signal-to-noise ratio like

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,640
all of us are here to try to do better

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,410
it's hard to remember but the term fake

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,570
news is fairly recent it isn't something

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,510
people used to say there was an analysis

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,090
by the Committee to Protect Journalists

19
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,219
recently looking at Trump's tweets they

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,020
there are a lot of charts there's so

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,460
much data to work with when you look at

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,129
his tweets and with this this is a

23
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,949
color-coded analysis of what sorts of

24
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:58,500
insults he has against the press and so

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,270
they used to be you know rich and varied

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,469
and about all kinds of things usually

27
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,059
about specific reporters who would

28
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,979
insult and then right up to the election

29
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,920
the red bars are the term fake news and

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,260
so he started saying this more often and

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,030
now you know most days he tweets about

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,920
how were the enemy of the people which

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,869
that's in yellow and then a more recent

34
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,850
talking point is calling the press the

35
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,380
opposition party and that's why I going

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,450
to increase as the as the election gets

37
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,400
closer so that's just the background

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,240
that's what people are hearing and so

39
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,009
what do we do about that how do we fight

40
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,590
that and so what journalists across the

41
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,630
board are trying to do more of is is

42
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,140
show our work so how we know we know why

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,520
are we telling you this where did we get

44
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,070
the information and the one of the

45
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,540
workshops this afternoon is on the

46
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,640
transparency project at science news and

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,990
they're doing a really good job of this

48
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,299
for adults and for for younger readers

49
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,299
and then you know there's been so much

50
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,840
science on misinformation research you

51
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,000
know academic research all the sorts of

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,320
studies we've been hearing about today

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,930
so we've report on that as a subject of

54
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,630
of stories of journalism to kind of help

55
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,189
people understand where's the

56
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,570
misinformation coming from why are they

57
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,429
seeing so much of it and then we use

58
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,489
that research to inform our own

59
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,710
presentation of facts

60
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,160
and how we do our headlines especially

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,480
is something that we really think about

62
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,800
how can we use the principles of

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,120
misinformation research to make sure

64
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,950
we're doing it right and not wrong and

65
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,050
then how do these our principles apply

66
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,670
to coronavirus because we've been you

67
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,090
know scrambling to do that right and to

68
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,350
do all these things as we cover

69
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,740
coronavirus so to show how we do our

70
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,960
work we simply and one of the things

71
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,540
Trump keeps saying is that the news just

72
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,490
makes up sources makes up stories

73
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,680
there's no anonymous sources so we

74
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,720
basically just explained how autonomous

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,490
sources are why why do they need to stay

76
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,870
anonymous what's the relationship like

77
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,280
how do we know they're real

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,900
we don't just take their word for what

79
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,790
they're saying and then we also well one

80
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,620
of the ways that we try to fight

81
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,110
misinformation is there's so much bad

82
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,960
health and misinformation and so we run

83
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,810
a lot of stories trying to expose

84
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,040
especially things that harm people like

85
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,570
stem-cell clinics and in this story we

86
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,280
this is another sort of showing our work

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,810
we have what we call like a did it

88
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,640
section as and this is how we did it

89
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,340
where we say you know we had telephone

90
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,590
scripts internal memos emails we talked

91
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,150
to doctors nurses patient coordinators

92
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,640
this is why this is who spoke on the

93
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,080
record this is who didn't this is why

94
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,240
and then we looked at documents we went

95
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,830
back to the company so basically just

96
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,990
saying again and again we really know

97
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,600
this and it's partly to gain people's

98
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,430
trust so they know they can believe

99
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,470
what's in the article and then it's also

100
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,740
so don't get sued because people like to

101
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,590
see us now that Jeff Bezos owns us and

102
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,270
then another thing we're trying to do is

103
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,430
distinguish between news and opinion and

104
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,540
just label and this is across journalism

105
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,250
you'll see a lot of publications now

106
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,160
sticking the word opinion or the

107
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,970
analysis or a first-person or

108
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,250
perspective at the beginning of a title

109
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,480
especially when it's shared on social

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,100
media because it's really hard for

111
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,600
people to know the difference and know

112
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,490
you know that the editorial staff has a

113
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,870
completely different structure from the

114
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,550
news staff and a lot of times they

115
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,720
publish things that I don't think are

116
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,720
true or that literally aren't true but

117
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,279
that they still publish them because

118
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,510
they have a different kind of way of

119
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,190
thinking about how they share

120
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,270
information and then we you know we

121
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,010
cover a lot of the excellent research

122
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,120
that's been done on how

123
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,520
fake news spreads who is spreading it

124
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,290
how quickly it goes to kind of help

125
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,060
readers understand this phenomenon and

126
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,740
then one of the things that's one of the

127
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,479
principles that replicates really well I

128
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,570
think in the in the misinformation

129
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,190
literature is the idea that if you're

130
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,750
going to tell somebody that they're

131
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,370
wrong or that this belief or this idea

132
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,770
is is not true you need to tell them

133
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,199
what is true as you know as quickly as

134
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,630
you can and as closely as you can to

135
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,180
where you debunk the myth and so this

136
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,350
isn't actually my headline it's another

137
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,960
department but this this story did

138
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,060
really well and I think it it set that

139
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,550
up that you know this fat burning heart

140
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,889
zone thing that a lot of people were

141
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,080
buzzing about at the time you've heard

142
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,940
about this it's not true we're going to

143
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,949
tell you what really does work and of

144
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,780
course it's you know pretty simple

145
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,520
there's no secret you have to exercise

146
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,539
and eat less which is too bad and you

147
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,410
know one of the things about the

148
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,720
anti-vaccine movement is it try it as

149
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,370
we've talked about a lot today it tries

150
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,590
to project this idea that it's just a

151
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,870
grassroots movement and all these people

152
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,160
are concerned and shouldn't you be

153
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,570
worried too because all your friends and

154
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,789
neighbors are worried and so there was a

155
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:39,380
nice study showing look tracking

156
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,849
tracking the money following the money

157
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:43,760
and yeah there's just two groups this is

158
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,940
Robert F Kennedy jr. and his group is

159
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,130
one and that's where most of the money

160
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,479
comes from so that's really who's

161
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,240
fueling it and that's partly so so

162
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,400
people understand that it's not it's not

163
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,020
a broadly distributed things still most

164
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,639
people know that vaccines are right

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,620
there's just a few bad actors who are

166
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,210
really trying to stimulate mistrust and

167
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,610
then you know another another thing with

168
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,229
with misinformation is it really helps

169
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:12,139
people know not to trust something if

170
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,840
they can be shown why somebody is lying

171
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,060
to you and so this is a we did a big

172
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,099
story about Joseph Mercola and he's

173
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:20,750
lying to you because he could make a ton

174
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,280
of money making people think that if

175
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,770
they buy his vitamin C supplements that

176
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,510
they can protect themselves from measles

177
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,889
and it's much you know much better than

178
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,289
getting a vaccine so I'm showing that

179
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,599
motivation kind of helps people question

180
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:33,620
what they're hearing from the anti-tax

181
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,409
movement and so this brings us to

182
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,780
coronavirus this is just a screenshot of

183
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,590
the

184
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,270
the homepage of the Washington Post and

185
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,390
for the past several weeks we've had it

186
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,330
what's called a live blog and that's the

187
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,710
thing up in the corner this live updates

188
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:57,170
and we this so we keep constantly

189
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,610
updating this with you know as news

190
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,020
comes in from around the world is a

191
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,690
timezone shift where the you know what's

192
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,330
happening in the research where the new

193
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,950
case counts what are the you know new

194
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,020
recommendations and it's been sort of

195
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,330
top of people's minds and we're finding

196
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,680
people are really really interested

197
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,540
that's people are just constantly paying

198
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,190
attention to this and it's a little bit

199
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,530
of a feedback loop because you know if

200
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,360
we put it above the you know digital

201
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,160
fold it's right there in people's faces

202
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,320
if they come to the homepage and the

203
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
constant updating makes it get more

204
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,710
attention from Google because news is

205
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,510
breaking and so then people pay more

206
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,620
attention to it so it gets more traffic

207
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,990
and so that that gets more Google

208
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,700
searches to your so it's been this this

209
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,220
constant loop it's legitimately a huge

210
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,280
news story but we have to kind of think

211
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,740
about you know at what when should we

212
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,020
say this is this parts really alarming

213
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,820
this part is just a you know kind of

214
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,080
boring update and you know when there's

215
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,250
something happening that everybody's

216
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,440
paying attention to and there's a lot of

217
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,090
confusion about that's just a perfect

218
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,820
situation for misinformation and so one

219
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,290
of the ways to sort of disarm the disarm

220
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,240
misinformation and help people kind of

221
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,790
cope with the lack of information is to

222
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,040
say what we do and don't know and that's

223
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,070
often really a very effective method

224
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,780
when you're communicating about science

225
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,880
you know people have a lot of questions

226
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,190
it's just super disarming to say well

227
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,780
this is something scientists don't know

228
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,610
yet this is something they want to know

229
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,440
here's a couple ideas but they're not

230
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,400
sure what the answer is they'll figure

231
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,470
it out or if they're hoping to figure it

232
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,240
out and then then you can kind of focus

233
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,400
on what is known and people are a little

234
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,320
less kind of spun up about the the

235
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,059
questions they have like telling people

236
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,230
that there isn't an answer to a question

237
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,179
is the answer to the question in some

238
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,490
situations and so we've done about three

239
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,710
three articles like this and we're doing

240
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,900
them pretty much every week on just

241
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,490
updating what's what's the latest and

242
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,560
the science is moving incredibly fast so

243
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,450
Reuters the other day did a

244
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,340
really nice graphic presentation of just

245
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,860
the scientific literature on coronavirus

246
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,540
and you can see the the kovat 19 you can

247
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,830
see this is just the number of papers

248
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,270
published so it's happening really fast

249
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,800
everybody's trying to get their data out

250
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,080
there sequencing it they're testing drug

251
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,970
candidates they're you know

252
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,770
characterizing it talking about case

253
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,950
studies or clusters and what's nice is

254
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,270
that a lot of the journals have dropped

255
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,270
their paywalls for these it's very it's

256
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,310
it's just everybody's really really

257
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,110
working hard and working fast and trying

258
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,310
to share information and being very

259
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,070
generous with their information but what

260
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,050
that means is there's a lot of stuff

261
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,490
that gets out that turns out to not be

262
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,420
true in this this rush to share and so

263
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,310
this in this graphic the yellow pages

264
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,440
are the papers that aren't peer reviewed

265
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,930
the white ones are and then some of the

266
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,360
black marked through ones or papers have

267
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,330
been withdrawn so there's just it's it's

268
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,980
it's hard to sort out what's real and

269
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,200
what's not legitimately without any bad

270
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,290
actors and this is another chart from

271
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,590
that same analysis looking at the let's

272
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,360
see the the x-axis is the number of

273
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,600
tweets the y-axis is news article links

274
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,040
so you know I like to think the news

275
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,420
article links are more legit in the

276
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,700
tweets who knows and the one outlier is

277
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,680
a paper suggesting that the virus was

278
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,620
related to HIV which it wasn't I think

279
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,210
as far as I could tell it was a legit

280
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,850
just error but that that kind of you

281
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,430
know surprising news spreads really fast

282
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,200
on social media even though it's been

283
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,280
retracted and so we you know as part of

284
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,410
our coverage we've published I imagine

285
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,450
at least a thousand articles by now if

286
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,380
you include that blog post we tried to a

287
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,660
lot of a lot of publications are trying

288
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,080
to equip people to recognize what the

289
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,000
misinformation is and how it's spreading

290
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,870
and why so we cover that and BuzzFeed

291
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,870
News had a really really nice list they

292
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,920
did it they did a great job there were

293
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,710
some of the first to jump on the list of

294
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,870
the disinformation and where did it come

295
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,460
from and how do we know it's false and

296
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,410
just made it really simple for people to

297
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,120
see you know if this is coming around in

298
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,400
your Facebook feed this is what this is

299
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,260
why we know it's not true and it's not

300
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,590
true and here's here's why so this is

301
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,190
this kind of it

302
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,730
equipped readers to quickly tamp down

303
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,750
you know there are social media

304
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,790
connections and share real information

305
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,210
which I love the the study earlier today

306
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,900
showing that that can be really

307
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,430
effective not just for the person who

308
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,720
shared it and maybe not for the person

309
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,220
who shared it originally but for

310
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,080
everybody who's watching the correction

311
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,660
of their acquaintances and they do so in

312
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,070
one of them we've talked about before

313
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,510
the you know there's all these miracle

314
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,550
cure Kaede claims a lot of it from the

315
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,890
anti-vaccine movement there never was a

316
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,900
situation so bad that somebody from the

317
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,220
anti-vaccine movement couldn't show up

318
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,520
and make it a lot worse so this is this

319
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,330
is from BuzzFeed's

320
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,880
list and they they put a red X through

321
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,130
the false things which is just a nice

322
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,890
visual cue of yeah this looks like it's

323
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,940
legitimate it looks like there's

324
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,830
evidence but it's completely wrong the

325
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,560
problem is like reality is really just

326
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,300
as bizarre as the stuff that's made up

327
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,420
so this is true the South Korea spike

328
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,980
like more than two-thirds and I think

329
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,510
now it's like three-quarters of the

330
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,670
cases in South Korea are linked to a

331
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,900
really just sect which is a newspaper

332
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,250
way of saying cult the heads the the

333
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,290
leader decodes the Bible to find

334
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,510
messages of an impending apocalypse

335
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,880
which is so cinematic but it's it's also

336
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,040
true so it's hard for readers to know

337
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,140
what what's legit and what's not so we

338
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,090
try to you know when when there is

339
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,620
something like this it's just so bizarre

340
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,690
but also true then we certainly

341
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,650
certainly cover it and then I mentioned

342
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,920
headlines you know it took journalists a

343
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,930
while to realize that you have to debunk

344
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,450
the myth in the headline you can't just

345
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,300
say you know politician X said Y Z you

346
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,760
have to say politician X falsely claimed

347
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,300
why is he otherwise you're just passing

348
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,160
along this thing that was said it's true

349
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,540
it was said it's just a thing that's not

350
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,180
true so we're trying constantly to say

351
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,220
debunk fringe conspiracy theory doesn't

352
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,560
always work

353
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,080
senator US Senator Tom cotton repeated

354
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,710
the the myth it was in the last slide

355
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,150
that the corona virus was part of a

356
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,220
biosecurity lab and was a weapon that

357
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,899
was released so he

358
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,699
he did that and so instead of just

359
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:24,589
saying Tom cotton says that the

360
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:26,240
coronavirus was made in a secret lab in

361
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,300
China we say you know he's repeating it

362
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,680
it's a conspiracy theory it's already

363
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,220
debunked

364
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,160
- just like tamp it down immediately so

365
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,629
that's what we are doing but you know I

366
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:37,220
think as everybody is said here it's

367
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,129
it's really the platform's you know the

368
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:41,779
the more they can do the better because

369
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,759
that's that's where it's spreading the

370
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,379
mainstream media for the most part aside

371
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:46,939
from the you know the like some of the

372
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:50,929
main coverage of the the anti-vaccine

373
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:52,519
bills like sometimes you get clusters of

374
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,990
bad luck or reporting but for the most

375
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,519
part where it's really going bananas is

376
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,709
on the platform so if we can all all

377
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,269
find better ways to do what we can as

378
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,220
individuals to to fight misinformation

379
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,720
but you know it's it's really going to

380
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,230
be algorithm solutions for a lot of this

381
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,040
thank you

382
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,799
