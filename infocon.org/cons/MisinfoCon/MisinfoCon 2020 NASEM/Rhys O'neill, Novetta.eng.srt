1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
all right I will be short and sweet I

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,419
know we're getting a little tight on

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,870
time now so my name is Rhys O'Neill I am

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,120
a senior open source analyst for a

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,969
company called at no betta we are based

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,700
in the McLean area here in Virginia

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,100
I support the National Institutes of

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,000
Health

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,630
and their Ebola studies that we started

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,750
in Liberia and are now in the Democratic

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,820
Republic of Congo my company is

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,990
primarily DoD facing and I had the

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,610
really fortunate opportunity to use some

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,559
of these really high-powered well-funded

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,460
tools in a humanitarian sense and we've

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,050
really made a lot of significant

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,040
progress in doing so so just before I

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,620
get into kind of how we do it we first

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,660
started at the tail end of the bull

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,510
outbreak in Liberia where the NIH wanted

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,480
to do Ebola studies there a series of

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,440
studies that went on for about three

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,690
years but they were concerned about the

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,750
public sentiment around Ebola in general

25
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,730
kind of would people even show up for

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,260
these studies are they going to put a

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,549
lot of resources and money into a

28
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:06,840
program that won't have any

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,860
participation and therefore a study

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,710
that's not successful so we did ground

31
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,150
assessment we use a field team and off

32
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,860
we'll also look into any kind of open

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,590
source data we can get from broadcast

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,890
print media social media all the way

35
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,900
down to local leaflets that we can find

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,950
in communities so we worked there for

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,470
three years by the end of it the kind of

38
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,259
public perception of the prevail Ebola

39
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,720
study program was high enough that we

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,110
transitioned to the DRC as that outbreak

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,460
picked up and I'll get into that in a

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,079
little bit so just to give a kind of

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,740
overview of how we do it in general were

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,490
media analysis but you know that term

45
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,130
media is getting I think a little more

46
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,340
blurry recently especially with a lot of

47
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,680
these new apps popping up but we look

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,280
again print broadcast social media and

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,758
kind of local media we can get our hands

50
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,070
on we process it by putting in our own

51
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,120
meta data so we have a human curation

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,490
that's tied into machine learning that

53
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,610
allows us to really take in a vast

54
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,480
quantity of data and do it rapidly so we

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,480
can assign this you know these little

56
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,510
intricacies to what we pull in and that

57
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,750
looks like you know a certain newspaper

58
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,180
article we'll pull a few quotes all the

59
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,950
quotes from that article we assign

60
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,820
source sentiment location and in topic

61
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,920
so over time we build a pretty

62
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,290
comprehensive database that allows us to

63
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,209
see who's saying what how they're saying

64
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,240
it look at specific groups or citizens

65
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,970
pro this or pro that and it really gives

66
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,780
us good insight into who wins certain

67
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,520
individuals that have a lot of power in

68
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,010
the media speak about a certain subject

69
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,780
how that's going to be disseminated and

70
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,650
then reflected by citizens later on we

71
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,890
provide weekly output reports to the NIH

72
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,140
to kind of help their community

73
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,880
engagement teams on the ground know

74
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,730
what's coming making sure they're not

75
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,260
missing certain pieces of information

76
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,390
and knowing kind of when to stay away

77
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,170
from others so really get around some of

78
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,300
those obstacles and working with

79
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,280
communities in the middle of an Ebola

80
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,570
outbreak so this is kind of our platform

81
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,850
that we're able to visualize all this

82
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,269
data by putting all this together we're

83
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,940
able to see both long term trends which

84
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,880
have become invaluable and kind of rapid

85
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,489
reaction pieces so when damaging

86
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,860
misinformation comes out or in the case

87
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,170
of the DRC quite often security threats

88
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,150
pop up we're able to identify them right

89
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,200
away and let our teams on the ground

90
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,030
know this is what you're facing

91
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,180
you know either evacuate the area or be

92
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,500
prepared to talk about this when you

93
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,370
enter these communities and we had a

94
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,320
really significant win in

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,829
the DRC that really is also was

96
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,880
supported really well by the software

97
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,660
group at Nevada as well I was able to

98
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,780
working with my field team access

99
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,920
whatsapp channels and the significance

100
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,100
of that was there was primarily

101
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,780
misinformation on Facebook when we first

102
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,970
started in the DRC in February of 2019

103
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,590
but a lot of criticism popped up about

104
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,970
that and those community conversations

105
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,350
where people were kind of speaking

106
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,720
freely and talking about Ebola response

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,700
personnel the MSF whu-oh how they wanted

108
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,900
there was a lot of backlash that started

109
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,290
picking up as more attention was paid to

110
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,010
this misinformation on Facebook and

111
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,080
towards a few months later everybody was

112
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,210
really proud of how they had moved away

113
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,470
from the misinformation on Facebook but

114
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,330
we found it actually transferred on to

115
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,040
whatsapp where they were private

116
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,600
channels and no one could really tell

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
them what to do working with our field

118
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,070
team we're able to access these channels

119
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,950
and sit down and you know watch these

120
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,930
conversations happen in local

121
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,780
communities that don't happen in a

122
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
survey they don't happen when you go out

123
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,930
and approach communities and want to

124
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,720
talk about specific subjects so you know

125
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,840
there's posts about everything from the

126
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,210
local soccer team to you know Donald

127
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,550
Trump being the local hero oddly enough

128
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,640
in the DRC and all the way to Ebola

129
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,940
content so we don't just look at Ebola

130
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,400
content in a silo we're seeing what

131
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,630
everyone's talking about the media

132
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,050
across the board and a lot of times we

133
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,210
would see frustrations with the WH o or

134
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,520
MSF as to why people did know

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,500
information or that hasn't gotten out

136
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,880
there when they've been broadcasting on

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,470
the radio and things like that because

138
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,210
people didn't care there were security

139
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,910
issues going on where many people are

140
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,770
dying in their communities from rebel

141
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,510
attacks that Ebola is not really an

142
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,640
issue you know even other healthcare

143
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,890
issues were more important in time so it

144
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,570
really helped us to give it give context

145
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,430
to what we were looking at and what we

146
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,919
need to do approach when you can't keep

147
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,260
jamming these communication efforts in

148
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,870
the community

149
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,340
that don't want to hear about Ebola

150
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,860
anymore so it really helped us kind of

151
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,660
contextualize that as we went forward so

152
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,030
kind of a snapshot of some of the stuff

153
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,630
we do with misinformation we're able to

154
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,330
identify kind of where this stuff comes

155
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,270
from and track it through the different

156
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,960
media sources so we're cross-referencing

157
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,390
radio to whatsapp to Facebook to local

158
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,270
print and a lot of times where people

159
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,790
keep talking about whatsapp or Facebook

160
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,670
being the source of the misinformation

161
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,260
it's not really true in a lot of cases

162
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,490
where a little further away from you

163
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,820
know highly densely populated areas

164
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,890
where radio stations kind of get some

165
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,660
information about what's going on but

166
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,330
not everything so they get on their

167
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,860
broadcast and they fill in those gaps

168
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,040
and it's from those pieces of

169
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,660
information that aren't quite accurate

170
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,890
but they're close to the other

171
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,470
information that we see a lot of this

172
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,830
kind of rumor mill build and that

173
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,410
information is taken on to whatsapp and

174
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:37,930
Facebook and it's spread rapidly and so

175
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,680
because we're doing this

176
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,780
cross-referencing as we've kind of

177
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,850
looked back into some of our historical

178
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,010
data we've identified where these

179
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,260
sources are who are the most prominent

180
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,090
ones starting this misinformation and

181
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,340
how to work backwards and approach those

182
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,190
rumors at its source and move on from

183
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,340
there so I have a few case studies just

184
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,690
to really drive home the point I guess

185
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,040
so in June we came across this story on

186
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,730
whatsapp where you know it really gave a

187
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,620
real-world example as to how damaging

188
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,570
misinformation can be especially in the

189
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,030
frontlines of an epidemic or you know

190
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,220
something as tricky as an Ebola outbreak

191
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,140
in a war-torn area so there wasn't a lot

192
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,250
of trust towards international

193
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,830
responders in the first place but the

194
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,360
information was not getting to local

195
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
communities as fast as it should or a

196
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,710
lot of communities didn't want to hear

197
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,460
it so there was an ongoing rumor that

198
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,370
once someone died of Ebola the response

199
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,469
teams would harvest their organs and

200
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,060
send them back to the United States for

201
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,890
a multitude of reasons came out of that

202
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,750
strange line but it got so intense that

203
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,100
people were rating the morgues to bring

204
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,690
their family members home so they didn't

205
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,620
lose their organs and they could

206
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,360
actually you know pass on to the

207
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,010
afterlife that they felt appropriate

208
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,380
because their body was intact should the

209
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,149
organs be removed that wouldn't happen

210
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,350
so in this specific example a man his

211
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,660
brother died they he and a few friends

212
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,250
went and took the body out of the morgue

213
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,230
they were chased by the police they

214
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,540
discard the body but they'd all come in

215
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,130
contact with it and then they dispersed

216
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,580
in their communities so now Ebola

217
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,089
contact moving into a community this was

218
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,880
right for a really large spike in Ebola

219
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,310
cases in the DRC and this is something

220
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,160
that we pass on to our response team

221
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,390
saying hey this is something you need to

222
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,550
pay attention to first of all we need to

223
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,350
address this information but be ready

224
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,610
for increased cases as well and because

225
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,350
we don't take this information in a silo

226
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,380
we look at every kind of subject that we

227
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,060
can we've stumbled onto a really in

228
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,650
intricate security situation as well I'm

229
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,630
sure a lot of you have heard about the

230
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,750
insecurity in the area but that

231
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,150
long-term trend analysis we were able to

232
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,440
start to identify when messaging became

233
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,330
a little more aggressive in social media

234
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,730
channels or even on the radio

235
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,950
specifically on the radio that it was

236
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,740
more likely for an imminent attack

237
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,620
whether it be negative messaging to

238
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,020
international responders it's probably

239
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,329
gonna be a treatment center you know

240
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:26,160
towards the UN they were going after a

241
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,110
UN facility

242
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,579
even though was not always direct

243
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,890
messaging that came out of that and we

244
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,529
started to see that these spikes came

245
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:36,959
before an attack and then after an

246
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,029
attack they quickly dropped the final

247
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,360
one is one of these events the

248
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,600
misinformation about a multitude of

249
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,890
things that the international

250
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,980
respondents were doing was pretty

251
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,500
strong but the as they moved into

252
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,630
different communities the the messaging

253
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,910
didn't really change whatever they were

254
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,980
saying in Benning City as they moved

255
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,340
into a smaller region and set up another

256
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,830
treatment center they didn't really

257
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,040
adapt to the local narrative to address

258
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,340
kind of local beliefs as much and quite

259
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,550
often we saw issues like this where they

260
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,650
knew communities get all the negativity

261
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,010
from you know operating facilities in

262
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,940
different regions that have kind of a

263
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,790
wider following or are pushing content

264
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,460
in whatsapp or Facebook and so they're

265
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,600
getting a lot of this misinformation

266
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,820
with no real verification and then a

267
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,800
team walking into their community and

268
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,970
setting up a treatment center in the

269
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,550
middle of town led to a lot of

270
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,680
confrontation and this fortunately for

271
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,740
us was quite often shared on whatsapp

272
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,130
there's somewhat of a gentlemen's code

273
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,370
for Congolese two Congolese that they

274
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,710
the rebels will even share or you know

275
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,080
post this flyer saying we're going to be

276
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,900
here in a tomorrow and attack so I don't

277
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,490
really want to injure anybody but we're

278
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,450
definitely going to burn down this

279
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,020
building so please leave and it serves

280
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,270
as a great warning but it gave us a lot

281
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,960
of insight into what resistance in these

282
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,090
communities can lead to and more

283
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,700
importantly how much misinformation can

284
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,210
impact the work people were doing so the

285
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,910
biggest lessons we learned were

286
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,080
identifying these media narratives early

287
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,900
and being prepared going into these

288
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,480
communities to understand the local

289
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,660
perception was vital in both Liberia and

290
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,840
the DRC more specifically the DRC and in

291
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,180
the feedback loop of when community

292
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,130
engagement happens so doing an initial

293
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,930
assessment knowing that these issues are

294
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,410
going to be confrontational and on the

295
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,880
back end after the communion gateman

296
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,160
happens reassessing and saying hey this

297
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,910
was positive this worked here use these

298
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,380
pieces here and it's going to be

299
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,790
different somewhere else but at least we

300
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,170
know how to be successful in one

301
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,150
location

302
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,220
and then understanding the changes over

303
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,050
time like I said we're really useful in

304
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,210
kind of finding out where we needed to

305
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,800
start paying attention and more

306
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,560
importantly for a lot of these NGOs or

307
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,050
groups working in our outbreak response

308
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,420
is knowing where to allocate resources

309
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,280
there's not a ton of money right off the

310
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,020
bat it's got to get really bad to get

311
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,050
the money in there so knowing when to

312
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,090
approach knowing who's important enough

313
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,660
to approach keeping that you know as a

314
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,070
standard really helps people put

315
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,020
resources in the right way and not spend

316
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,470
money in a way that is going to slow

317
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,770
down response mechanisms as it continues

318
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,750
on and I think I went over time and I

319
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,580
apologize so that's all thank you

320
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,159
[Applause]
