1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,319
well it's great to be here with you all

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,130
today I am a recovering academic not

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,910
current academic my PhD and masters are

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,550
both in public health but I'm the CEO of

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,880
a public health nonprofit we have an

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,310
office here in DC New York Atlanta and

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,330
San Diego or about 40 people half of

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,100
them are public health practitioners and

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,060
then the remaining staff are media and

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,480
marketing people and what we do every

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,079
day is large-scale behavior change

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,059
programs for public health we only work

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,640
on public health programs and then we do

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,550
public health program programs campaigns

15
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,730
and we do a lot of media monitoring we

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,329
were founded in 2013 and we basically

17
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,550
anything under the umbrella of health

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,000
communication were involved in so we

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,649
have people here from the NIH we were

20
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,539
the organization that told the NHS story

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,640
about building 10 on the Discovery

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,039
Channel and then we also do these these

23
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,799
larger sort of big data programs around

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,470
misinformation which is why I'm here

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,040
today

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,750
it's really nice to be here in a room

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,430
full of people who study misinformation

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,080
and work in this space that's not often

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,270
the case for me normally I'm presenting

30
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,950
to your more classic public health

31
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,960
audience and so there's a lot of

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,820
catch-up that the audience has to do to

33
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,799
understand what I'm saying so I'm going

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,009
to skip all that catch up today we work

35
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,170
on basically a huge portfolio of public

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,560
health programs it's sort of the gamut

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,820
as many things as a Health Department

38
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
does we're involved in and I'm gonna

39
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,570
jump right to a program that we run

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,570
called project vector project vector at

41
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,810
the moment PGP public good projects is

42
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,579
the only organization the United States

43
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,100
that monitors continuously 24 hours a

44
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,290
day seven days a week every day that

45
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,070
year vaccine misinformation so there are

46
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,990
a lot of organizations that do this we

47
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,780
provide it in real time to health

48
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,810
organizations across the country and our

49
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,540
pilot program was established in the

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,030
state of New York so we monitor all data

51
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,970
from publicly available media sources so

52
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,500
any social media data we can get our

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:13,800
whole

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,040
our hands-on but also television like

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,800
broadcast news print so newspapers and

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,130
magazines pretty much every website just

57
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,990
anything we can purchase and analyze

58
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,320
using big data techniques which I won't

59
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,850
go into during this talk about which I

60
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,960
will happily talk about my 3:30 workshop

61
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,130
so project vector was set up

62
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,280
specifically for vaccine misinformation

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,390
and I'm going to show you how it works

64
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,590
this is a real-time technology

65
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,330
demonstration so we'll see if it

66
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:06,440
actually functions okay

67
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,760
this is something that public you also

68
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,230
see how many tabs I have open at any

69
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,160
given moment it's it's just like my

70
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,170
apartment I know where everything is but

71
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,850
if you move it a little bit than I've

72
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,290
lost it so this is an example of what we

73
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,710
pull weekly so so how this works is we

74
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,220
have big data mechanisms behind the

75
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,480
scenes here and this is a public website

76
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,370
that requires a password to access to

77
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,320
get a password we have to know who you

78
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,800
are and vet you and that is because

79
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,070
anti-vaxxers are not nice people so I

80
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,460
get the previous panel empathy is where

81
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,410
we need to start but if you've been on

82
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,110
the front lines of this it's not a

83
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,330
friendly debate so it's very different

84
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,040
than being in a one-on-one interaction

85
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,500
in a doctor's office if you're if you're

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,060
doing this on a larger scale like a

87
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,280
population scale they find where you

88
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,920
live they find your friends and family

89
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,310
and they attack you so we have to do

90
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,230
precautions on any data sharing that we

91
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,959
do because we always assume an

92
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,370
unfriendly audience is going to get hold

93
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,230
of the data but we do our best to

94
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,190
mitigate that as much as we can we

95
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,950
filter this data according to national

96
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,530
level and then upstate New York and the

97
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,840
rest of New York is there anyone here

98
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,810
from New York City okay few of you so

99
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,530
upstate New York is not New York anymore

100
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,860
and so we like I said every week we we

101
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,330
update this and what we're doing is

102
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,050
we're not focusing on pro-vaccine

103
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,190
information or neutral information

104
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,530
related to vaccines we're interested

105
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,480
specifically in anti vaccination

106
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,970
information and we found some

107
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,470
interesting things through the through

108
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,620
this process one it shifts as the news

109
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,620
cycle shifts so right now anti-vaxxers

110
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,530
are really interested in coronavirus and

111
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,870
then if you zoom in to specific hotspots

112
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,460
in the United States their interest

113
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,200
changes depending upon a particular bill

114
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,770
so everything about the anti vaccination

115
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,419
argument becomes about what's happening

116
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,550
in a particular moment in time as a

117
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,620
public health person I can say this is

118
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,249
one of the things public health is

119
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:22,189
horrible add is adapting quickly I would

120
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,769
also like to point out that what has

121
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:29,029
changed over the last 15 years if you

122
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,149
think about it have vaccines gotten less

123
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:36,409
safe or less effective no the only thing

124
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,969
that's changed and the reason there is a

125
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:41,179
manufactured debate about vaccines is

126
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:43,519
because of the proliferation and the

127
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,129
ease of misinformation so I think it's

128
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,599
important if you're on the public health

129
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:49,819
side of this thing to remember that the

130
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:52,489
facts haven't changed and this all

131
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,249
happened under our watch so all of the

132
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:57,559
techniques that we were using 20 years

133
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:00,139
ago saying that we're gonna double down

134
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,689
and just do those techniques more often

135
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,549
it's probably not gonna be the right

136
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:07,009
answer because this all happened while

137
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,419
we were doing all of those techniques

138
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,009
and while we're continuing to do them

139
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,179
from 20 years ago

140
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:13,249
I think we need a really really dramatic

141
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,519
change in our tactics and when I talk to

142
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,709
people who follow this thing closely or

143
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:20,929
we go to City Council meetings and have

144
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:22,459
a bunch of people in red shirts show up

145
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:24,579
and scream at them they agree with me

146
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:26,929
and I think if you talk to people like

147
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,789
that are on the vaccine expert advisory

148
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,069
panel for CDC they are saying very dire

149
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:33,199
things things on the scale of a climate

150
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,909
scientists we're behind the eight ball

151
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:37,069
we don't know what we're doing we need

152
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,749
help we need dramatic changes and

153
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:42,589
strategies and tactics so we often see

154
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:44,989
this conflict is this friction between

155
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,449
the measured Public Health approach that

156
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,899
we're trained in school to project and

157
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:54,009
then the reality of a growing

158
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,909
anti-vaccination movement it is not

159
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,499
plateaued and things are getting worse

160
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,479
and I don't think we can solve this

161
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:00,709
problem without acknowledging that

162
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,209
things are getting worse every day not

163
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,349
they're not getting better

164
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:05,029
all of the techniques that we just heard

165
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:07,429
about and the last panel may or may not

166
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,199
be effective but they're not being

167
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,599
scaled if we found effective solutions

168
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,849
they are not occurring at all on a

169
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:16,339
national level or even a local level and

170
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:18,229
that's that's really really clear in the

171
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:23,360
data here there are a few recurring

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,299
themes over and over and over again and

173
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,249
there are a few recurring people over

174
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,569
and over and over again that are

175
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,819
responsible for the overwhelming

176
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,440
majority of

177
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,260
misinformation that people succumb to

178
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,560
and then become anti-vaccination they're

179
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,860
very identifiable they're very loud and

180
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,920
they don't want to be hidden it's what

181
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,600
do we do with them once we find them

182
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,160
that's the real question though that

183
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,340
we're faced with so you feel free if

184
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,140
you're in the audience to sign up for a

185
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,780
project vector right now this is

186
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,920
information that's happening right now

187
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,810
in this week there's a lot of conspiracy

188
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,640
theories about coronavirus as was

189
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,240
mentioned there the thing in Maine right

190
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,080
now is skewing everything so and news

191
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,940
organizations aren't helping

192
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,170
I think news organizations are actually

193
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,060
working really well most the time on the

194
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,730
side of science but in Maine for some

195
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,170
reason probably because it's Maine and

196
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,220
Maine's weird they all the local news

197
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,560
organizations are saying big pharma is

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,540
pushing an agenda and it should just get

199
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,960
vaccinated so that's a weird it's it's

200
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,310
kind of hard to predict state-by-state

201
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,260
how this thing goes but I want to show

202
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,659
you some of the things that we learned

203
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,020
doing this project

204
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,790
here are the top authors on Twitter that

205
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,980
create over 60% of all misinformation

206
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,940
about vaccines so it's really easy in

207
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,800
public health to feel like the I can't

208
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,030
figure out what's going on here it feels

209
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,080
like every single day there's new

210
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,220
information I don't know what to do I

211
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,870
don't know how to look to look at them

212
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,970
if they're real easy they want you to

213
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,460
know who they are the question is what

214
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,130
do you do like I said we need effective

215
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,710
techniques and it's not cutting the head

216
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,150
it might be cutting the head off the

217
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,420
snake

218
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,630
off of this Hydra but social media

219
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,240
companies don't want to do that for

220
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,570
probably really good reasons but so what

221
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,400
what techniques do we use as a public

222
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,230
health community and how do we do a lot

223
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,110
better job of getting the public the

224
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,760
silent majority the middle of the

225
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,620
american public middle of that belt that

226
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,640
bell curve activated most people are in

227
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,490
favor of vaccines but they're not doing

228
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,170
anything there is sitting on the

229
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,430
sidelines we haven't given them

230
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,110
something to do and in public health

231
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,700
forums we still talk about it like it's

232
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,820
our job it isn't our job our job is just

233
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,350
if you're a public health organization

234
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,240
or institution your job is to stick to

235
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,820
your facts and probably we're like that

236
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,090
cool Navy looking suit and stand and

237
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,370
read your PowerPoint there's a thing

238
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,900
that the public needs to be given to do

239
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,250
it needs to be activated and if you

240
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,870
think of other movements marriage

241
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,460
equality sexual harassment racism all of

242
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,130
these societal movements all have an

243
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,350
identifiable theme and identifiable

244
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,300
identity and people can join it and feel

245
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,830
like they have equity in it but right

246
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,180
now we're not giving the public any

247
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,040
equity in the vaccine debate if you look

248
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,560
at themes used by the top authors the

249
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,200
top anti-vaxxers on twitter here's what

250
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,560
they talk about and when you can dig

251
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,180
further and further into this like I

252
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,770
said it kind of fluctuates week by week

253
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,400
month by month but this is this tends to

254
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,460
be where they were they land on so a lot

255
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,220
of policy discussions so again this kind

256
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,960
of flies in the face a lot of what you

257
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,000
hear from public health people who don't

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,800
track this every day they're actually

259
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,090
like the the individual incessant

260
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,040
attention to every ingredient in a

261
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,170
vaccine is not the largest thing

262
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,930
anti-vaxxers used to argue with you it

263
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,399
might be in a doctor's office but it's

264
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,860
not on the population scale so potential

265
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,500
messaging strategies let's take one

266
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,380
thing I also never hear is us learning

267
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,839
from other movements so the people

268
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,540
Public Health again like where I love us

269
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,000
but we're really siloed we silo

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,829
ourselves when is the last time an

271
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,209
epidemiologist talked to a health

272
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:39,800
communications person in the same office

273
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,930
where they speak different languages and

274
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,649
they don't know how to talk to each

275
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:44,810
other so now take that on a much larger

276
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,050
scale the vaccine people never talk to

277
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,310
the tobacco control people and the

278
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,930
tobacco control people never talk to the

279
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,339
people who work on sexual and

280
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,800
reproductive health totally different

281
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,910
conferences so now it's even harder to

282
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,980
look outside of this and look at other

283
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,320
movements but here's an example from

284
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,269
counterterrorism the State Department

285
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:08,200
right here in DC attempted to counter

286
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,060
terrorist propaganda across social media

287
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,040
a few years ago this is relatively

288
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,050
recent and they started with a group

289
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,860
called the Center for Strategic

290
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,470
counterterrorism communications it was a

291
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,430
horrible dismal disaster well documented

292
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,100
by good investigative journalism and the

293
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,980
reason it was a horrible failure was the

294
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,110
State Department used its own accounts

295
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,390
to start arguing with terrorists online

296
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,769
let that sink in for a second it was

297
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,779
amazing and the examples are still there

298
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,820
present it would be like someone who's

299
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,040
recruiting for Isis would get a gif of

300
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,100
an American flag and and the State

301
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,110
Department would say you're wrong

302
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,060
America is the best country on Earth or

303
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,860
I have some screen grabs here we would

304
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,339
insult their English proficiency so this

305
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,649
all fell apart and then what they did

306
00:12:57,649 --> 00:12:58,910
was they switched to the global

307
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,959
engagement center which is what's

308
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:01,519
running right now and the global

309
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,779
engagement center has a totally

310
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,750
different tactic interestingly enough it

311
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,640
was co-created by a marketing person

312
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,660
from New York rather than it's like

313
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,329
military people at the State Department

314
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,220
so global engagement center which I

315
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,649
received no money from by the way and

316
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,160
instead said actually probably the

317
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,839
majority of people in the world don't

318
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,000
like terrorists

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,980
so why don't we just give data and

320
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,399
support to the vast majority of people

321
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,620
and organizations in every country who

322
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,930
deplore terrorism and extremism and

323
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,750
since they've been doing that the amount

324
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,529
of terrorists messaging on social media

325
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,470
has gone down dramatically and it's none

326
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,880
of it has the State Department's logo on

327
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,320
it it's because they started treating

328
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,180
people like partners and stakeholders in

329
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,790
their own lives and and got away from

330
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,279
this viewpoint of we control what

331
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,730
happens when when terrorism pops up I

332
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,279
think we should do that for vaccines and

333
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,399
I don't see that happening very often

334
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,420
there's not a lot of health departments

335
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,579
out there who are bringing in all of the

336
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,920
people locally who are pro science who

337
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,630
can be identified as a potential ally

338
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,430
and arming them with information than

339
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:18,709
sending them out do also this is from

340
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:22,370
our data but almost no religions

341
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,350
prohibit vaccines the involvement of the

342
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,720
faith community is almost nil so we need

343
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,010
to do a better job of engaging with the

344
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,380
faith community professional

345
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,529
associations and thought leaders

346
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,820
chiropractors are a huge problem and

347
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,350
nobody's talking about it for some

348
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,390
reason I don't know why maybe it's

349
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,800
because we allow them to wear white lab

350
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,470
coats for some reason and other

351
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,180
countries by the way don't but

352
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,490
chiropractors in a core part of a

353
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,640
chiropractor's training is that your

354
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,170
solutions for your medical problems

355
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,880
shouldn't come from your body not from

356
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,529
the outside so there are two

357
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,149
professional associations that represent

358
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:57,500
chiropractic in the United States and

359
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,540
one of them is openly against vaccines

360
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,329
on its website and we don't do anything

361
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:03,829
about it and we also let those

362
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:05,630
chiropractors walk around in hospitals

363
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,329
giving people medical advice so if you

364
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:10,220
look for people who are doctors online

365
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,829
who are arguing against vaccines they

366
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,779
are often not a medical doctor or a

367
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,579
public health researcher like myself

368
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:21,529
they are a chiropractor then you have

369
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,529
social media influencers we don't use

370
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:29,060
them at all so we try to get we we often

371
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,680
publish our research in peer-reviewed

372
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,170
journals and one of the most common

373
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,199
critiques I get back from editors is it

374
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,910
will be explaining how we mobilized

375
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,610
communities

376
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,500
public health purpose and we use social

377
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,120
media influencers as part of this and

378
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,920
then I'll get I'll get questions back

379
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,350
from a viewer saying explain to me what

380
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,870
social media influencers are and why do

381
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,880
I do those matter I need a lot more

382
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,769
evidence on why you should include this

383
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:53,910
in your paper or why this is a good

384
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,620
methodology what I would like to say

385
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,959
back to them and what I'll say here is

386
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,420
brands in this year in 2020 are expected

387
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,660
to spend 15 billion dollars on

388
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,700
influencer marketing that is the only

389
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,579
citation that I need we have we can

390
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,760
learn a lot from other sectors brands

391
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,620
are not stupid people who work in

392
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,630
marketing are not stupid they're using

393
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,790
their own research to inform their own

394
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,380
decision making and where their dollars

395
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,450
go and they have a lot more dollars and

396
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,220
more resources than public health has so

397
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,600
I think we have things to learn from

398
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,089
other groups we talk about cross sector

399
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:28,410
collaboration a lot in public health

400
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,390
that like I said earlier that tends to

401
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,959
stop it

402
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,769
I talked to an epidemiologist and then

403
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,930
mass appeal that was my earlier point

404
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,060
just make it so that people can get

405
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,720
involved

406
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,329
we have no human rights campaign we have

407
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:46,230
no 350.org we have no one campaign where

408
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,790
where the hell is the campaign that's

409
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,860
pro science it doesn't exist so when

410
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,649
you're thinking about what to do

411
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:57,560
government can do certain things and

412
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,170
then the rest of society can do other

413
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,959
things and I'm going to show you an

414
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,359
example on the next slide I don't I'm

415
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,040
not personally convinced but I would

416
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,660
love to see data and I know people are

417
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,240
gonna study it is it worth the CDC's

418
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,630
time to go refute things at an

419
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,959
individual level I used to work at CDC I

420
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,339
worked in the center for tobacco control

421
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,740
I worked on CDC's one large campaign the

422
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,040
tips and former smokers campaign it is

423
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,130
really hard work and it is thankless

424
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:35,790
work and no one likes you so I often

425
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,520
have that quote that survey reported

426
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,260
back to me that 80% of the American

427
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,320
public believe you know trust the CDC

428
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,090
I'm really dubious about that to be

429
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,760
totally honest it's it's often trust in

430
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,059
comparison to other federal agencies

431
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:52,980
great I don't know if that's a

432
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,700
Inchon that I would want its versus USDA

433
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,610
and CDC I guess I have a vague

434
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,290
understanding of what USDA does so it's

435
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,559
easy because they're in movies and

436
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,470
they're in their cool suits it's it's a

437
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,390
really tough one and and what we see in

438
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,040
the data every day is that there's a lot

439
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,600
of erosion of public trust in

440
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,980
institutions and this is not new

441
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,929
information there's a reason the

442
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,130
administration looks the way that it

443
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,630
does there's a reason the world looks

444
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,880
the way that it looks right now so

445
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,440
relying too much on if you put a

446
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,940
government logo on it people are going

447
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,500
to trust it I think would be a huge

448
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,660
mistake because again that's what we

449
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,460
have been doing for 20 years and this

450
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,850
happened while we were doing that so

451
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,490
look at this this is from today this is

452
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,250
on the CDC's account talking about the

453
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,820
flu vaccine all of the comments are

454
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,250
negative all of the comments are

455
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,590
anti-vaxxers except for maybe one like

456
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,030
one innocent person that just goes to

457
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,580
doses and then everybody else this thing

458
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,169
you're lying you're taking money from

459
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:54,600
pharma it's just it's this constant

460
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,760
stream of vitriol directed toward the

461
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,450
CDC and I know that the reason I

462
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,070
understand all the biases here but my

463
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,169
point is if you are a member of the

464
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,630
public and and our our response to the

465
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,690
vaccine debate is defer to the CDC then

466
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,790
what someone gets when they go there is

467
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,840
a thread of the CDC is wrong that's a

468
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,520
really really big problem so it can feel

469
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,650
like this right now if you're in the

470
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,030
middle of this whole thing and there's a

471
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,830
in our in our in our own work it feels

472
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,010
like this a lot but I think to go back

473
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,540
to my point I wanted to show you share

474
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,790
you one example from from our work and

475
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,260
then I'll stop this is a flu promotion

476
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,110
campaign funded by Kaiser Permanente so

477
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,640
it's across eight states in the District

478
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,010
of Columbia and it's focused on vacci

479
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,450
traditionally vaccine hesitant

480
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,000
communities communities that are vaccine

481
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,250
hesitant for really damn good reasons

482
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,590
Latin X and african-american communities

483
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,809
so it's not focused on Santa Monica or

484
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,200
Portland so and that's probably why we

485
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,159
were successful what we got here was if

486
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,480
you if you just mobile we had 120 people

487
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,460
who accounted as influential in their

488
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,470
cities that they lived in and so we

489
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,049
selected a social-media influencer based

490
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,000
upon the zip code that they lived in and

491
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,250
who their followers were I have no

492
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,929
concern with who this person is as an

493
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:20,520
individual I'm concerned about who they

494
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,470
reach and what we found were every

495
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,880
single time one of these people said

496
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,070
here is why I'm personally getting a flu

497
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,220
the flu vaccine this year they had an

498
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,520
average of 500 comments on every single

499
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,190
post that they made and 93% of those

500
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,410
comments were positive so if you

501
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,360
juxtapose that with what the with the

502
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,080
CDC's there is something to learn from

503
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,750
that there we also evaluated this sort

504
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,750
of a case control and we had

505
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,679
statistically significant shifts and

506
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,030
knowledge and attitudes and behaviors

507
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,470
related to vaccination in these

508
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,750
communities as opposed to communities

509
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,750
that didn't receive the intervention so

510
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,950
this again though it's not large enough

511
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,110
scaled it's across eight states but we

512
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,929
need to get it much bigger and I would

513
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:09,120
love to stop being questioned about the

514
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,940
use of an engaging real human beings and

515
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,320
the work of Public Health so that's it I

516
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,570
think I'm thinking about time thank you

517
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,840
very much
