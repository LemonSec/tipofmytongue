1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
I want to ask anybody here who's had a

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,840
problem with the health bill

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,799
- raise your hand okay this one's for

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,830
you

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,250
[Music]

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,560
still kicking

7
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:07,409
next one thank you so much okay so not

8
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,630
long ago members of my family had four

9
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,909
bits of minor surgery about a half hour

10
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,520
each nothing really serious the

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,860
anesthesia bills alone for the first one

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,950
were two thousand the second one two

13
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,369
thousand the third one six thousand

14
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,909
dollars so I'm a journalist I'm like

15
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,470
what's up with that

16
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,340
anyway I did some research and I figured

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,590
out that for the expensive one I was

18
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,390
being charged one thousand four hundred

19
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,509
and nineteen dollars for a generic

20
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,899
anti-nausea medication that I could buy

21
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:47,070
online for $2.49 I had a long and

22
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,720
complicated conversation with the

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,820
insurance company the hospital my

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,789
employer at the time like is this really

25
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,770
what it's supposed to be like and they

26
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,820
all said absolutely totally standard no

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,750
difference from any other procedure so I

28
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,369
started thinking about this a little bit

29
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:07,259
later when I had volunteered for a

30
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,600
buyout from the New York Times and I was

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,540
looking for my next act it turned out

32
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,549
that next act was to found a start-up

33
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:17,610
building it a company telling people

34
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,010
what stuff costs in health care I want a

35
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,380
shark tank type pitch contest to do just

36
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,670
that so health costs ate up 18% of our

37
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,709
nation's gross domestic product last

38
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,350
year but nobody has any idea what stuff

39
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,780
costs this is a huge problem it's

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,590
actually a national emergency 67% of

41
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,870
Americans are either very worried or

42
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,190
somewhat worried about unexpected

43
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,480
medical bills by kaiser study found

44
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,769
another study recently found that of

45
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,220
1,000 patients surveyed 64 percent they

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,680
declared delayed or neglected seeking

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,200
medical care in the previous year

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,730
because of concerns about high medical

49
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,820
bills I can give you names and details

50
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,550
of people who are not going to the

51
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,519
doctor for simple things a mammogram a

52
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,580
blood test

53
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,080
because they think they can't afford it

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,950
mothers who want to care for their

55
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,150
children and can't pay sons caring for

56
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,130
their mothers who can't afford the

57
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:28,090
medication so because of the secrecy and

58
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,620
billing and the finagling of money

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,570
behind the scenes these price variations

60
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,210
are huge the charge for one simple MRI

61
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,950
could be three hundred dollars in one

62
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,760
place or six thousand in the same city a

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,440
common blood test nineteen dollars or

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,680
five hundred twenty two in the same area

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,210
so if someone gets the five hundred

66
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,130
dollar bill and they decide that they

67
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,690
won't go to the doctor the next time

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,770
doctor's order something and people

69
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,280
don't do it the problem gets worse

70
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,950
requiring even more money imagine if you

71
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,260
could afford the diagnosis but not the

72
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,640
cure people died you don't have to look

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,140
too hard these days to find stories

74
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,880
about people who are dying because they

75
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,280
can't afford insulin a medication

76
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,130
invented in 1923 by a man who refused

77
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,540
the patent because he felt it was

78
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,510
unethical is now enriching big pharma

79
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,510
and killing people

80
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,370
patients are angry and afraid doctors

81
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,730
are angry and afraid a huge amount of

82
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,380
human potential is wasted on this

83
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,860
problem we have a giant slow rolling

84
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,840
public health crisis caused by the money

85
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,600
the relationships between patients and

86
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,690
doctors are being shredded by this in

87
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,360
the richest nation on earth we can't get

88
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,540
this right there's a ton of

89
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,050
misinformation disinformation deceit and

90
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,040
secrecy about this topic we can tell you

91
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,990
four examples about scores of people

92
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,660
who've asked her pricing in events had a

93
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,520
procedure and then got a bill that was

94
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,880
double the size people who get

95
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,830
pre-approval for a surgery have the

96
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,020
surgery come out and find out that the

97
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,630
approval has been withdrawn and they're

98
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,700
considered necessary to pay

99
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,290
prescriptions many people are surprised

100
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,850
to find out that if they put away their

101
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,540
insurance card and pay

102
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,070
they're paying less than they would as

103
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,210
an insured person for decades now

104
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,500
presidents have staked their

105
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,960
presidencies on fixing this problem and

106
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,370
still there's a ton of regulation but it

107
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,930
seems largely and effective on

108
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,430
controlling prices either at the

109
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,180
national or the state level that law

110
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,010
that seeks to outlaw surprise and

111
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,380
emergency billing that's stalled in

112
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,050
Congress going nowhere because the

113
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,460
people who are making money off of it

114
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,500
are lobbying against it so what's the

115
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,280
solution

116
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,240
well yes it's journalism so here's what

117
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,160
we're doing to solve the problem we're

118
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,200
building a community created guide to

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,570
health costs and doing journalism that

120
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,450
helps people navigate you can think of

121
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,639
it as something like a mash-up of kayak

122
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,460
and the ways traffic app with great

123
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,030
journalism built in so we built an

124
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,190
interactive app that is powered by

125
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,400
reported data and crowd-sourced data it

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,520
helps you navigate and we do this on our

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,530
home site and in partnership with other

128
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,690
news organizations so how did we do it

129
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,240
we started out really small we started

130
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,360
calling doctors hospitals labs and

131
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,940
clinics asking them for their cash

132
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,810
prices for common procedures some people

133
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,150
were helpful a lot of people hung up on

134
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,210
us many people were just plain rude they

135
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,460
said we don't know or we can't tell you

136
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,979
our lawyers won't let us

137
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,479
but despite the stone Wohlers we got a

138
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,810
lot of really great information in New

139
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,599
York a simple echocardiogram could be

140
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,400
200 dollars in Brooklyn or 2,000 $150 a

141
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,780
few miles away in Manhattan the same

142
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,099
simple blood test in New Orleans

143
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,180
nineteen dollars one place 522 a few

144
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,530
blocks away the San Francisco area the

145
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,229
same MRI $475

146
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:26,030
or six thousand two hundred twenty one

147
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,429
dollars twenty five miles away

148
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,980
these pricing disparities persisted over

149
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,400
all the procedures and all the cities

150
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,810
then we started asking people to share

151
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,140
their price information in New York and

152
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,850
partnership with public radio station

153
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,860
WNYC we asked women to tell us the

154
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,510
prices of their mammograms

155
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,840
so people laughed at us they said women

156
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,160
are not going to want to come on the air

157
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,200
and talk about their breasts this is a

158
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,380
non-starter in the space of three weeks

159
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,350
we had 400 women come and tell us about

160
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,370
their pricing information so gradually

161
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,200
we made it easier for people to share

162
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,260
their cost data online we make the

163
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,930
information public in a thing that looks

164
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,730
kind of like this interactive software

165
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,300
that we place on our partners websites

166
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,070
I'm going to try to do a live demo here

167
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,720
as we all know that technology doesn't

168
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:28,990
always cooperate so as you this is on

171
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,380

172
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,440

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,139

for an ultrasound again you get that

202
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:03,759
autocomplete pull down menu in this case

203
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,679
I'm gonna do this in New Orleans where

204
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,480
we had one of our partnerships and when

205
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,790
you search you get results that look

206
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,119
something like this the prices that we

207
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:18,100
collected are in orange

208
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,259
it says price check journalist up at the

209
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:21,910
top there's this little flag so you know

210
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,050
the provenance of the data that's a cash

211
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,499
price in green we have providers coming

212
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:30,879
to us and saying we want to put our

213
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,029
prices in your database so we give them

214
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,470
a spreadsheet that they fill out that

215
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,790
comports with our data structure

216
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,679
obviously they want to compete on price

217
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,990
right under 25 150 and here's a

218
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,490
community member who paid a hundred

219
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,220
fifty she says I've had my ultrasounds

220
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,019
done at EJ for over twenty three years

221
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,639
my insurance changed I now have a three

222
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,949
thousand dollar out-of-pocket so I paid

223
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:58,240
cash to have this done at each a hundred

224
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,689
sixty six two hundred do I hear two

225
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:09,100
hundred eighty three six hundred forty

226
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,999
nine that's a community member right cuz

227
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,819
it's blue eight hundred sixty five

228
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:18,129
dollars and thirty one cents she had to

229
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:20,470
pay the whole thing and she explains to

230
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,749
us that she had a initial bill of seven

231
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,300
hundred seventy eight dollars and they

232
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,279
she got another bill for eighty seven

233
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,829
she called to complain but they sent her

234
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:33,249
bill to collections so I paid it what

235
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:36,579
can you do but don't stop there there's

236
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,199
a two thousand nine hundred twenty six

237
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:43,269
dollar ultrasound so what we learned

238
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,769
from this is that people actually are

239
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,240
really interested in telling their

240
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,970
stories then we went on to use the data

241
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,369
to make these journalism stories about

242
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:53,379
how to navigate how to understand the

243
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,870
system the woman in the upper left-hand

244
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,629
corner went to the doctor with a source

245
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:01,339
she came out with a diagnosis of frozen

246
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,309
shoulder and a bill for $160 which

247
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:06,949
seemed fair I mean Steve but fair they

248
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:08,389
followed it up with a bill for one

249
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:09,800
thousand four hundred thirty four

250
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,040
dollars and one cent for the facility

251
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,869
fee because the clinic that she went to

252
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,699
as part of the Tulane University Medical

253
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,549
Center Empire now she didn't know this

254
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:21,980
but she wound up with this facility if

255
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,589
I'm seeing nods right this facility fee

256
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:26,899
bill so we wrote a story about it

257
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:28,730
facility fees 101 where does this thing

258
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,829
come from do you have to pay it what if

259
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,449
your insurance company won't pay it how

260
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:34,459
can you avoid it and you ask questions

261
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:36,199
on the front end so you don't get one of

262
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:41,689
these the woman in the bottom right she

263
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:43,869
actually has a hereditary condition that

264
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:46,069
probably affects her now certainly will

265
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,939
affect her later

266
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:48,529
her doctor said we should have a

267
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:52,610
baseline MRI so she scheduled two days

268
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,739
before they called her Tulane University

269
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:57,019
Medical Center and said how you gonna

270
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,209
pay for this thing and she said well how

271
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,860
much is it gonna cost they said how are

272
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,299
you gonna pay and she said I heard you

273
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:04,759
say that how much is it gonna cost and

274
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,709
they said what's your deductible and she

275
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,660
said well $5,000 but what difference

276
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,740
does that make the price is the price

277
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,110
right they said we'll call your

278
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,579
insurance company we'll get back to you

279
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,459
so they know you know they called her

280
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:22,100
back and said we have really great news

281
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,269
you've spent down part of your

282
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,949
deductible it's only gonna be four

283
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:26,480
thousand five hundred thirty-eight

284
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,949
dollars she said what so she happens to

285
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:32,600
work at the times-picayune which is one

286
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,189
of our partners at the time we got to

287
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,379
watch this happen in real time she came

288
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:38,600
over to our reporter and said is this

289
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,089
what these things cost and he said well

290
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:42,589
look in the database and see if you can

291
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,290
find it she came back and said I must be

292
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,660
doing something wrong I found it for six

293
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,360
hundred seventy two dollars and 86 cents

294
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,999
and he said I'm not sure you're doing

295
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,499
anything wrong she was like what do I do

296
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,269
so he said check your work act like a

297
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,419
reporter talk to your doctor and she had

298
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:02,419
it for the lower price and wrote us a

299
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:03,769
note we couldn't write about her because

300
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:05,360
she's one of us but she wrote us a note

301
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,769
explaining that she'd gone from pure

302
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:08,029
terror that she wouldn't be able to have

303
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:09,290
the test cuz she knew she wasn't gonna

304
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,460
get it

305
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,400
to having the knowledge that she gained

306
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,690
from this so our work

307
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,260
sorry our work has led to partnerships

308
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,080
with news organizations in New York New

309
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,970
Orleans Philadelphia San Francisco Los

310
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,640
Angeles Miami and elsewhere we found

311
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,350
that thousands of people want to tell us

312
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,840
this information they think of us as

313
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,090
their gladiators that we're out there

314
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,890
fighting for them in a way that nobody

315
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,370
else is fighting for them information is

316
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,200
power if you give people an idea what

317
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,030
stuff cost they'll do it they can make

318
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,740
the best decisions for themselves and

319
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,030
their loved ones so why does journalism

320
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,240
work here well there is this narrative

321
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,370
that journalism is dead right fake news

322
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,100
blah de blah blah but the truth is that

323
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,770
in this situation the existing

324
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,570
structures can't do anything to address

325
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,870
the problem there's legislators aren't

326
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,940
gonna get to do anything because they

327
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,480
are bound by campaign finance regulators

328
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,760
seem to be ineffective there's a ton of

329
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,740
regulation but it's ineffective unhealth

330
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,740
pricing doctors and hospitals reluctant

331
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,420
to give up revenue insurance companies

332
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,360
the same we're journalists we don't have

333
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,400
to get laws passed we can just go out

334
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,400
there and tell people stuff that's what

335
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,290
journalism is about finding stuff out

336
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,620
and telling people about it now I want

337
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,270
to be really clear price transparency

338
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,770
isn't gonna solve every problem in

339
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,320
health care there will still be

340
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,990
expensive treatments over diagnosis

341
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,330
there still be a ton of fraud obviously

342
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,940
and not everything is shoppable I mean

343
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,380
not everybody wants the cheapest

344
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,770
appendectomy or the cheapest cancer care

345
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,120
but with these facts are really digging

346
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,250
into something that we can actually make

347
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,850
a solution in addition we also started a

348
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,760
conversation involving doctors hospitals

349
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,460
yes but also their patients or as we

350
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,570
like to call them people in addition to

351
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,280
making lives better individually we've

352
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,760
changed policy in New Orleans the State

353
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,260
Insurance Commissioner came on the air

354
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,180
with us to say that he'd had a consumer

355
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,250
protection law waiting in the

356
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,080
legislature for 10 years he said I've

357
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,190
given up on it it's new

358
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,860
gonna pass those legislators will never

359
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,569
go against Blue Cross Blue Shield of

360
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,699
Louisiana and Our Lady of the lake

361
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:31,730
Hospital we launched and nine weeks

362
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,100
later the bill passed by the convincing

363
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,680
margin of 100 to 1 in New York we did a

364
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,959
story about a guy who had he went to the

365
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,420
emergency room the doctors told him that

366
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,370
he if he didn't have surgery on his back

367
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,889
he risk paralysis so he went ahead with

368
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,959
the surgery I mean he chose surgery over

369
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,990
paralysis he got approval he thought but

370
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,670
they came back to him after the fact and

371
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,009
denied it six hundred seventy thousand

372
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,279
dollars worth of bills on him by the

373
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,050
time we talked to him he still owed this

374
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,669
amount of money 220k

375
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:10,130
taken 49 K from his IRA two hours later

376
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,189
the governor's on the phone saying by

377
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:15,319
the way I think I can fix his bill and

378
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,609
you know it seems like the New York

379
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,439
State surprise and emergency billing law

380
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,609
isn't quite working the way it's

381
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,789
supposed to so we have some regulatory

382
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:24,980
changes that were going to inject to

383
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,130
protect consumers so a journalism not

384
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,929
only fixes bills that also changes

385
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,150
policy I can tell you dozens of stories

386
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,500
like this when we tell these stories

387
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,750
like this legislators and regulators

388
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,559
listen so finally what can we say about

389
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,419
this in the context of this discussion

390
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:50,000
about fake news failed journalism and

391
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,460
all that we're saying not so fast we're

392
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,620
building trust in media changing lives

393
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,190
changing policy yes changing the world

394
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,210
who else can do this groundbreaking

395
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,409
worth nobody it's us we do say we're the

396
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,010
happiest people in journalism these days

397
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,120

402
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,140
started asking the right questions now

403
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,679
to save two hundreds already one of the

404
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,649

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,960
slide on this but I did a TED talk on

408
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,269
about this topic that's now closing in

409

on two million views they put it on

410
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:48,760
YouTube and everybody told me don't look

411
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,990
at the YouTube comments they are

412
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,840
universally positive and this is a huge

413
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,260
