1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,680
it's been a wonderful morning I've

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,270
learned so much I love coming to these

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,720
things so hopefully I can add to the

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,780
conversation so I'm it asked me to talk

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,500
specifically about my research in

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,880
vaccine hesitancy or what we call

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,010
vaccine confidence so actually it was

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,240
interesting when I was talking to him

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,279
you know this it's sort of a

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,099
pervasiveness in terms of lack of

11
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,830
vaccine confidence and so even though we

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,170
still vaccinate I felt like I just want

13
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,270
to go over the facts a little bit first

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,690
so three of the things that we hear a

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,079
lot about people being concerned parents

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,340
been concerned about vaccinating their

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,500
children is that they'd like to fight

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,989
infections the natural way they're

19
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,129
worried about the side-effects of

20
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,110
vaccines and then they worry about

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,570
overwhelming the immune system when I

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,160
was preparing these slides I had these

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,870
up here and some of the research shows

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,680
that if you state the miss information

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,199
even if you're saying it to dispute it

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,940
sometimes I get stuck in people's mind

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,880
so I put some nice slides or nice images

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,640
below of the March for science it's a

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,420
sort of counteract the negative in

30
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,020
misinformation that's there so vaccines

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,530
obviously work max mass vaccination is

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,360
one of the most successful public health

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,430
interventions that we have ever had

34
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,130
since public sanitation as you can see

35
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,770
we don't see polio we don't see smallpox

36
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,560
and diphtheria in this country and it's

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
estimated that there have been 322

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,950
million cases of vaccine preventable

39
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,820
diseases that have been prevented from

40
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,250
1994 through 2013 alone and that's

41
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,799
translates into 732 thousand deaths

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,110
prevented as well so I am old enough

43
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,180
that in my practice I have seen

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,360
meningococcemia which is the child's

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,759
foot over there it's a terrible disease

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,429
I have known people who have had polio

47
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,030
although I have not seen any diagnosed

48
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,260
any cases myself

49
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,970
really when we talk about the natural

50
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,060
way this is what nature looks like and

51
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,590
so obviously we don't want to go back to

52
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,790
the natural way in terms of side effects

53
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,659
you know the incidence of side effects

54
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,170
is real but it's also very small the

55
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,090
risk of severe allergic reaction to any

56
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,209
vaccine is one in a million cases and

57
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,209
then nobody talks about we should do

58
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,090
away with tylenol but the cases of

59
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,849
severe reaction to tylenol are 50,000

60
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:47,340
per 1 million and this is a artists

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,859
depiction of what 50,000 people look

62
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:56,010
like the last thing is that the concern

63
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,870
that vaccines will overwhelm the immune

64
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,510
system if that were the case then those

65
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,250
who got more vaccines should actually be

66
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,200
sicker than those who did not right so a

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,590
very simple study somebody who went in

68
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,629
glands went back and looked at kids who

69
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,099
were 2 to 3 years old who had a hospital

70
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,650
or ER admission and compared those to

71
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,760
those who did not

72
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,639
and if vaccines actually weaken the

73
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,129
immune system those who are hospitalized

74
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,840
for non vaccine preventable infections

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
should actually have had more antigen

76
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,510
exposure more vaccines prior to that and

77
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,989
of course that was not the case so it

78
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:38,519
doesn't affect the immune system's

79
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,160
ability to fight infection and we know

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,970
that right our body is constantly being

81
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,799
confronted with different antigens just

82
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,690
a dog licking your baby's face probably

83
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,810
exposes that baby to more antigens than

84
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,790
any single immune any single vaccine so

85
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,769
there is no controversy but obviously

86
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,329
there's a lot of noise as we heard from

87
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:04,970
laticious presentation and why is that

88
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,129
only 2% of kitten der gardeners have

89
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:10,169
vaccine exceptions so those are the true

90
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,959
vaccine refuse errs they represent a

91
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,159
small proportion of the people who

92
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:19,289
actually delay or refuse some vaccines

93
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:21,870
but they have an outsized voice and

94
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,300
because it is on a continuum there are

95
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,950
people who accept all vaccines on

96
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,940
question of an

97
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,250
questioningly there are those who accept

98
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,260
but have doubts and then there are those

99
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,160
who do refuse some but accept other

100
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,380
vaccines and it's all coming from this

101
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,270
small proportion of the society which is

102
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:48,060
having an outsized voice so in multiple

103
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,190
studies my own and others amongst

104
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,040
diverse racial groups pretty much

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,600
everybody says they trust their

106
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,040
physician for vaccine advice but as we

107
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,750
can kind of see from some of the studies

108
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,790
that we've heard today what people say

109
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,340
and how they actually react are two

110
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,190
different things so reality is much more

111
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,030
complicated we did this study and this

112
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,140
was amongst African American parents and

113
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,370
we asked them who they trusted for

114
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,670
vaccine advice and the brown bars are

115
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,680
just overall who they trusted for a

116
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,430
vaccine advice but what we did was we

117
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,770
showed half of the group when we said oh

118
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,690
do you trust a mother who accepted a

119
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,290
vaccine for her own child or a person

120
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,960
who survived the disease half of the

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,060
group we showed race concordant pictures

122
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,150
so other African American examples and

123
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,220
then the other half of the group we

124
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,200
showed a race discord in example so

125
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,250
Caucasian examples and as you can see

126
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,860
overall what we found was that those who

127
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,830
are shown race concordant examples were

128
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,050
more likely to trust that source of

129
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,360
information those who were shown race

130
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,169
discordant examples and actually those

131
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,090
who are shown race concordant examples

132
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,900
of parents mothers disease survivors and

133
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,580
scientists actually were trusted more

134
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,470
highly than those who are shown race

135
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,660
discordant examples of the pediatrician

136
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,560
so this is social contagion theory and

137
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,169
what I like to call the discoverer

138
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,260
commercial theory which is we treat you

139
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,000
like you treat yourself and in those

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
commercials they have people who look

141
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,780
like themselves and they have this great

142
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,460
conversation and you know you're

143
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,470
trusting them with your money and the

144
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,850
subtle message there is that we're

145
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,780
trusting somebody

146
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,270
as they seem like ourselves and in

147
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,980
another one of our studies we found that

148
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,810
8 and 10 parents say that they trust

149
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,910
friends and family for vaccine advice

150
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,790
and that when they reported that their

151
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,500
friends and family had low low

152
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,760
confidence and had anti HPV vaccine

153
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,880
views the parents themselves were more

154
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,360
likely to refuse HPV vaccine so in

155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,240
addition to accepting the advice of

156
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,470
people who we know people tend to accept

157
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,750
the void vice of people who they just

158
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,130
think are like them even if they don't

159
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,650
know these people and so Kay and did

160
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,660
this interesting study this is based on

161
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,690
cultural cognition theory and he got the

162
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,300
baseline opinions of people about

163
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,990
requiring HPV vaccine for schools and

164
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,010
then created these fake archetypes of

165
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,889
different types of people and sort of

166
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,260
plotted them out ahead of time in terms

167
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,870
of where he thought that these people

168
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,479
would be considered in terms of whether

169
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,940
they were highly hierarchical meaning

170
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,610
thinking that the society has sort of a

171
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,650
ranking for where people stand or

172
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,330
whether they were more egalitarian and

173
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,490
that everybody has sort of equal rights

174
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,770
whether they are more communitarian in

175
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,010
terms of whether you know people should

176
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,900
support each other or work whether they

177
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,240
were more individualistic in terms of

178
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,820
everybody should take care of themselves

179
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,720
and then he presented the participants

180
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,490
with different views pro and con about

181
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,800
or just one view for each person about

182
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,410
supposedly from one of these members in

183
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,580
terms of whether this person supported

184
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,950
mandatory HPV vaccine in schools and

185
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,330
what he found was regardless of where

186
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,700
the participant stood when they started

187
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,429
the experiment they would move more

188
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:46,710
toward the viewpoint of the argument

189
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,630
based on whether they thought this

190
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,550
person shared their same worldview

191
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,620
so people adopt the views of people who

192
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,480
they think are like them and then they

193
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,250
adopt the views of people who they

194
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,210
admire and it can be subtle so not all

195
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,560
anti-vaxxers are like that picture I

196
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,180
showed that was at the California State

197
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,010
Legislature when they had mandatory

198
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,820
vaccines they can be celebrities and in

199
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,740
my surveys and other people's surveys

200
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,630
nobody says that they trust celebrities

201
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,300
for vaccine advice because consciously

202
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,190
obviously we're gonna choose the doctor

203
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,920
rather than the celebrity but it can be

204
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,610
subtle and so you know Jessica Biel and

205
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,180
Katie Couric are good examples of people

206
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,710
who come out and say they're not anti

207
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,360
vaccine Jessica Biel lobbied with Robert

208
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,280
Kennedy jr. against the California

209
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,590
vaccination bill and then she said oh

210
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,450
I'm not anti vaccine

211
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,280
I just want parents to be able to make a

212
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,040
choice well that's facetious we don't

213
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,150
tell parents that they have a choice

214
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,890
whether or not children should be

215
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,650
buckled into safety into car seats and

216
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,410
seat belts you know when there's a

217
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,570
preponderance of evidence for something

218
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,850
you know there's no reason for that

219
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,460
choice and Katie Couric says she

220
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,240
apologized afterwards saying that her

221
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,200
segments that she had in which she had

222
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,810
parents talking about unsubstantiated

223
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,670
claims about terrible things that

224
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,850
happened after the HPV vaccine

225
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,320
encouraged she said well I had you know

226
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,930
a scientist as well but the only people

227
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,060
that she had on stage were the people

228
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,560
who had these dramatic stories and they

229
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,300
had a lot of the airtime and then she

230
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,700
had a few minutes of a physician or a

231
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,470
scientist in the audience sort of giving

232
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,260
the rebuttal and so that color's

233
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,740
people's overall opinions I have about

234
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,830
15 minutes per patient to actually

235
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,750
counsel everything in a well child check

236
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,270
and when people are constantly bombarded

237
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,780
by misinformation or subtle cues there's

238
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,180
very little that can do in the two

239
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,420
minutes of counseling to combat what

240
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,780
comes in society so the last thing or

241
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,230
not the last thing in terms of ways

242
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,030
social norms sort of

243
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,910
affect our views is social control

244
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,360
theory so in addition to adopting the

245
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,650
views of people who that we think are

246
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,910
like us we don't necessarily even the

247
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,210
the people giving the ideas don't even

248
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,130
actually have to talk about vaccines in

249
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,300
order to sort of spread this sort of

250
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,010
this this feeling of anti vaccine and

251
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,380
this I call sort of the goopy

252
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,560
pseudoscience spread anti vaccine

253
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,650
sentiment sometimes is wrapped in this

254
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,170
whole sense of group identity and it's

255
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,750
very aspirational for some people so

256
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,970
studies have shown that vaccine roof

257
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,920
users tend to be white wealthy

258
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,220
college-educated they believe in again

259
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,700
the natural way of doing things they

260
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,070
often are vegan or a vegetarian and

261
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,250
believe in organic gardening and so this

262
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,880
is what

263
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,180
Gweneth Paltrow has tapped into she has

264
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,360
said that her brand is very aspirational

265
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,910
so if you can't afford a $72 Church

266
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,860
scented candle you know there are other

267
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,570
ways that you can feel that you're part

268
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,720
of this group by adopting some of her

269
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,660
other you know ideas about crystal

270
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,660
healing power and again doing things the

271
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,300
natural way this group identity is also

272
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,000
mixed in with this idea of being a

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,330
perfect parent so vaccine refuses also

274
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,790
see themselves as experts in their own

275
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,530
children they may not be a scientist but

276
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,600
they know as much as the pediatrician

277
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,640
about their own children and of course

278
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,070
you do want to give parents voice and

279
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,270
have that agency but vaccine refuse errs

280
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,330
tend to be intensive about mothering do

281
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,970
a lot of attachment parenting where you

282
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,740
know anything that their child needs

283
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,920
they should be responding to so again if

284
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,840
you don't have the time to be going to

285
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,530
all the PTA meetings or you know making

286
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,440
your own baby food for your baby you

287
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,200
feel like you are in charge and can make

288
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,150
this decision about vaccinations for

289
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,620
your own child because you know what's

290
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,930
best for your child and so it's a way

291
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,560
when you

292
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,380
make that choice it's it's feels

293
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,390
affirming to some parents like I've made

294
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,220
this decision for my child I am a good

295
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,230
parent so I'm gonna slide a little bit

296
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,080
away from social norms and talk about

297
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,779
some of the other things that affect

298
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,580
people's choice and it's the power of

299
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,580
the personal anecdote and so you know

300
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,830
these are Washington Redskins

301
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,710
cheerleader and Jenny McCarthy and in

302
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,480
their day jobs right you would never say

303
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,670
I'm gonna trust the cheerleader or the

304
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,310
former playboy model for their advice on

305
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:56,120
vaccines but they're there their stories

306
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,089
are very compelling right and so this

307
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,570
Washington cheerleader she said

308
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,220
after she got the flu vaccine she

309
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,660
started to walk backwards she couldn't

310
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,360
speak for a while and really for five

311
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,850
years after her story came out a lot of

312
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,250
of my parents were concerned about the

313
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,770
flu vaccine and my vaccination rates

314
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,580
went down because of her story Jenny

315
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,860
McCarthy you know she talks about her

316
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,050
son and if you can see that image right

317
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,930
she is associating greenness and being

318
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,690
environmentally conscious and and being

319
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,990
organic with refusal of vaccines and she

320
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,150
has this story about how she protected

321
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,220
her son and that resonates with people a

322
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,380
lot and of course he probably had Lando

323
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,839
cleft nurse syndrome which is associated

324
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,950
with decreased speech fluency around age

325
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:51,230
of two and seizures which her son had so

326
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,860
why does this happen people like to find

327
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,470
patterns in meaningless noise it's a way

328
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,830
that we are able to organize our world

329
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,680
it explains why a 10 year old grilled

330
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,690
cheese sandwich sold for 28 thousand

331
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,970
dollars on eBay because people could see

332
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,410
the Virgin Mary in it it also explains

333
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:17,380
why people believe that side effects or

334
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,850
abortions for instance happen from

335
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,180
vaccines if you give 10 million women

336
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,330
pregnant women any shot you know the

337
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,610
natural spot rate of spontaneous

338
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,180
abortions

339
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,200
mean that over 16,000 of them will have

340
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,390
a spontaneous abortion and of course

341
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,190
it's a very devastating thing for a

342
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,500
woman to experience and people look for

343
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,150
meaning and a lot of people will

344
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,200
associate that if it is coincidence with

345
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,950
a vaccine and then lastly is the issue

346
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,230
of confirmation bias so people tend to

347
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,320
believe things that reinforce their

348
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,920
prior beliefs so for instance nigh hand

349
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,060
did this study where he gave people

350
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,830
facts based on the CDC information and

351
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,630
those people who actually received

352
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,029
corrective advice about the flu vaccine

353
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,029
after receiving it actually were less

354
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,320
likely to accept the vaccine if prior to

355
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,790
receiving the information they were anti

356
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,810
vaccine so I am running out of time I

357
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,810
just wanted to quickly say things that

358
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,839
we can do to ensure vaccine confidence

359
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,430
improve education and science and math I

360
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,920
think we all know that the US has been

361
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,860
stagnant after being very low compared

362
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,740
to other countries in terms of math

363
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,110
education we are below Latvia and

364
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,700
Slovenia in terms of our scores and

365
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,360
that's been that way for several years

366
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,220
the other thing that I recommend is

367
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,630
supporting school immunization

368
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,970
requirements not only does that protect

369
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,170
people who aren't able to get the

370
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:09,500
vaccine as well as as people who haven't

371
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,959
zero converted it reestablishes the norm

372
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,599
if everybody is getting the vaccine then

373
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,410
it's something that we all do as you can

374
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,220
see in this slide the gray states are

375
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,290
the ones that have only medical

376
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,679
exemptions so most of the country allows

377
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,770
different exemptions for vaccines that

378
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:37,440
are not medically indicated okay and

379
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,830
then lastly mobilize the community

380
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,360
know why these are sliding in give voice

381
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,670
to the majority of you remember that

382
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,340
anti-vaxxers are only 2 percent of the

383
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,840
population so do it through love so send

384
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,080
fun cards mom thank you for loving

385
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,550
supporting and vaccinating me do it

386
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,470
through humor too bad there isn't a

387
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,660
vaccine against stupidity and do it

388
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:10,020
through raising your voice this is my

389
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,500
family at the March for science you know

390
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,990
sometimes it's awkward to actually you

391
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,820
know being somebody who actually studies

392
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,500
this it is even awkward for me when I

393
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,930
hear other parents saying anti vaccine

394
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,840
things so do it subtly you know where

395
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,840
the button mind says flu shot check or

396
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,910
wear the t-shirt so I have a t-shirt

397
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,760
that says science not silence but the

398
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,130
main idea here is don't be silent

399
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,280
use your voice subtly or loudly and make

400
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,660
sure that others hear the majority of

401
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,810
you because vaccine saves lives

402
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:49,940
[Applause]
