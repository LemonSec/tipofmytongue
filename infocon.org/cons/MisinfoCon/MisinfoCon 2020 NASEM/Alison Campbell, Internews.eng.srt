1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
hi everyone and thanks so much for

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,990
having me I've loved hearing everybody's

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,359
presentations and I feel that everybody

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,280
has had a little piece of something for

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,290
me either to make me feel good about

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,809
what introduce does or to make me wonder

7
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,089
in question more about what engineers

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,850
does in the misinformation space inter

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,820
news is not a news agency intern use is

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,070
an international nonprofit that works

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,320
through partners in media and tech in

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,279
more than 70 countries worldwide to try

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,710
to ensure safe access to timely reliable

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,110
fact-checked information that can help

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,690
people make informed decisions about

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,219
their lives participate in their

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,489
communities and hold power to account

18
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,200
for the last six or seven years I've

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,360
been in charge of responding and the

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,239
information space to humanitarian crises

21
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,750
including Ebola in West Africa Guinea

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,750
and Liberia the Nepal the Nepal

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,910
earthquake the Mediterranean refugee

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,970
response hurricane Matthew in Haiti and

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,850
then Ebola again in Democratic Republic

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,720
of Congo I'm going to share we are

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,600
preparing right now or doing our best to

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,380
design a response to the corona virus

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,880
I'm not going to speak so specifically

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,650
as to what that might be as to talk a

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,869
little bit about where we come from in

32
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,420
this arc of learning towards designing

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,729
for a situation which bears similarity

34
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,229
to other situations we have dealt with

35
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,420
but comes with a new set of

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,640
complications that's always the fabulous

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,900
thing about these kinds of emergencies

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,020
they're always different so we simply

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,500
put what we know is that in humanitarian

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,590
and public health emergencies

41
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,990
information is that a premium demand is

42
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,890
high in terms of in times of uncertainty

43
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,130
supply may be wiped out in the case of

44
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,439
conflict or natural disaster in the case

45
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,360
of public health emergencies very often

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,580
it's more about the supply of

47
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,849
information being controlled or being of

48
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,470
poor quality or being

49
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,560
carotids by rumor misinformation we love

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,650
facts the overwhelming amount of work

51
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,840
that we do is with local media partners

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,790
in the countries where we work I'm a

53
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,560
journalist by background and so facts

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,050
are fundamentally important

55
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,270
we love the international fact-checking

56
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,460
Network we were so happy to see the

57
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,930
launch of it a couple of weeks ago it's

58
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,630
a perfect point of departure for us so

59
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,920
anything that I'm going to say about

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,410
facts in my presentation is by no means

61
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,660
suggesting that we don't need them but

62
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,270
into news very much picks up where the

63
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,160
fact checkers leave off and if we don't

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,540
have to necessarily do our own

65
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,160
fact-checking that's a wonderful thing

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,170
many of our media partners in countries

67
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,250
where we work have existing

68
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,350
relationships with the fact-checking

69
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,930
their networks for instance in in

70
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,680
Indonesia so this is what we like to

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,940
think this was the way that things

72
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,940
ideally would be big fat facts and small

73
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,209
skinny rumors what it often feels like

74
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,650
when we get to the ground is this the

75
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,060
kind of situation we might we've

76
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,420
basically been discussing all morning

77
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,940
and we generally think that yes I love

78
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,830
it when people take photographs thank

79
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,470
you

80
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,480
what we generally think of as the first

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,760
recourse in this situation is that

82
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,090
that's what we think we should do that's

83
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,800
in fact where we went into the Ebola

84
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,780
crisis in Liberia we went in to do the

85
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,519
typical kind of work that we would do

86
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,060
with journalists in crisis at community

87
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,640
and that is to rally them around put

88
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,500
them together with experts give them

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,440
more facts inform them better on the

90
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,040
matter of science and public health they

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,900
quickly became acquainted of course with

92
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,730
the public health service information

93
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,120
with which Liberia was bombarded I mean

94
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,290
when you say wall-to-wall it was

95
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,640
literally if you've seen photographs at

96
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,920
that time there wasn't a wall space that

97
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,168
did not have a public health message on

98
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,630
it the messages were few and simple wash

99
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,269
your hands don't touch the don't touch

100
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,630
the bodies use the chlorine water that's

101
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,120
provided for you so

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
there was no corner of that country that

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
was untouched by the basic facts of the

104
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,660
health information messages that were

105
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,560
given to people however this is where

106
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,820
the kind of glitch in the machine comes

107
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,419
in some at some point in time it became

108
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,430
clear that there were in Liberia what

109
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,900
people called resistant communities and

110
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,770
for the first time medical

111
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,419
anthropologists were actually called in

112
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,560
to advise w-h-o and others on what this

113
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,590
might be

114
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,419
Engineers experience in crisis after

115
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:16,050
crisis is that this place here my actual

116
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,350
concern the small voice there is where

117
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,280
the trust factor comes in because

118
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,330
regardless of what the facts are and

119
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,820
whether these and whether individuals or

120
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,740
communities have access to have access

121
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,289
to those facts if there isn't somebody

122
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,470
to address the actual concern which may

123
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,660
or may not be related to the medical

124
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,510
facts not paying attention to my actual

125
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,270
concern breeds typically in communities

126
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,550
a lack of trust in those who are trying

127
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,340
to convey the facts and this may be your

128
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,419
local government your national

129
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,690
government or in the situation kind of

130
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,580
situations where we work a big health

131
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,030
agency and this lack of trust in facts I

132
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,229
think as others have pointed out this

133
00:05:58,229 --> 00:05:59,550
morning can be as dangerous as an

134
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,810
absence of facts so what we find in

135
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,120
these kinds of situations when we go in

136
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,990
to give people facts or fact based

137
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,660
primarily fact-based information is that

138
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,030
we those who are looking to counter

139
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,160
misinformation are focusing on what we

140
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,840
know and there's a kind of inbuilt

141
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,760
assumption there that what we know is

142
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,560
what they need to know and that's

143
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,300
usually the point of departure when we

144
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,380
go to do our very well-intentioned work

145
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,300
we in turn use we don't worry too much

146
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,610
about the what is the source approach

147
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,130
it's labor intensive and we have other

148
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,930
labor intensive work and very small

149
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,760
resources so this business of

150
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,220
identifying the source discrediting

151
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,780
it's a little bit of a whack-a-mole as

152
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,670
far as we're concerned in terms of how

153
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,940
we would use our resources it's a

154
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,900
potentially limited use because there

155
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,560
will always be more sources and

156
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,120
controlling the information or

157
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,510
controlling the message tends to smack

158
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,140
of spin and even in countries where

159
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,760
people you know are not very well

160
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,420
educated or even literate they certainly

161
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,360
do have a good sense of who might be

162
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,100
trying to sell them a message and so

163
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,260
that's where we come back down to the

164
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,170
trust business so when we go into

165
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,700
communities and I have to say that there

166
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,880
is an issue of scale here if we're

167
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,250
looking at misinformation at scale in

168
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,100
need of any given country we would be

169
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,140
seeking to work with the media in that

170
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,970
country that would be independent media

171
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,380
local language media large scale ie in

172
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,780
Thailand the Public Broadcasting

173
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,520
Corporation for instance with whom we

174
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,470
have a relationship preferably when

175
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,610
we're talking about public health

176
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,740
emergencies we would look for the most

177
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,140
vulnerable or most affected populations

178
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,320
and go to their local media a community

179
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,720
radio station which which would be a

180
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,800
powerful potential ally in that

181
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,590
localized information ecosystem so when

182
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,640
we go in there we are looking at OS seus

183
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,810
about the what does it sound like

184
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,370
self-centered using the messenger and

185
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,490
spinning right so what we focus on is

186
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,200
what do people what did people talk

187
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,890
about because what people talk about can

188
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,700
be very very revealing and when we

189
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,020
realized in Liberia that the amount of

190
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,490
factual and fact-based stories that our

191
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,770
journalism partners could get out was

192
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,930
just being completely swamped by the

193
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,150
word on the street on the grapevine

194
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,549
through social media even in the tiniest

195
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,610
village by word of mouth we realized

196
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,080
that that we had to develop a new kind

197
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,479
of programming to deal with that and we

198
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,099
got together with UNICEF who had health

199
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,809
workers going door-to-door in these

200
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,839
affected villages to give them yet again

201
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,500
the facts and the public health service

202
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,480
messages and we asked them to stick

203
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,190
around and just kind

204
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,180
say you know other than Ebola what's up

205
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,320
what's going on

206
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,100
what else he worried about because and

207
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,060
we found amazingly that there was a lot

208
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,980
of information which had that health

209
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,310
worker not stuck around and just kind of

210
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,420
kicked the can around with those people

211
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,000
for a little while a lot of information

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,800
that was extremely interesting about

213
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,570
what people's real concerns were that

214
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,930
were not about necessarily what is Ebola

215
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,270
explained germ theory to me but about

216
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,270
schools about government corruption

217
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,420
about roads about trade about food about

218
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,630
voodoo about magic about economics and

219
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,210
we call that Ebola related content now

220
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,770
it's not necessarily Public Health

221
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,530
content but it has a lot of really

222
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,710
interesting implications for how the

223
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,110
response to that crisis will go and how

224
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,600
messaging may be adjusted the message of

225
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,150
Ebola kills for instance was really not

226
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,130
helpful when people started to survive

227
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,150
Ebola it completely undermined the major

228
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,160
Public Health Service message that that

229
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,470
response had relied upon and sewed

230
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,630
mistrust among people who were then like

231
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,810
hey you know we're not we not now not

232
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,910
inclined to believe anything that you

233
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,980
say how do people talk about it what

234
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,650
language do they use and why do they

235
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,040
talk about it is as interesting because

236
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,890
the business of rumor is so rich it's a

237
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,780
revealing of what people's real fears

238
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,080
are fear has been mentioned a lot in the

239
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,190
room today people in unstable or weak

240
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,930
democracies where there are weak health

241
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,120
systems where there's been a civil war

242
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,790
for instance and where there are always

243
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,920
deemed cultural perhaps religious

244
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,230
political reasons why people are

245
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,150
predisposed to believe a rumor that is

246
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,560
much more interesting to us and where

247
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,630
that rumor came from what the agenda was

248
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,190
of the person who sewed the rumor in the

249
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,440
first place if it was deliberate but

250
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,210
when people are asking questions that is

251
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,400
revealing of their fear and it reveals

252
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,560
an information gap what does they really

253
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,760
want to know and if you can meet that

254
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,130
information gap you have a half a chance

255
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,900
of establishing trust with those people

256
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,270
through which you then may start to drip

257
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,779
feed your

258
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,670
facts with a greater certainty that they

259
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,589
are going to actually pick it up because

260
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:16,540
Trust is everything in this business so

261
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,050
demand-driven localized news so the

262
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,620
fact-checking network is fabulous we

263
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,800
work we use those facts but we need to

264
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,629
localize down to the most affected

265
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,129
communities it's very difficult with the

266
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,990
coronavirus to decide where exactly

267
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,699
those are because everybody seems to be

268
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:36,939
vulnerable to the info demek but in due

269
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:38,709
course it may become evident where the

270
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,629
most at-risk communities are you need to

271
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:42,459
get down there and understand their

272
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,410
localized information ecosystem and try

273
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,600
to work within that to address it for

274
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,029
inter news what is a rumor it can be a

275
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,639
hey did you hear it can be a criticism

276
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,949
they're trying to make money out of this

277
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:55,600
there's an agenda behind it

278
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,240
a general throwaway comment or is it

279
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,889
true that or I heard that or have you

280
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,629
heard or did you know that kind of peek

281
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,249
behind the secret I'm letting you in on

282
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:04,930
a secret here which somebody described

283
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,300
brilliantly earlier it's a data point

284
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,059
for inter news a rumor or a conversation

285
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:13,629
a concern is a data point these come

286
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:16,509
from Nepal from Haiti and from Greece

287
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,459
respectively these are rumors we call

288
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,559
them rumors as a short turned it sounds

289
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,629
wild like a rumors like a wacky thing

290
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,809
but it's not really it's just it's a

291
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,620
it's a concern of some sort these are

292
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,569
the information services that we bring

293
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:34,269
we assess local information ecosystems

294
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:36,660
to understand who the influencers are

295
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,910
because in the chaos of social media in

296
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,800
particular influencers are super

297
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,720
important in local communities and

298
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,579
faraway places they tend to have a

299
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:46,870
different flavor but it's super

300
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,079
important to have those people on boards

301
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,429
engaging with local media is always

302
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:54,100
going to be important communication with

303
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,860
communities is a two-way process this is

304
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,290
not messaging which we have already

305
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,120
established is not necessarily helpful

306
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,160
it's always ensuring that wherever you

307
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,870
are delivering some information to

308
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,790
somebody there is a clear path for that

309
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,879
person to speak back to you to ask their

310
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,819
question to express their particular

311
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:17,829
idiosyncratic little concern and that

312
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:19,839
you will go away and you will come back

313
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,019
the following week with your with with

314
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,370
the additional information that that

315
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,129
person used which is exactly what we did

316
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:31,600
in Liberia so the key I would say here

317
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,310
bullet point to the key is to have a

318
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,379
conversation not to do another survey or

319
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:38,819
assessment so we literally I think the

320
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,689
anthropologists and social scientists

321
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,430
that we work with call it deep hanging

322
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,589
out it is really that kind of shooting

323
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,839
the breeze on the doorstep stuff people

324
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,360
rumor is everywhere people love to talk

325
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,009
about what they heard today because they

326
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:52,870
do have fear and they want to check it

327
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,399
that's the stuff that we're interested

328
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,920
in so we have teams going out into

329
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,050
communities they may not be into news we

330
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,939
don't have armies of people everywhere

331
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,560
but we might partner with the Red Cross

332
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,649
for instance or UNICEF or people who do

333
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,180
have boots on the ground who are face to

334
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,459
face with many many people and we just

335
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,740
ask them to keep their ears open and

336
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,680
gather and then so we collect all of

337
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,990
these data points open questioning is

338
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,910
very important as opposed to survey

339
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,529
tick-box questioning let the

340
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,779
conversation flow this is what those

341
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,309
data points look like when they're

342
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:26,350
trapped we don't need to know people's

343
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,089
names we don't need to know where they

344
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:32,019
came from so data security wise it's

345
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:35,350
relatively light and we do not pick what

346
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,779
the most important rumors are it's not

347
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,269
about prevalence because it really

348
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:41,920
doesn't matter if most people believe

349
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,240
that the moon is made of green cheese

350
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,670
but it might matter if somebody believes

351
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,309
that this border is open and they can

352
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:50,680
cross it when they can't or that it's

353
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,889
safe to bury a body after Ebola those

354
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:55,449
are going to be dangerous causes of

355
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:58,389
action so in analyzing this data we look

356
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:59,829
for we have to make a kind of a

357
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:03,730
journalistic almost editorial decisions

358
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,769
about which rumors even if small may

359
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,769
lead to endangering behaviors these are

360
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:10,809
the kinds of places that we go to look

361
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,139
for quotes commentary fact-checking etc

362
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:15,879
and now we have our fact-checking

363
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,350
Network partners which is wonderful

364
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,720
these are typically the kind of people

365
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,209
who would go to and we produce bulletins

366
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,569
that look we produce bulletins for the

367
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:28,360
community the bulletins reflect back the

368
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,040
rumor and exactly the way it was

369
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,630
expressed to us in the lingo in the

370
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,120
local

371
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,080
go of the place in Liberia it was called

372
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,040
Deise which is they say which is the

373
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
local you know slang for the word on the

374
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,200
street or suck D suck Frei in Haiti what

375
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,510
is said and what is true we create a

376
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,330
bulletin that goes to local media local

377
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,940
influences local content producers

378
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,070
whoever they may go over they may be

379
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,350
Imams and others and then for

380
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,279
humanitarians this is really important

381
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,570
this could be local government it could

382
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,860
be national government it could be these

383
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,000
off this is for service providers

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,360
because service providers find it so

385
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,860
fascinating and useful to understand

386
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,170
what people are saying because very

387
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,980
often they're not saying anything

388
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,680
necessarily about the virus itself but

389
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,730
they're saying something about the

390
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,350
quality of service and information that

391
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,360
they're receiving and the level of trust

392
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,150
that they have in it so we have there

393
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,910
there it is the rumor at the top

394
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,720
Anonymous but with a reference to

395
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,630
location here comes the fact that we

396
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,240
have fact-checked somehow with a quote

397
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,270
and then we have a referral here you can

398
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,880
go for more information here you can go

399
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,560
to find somebody who will take action

400
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,410
for you and so this loop needs to

401
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,790
continue we never take data from the

402
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,130
from people without going back to them

403
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,770
with some sorts of answers referrals and

404
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,800
information for follow-up and I assume

405
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,089
because you're standing there my time is

406
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,950
out Thanks

407
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,809
[Applause]
