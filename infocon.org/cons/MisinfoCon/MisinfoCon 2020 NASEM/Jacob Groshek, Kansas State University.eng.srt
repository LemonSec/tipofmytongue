1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,110
what I want to talk to you today is

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,049
about a project where we looked at

3
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:05,819
monitoring of social media to identify

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,649
hubs that have Miss information

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,530
regarding health of course there's a lot

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,179
of previous studies that focus on this

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,950
and especially looking at those that are

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,929
most active and sharing and discussing

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,150
health topics on socially may in fact be

10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,980
less knowledgeable this can of course

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,900
exacerbate problems related to the rapid

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,359
spread of misinformation one of the

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,279
things that we focused on at Boston

14
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,230
University where I worked before and

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,849
maintain an affiliation as well as

16
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,890
Kansas State University where I'm now

17
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,530
Research Chair is that we look at

18
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,969
network analysis as a way to identify

19
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,219
hubs of misinformation and influential

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,829
users so we use a variety of metrics to

21
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,559
identify who is influential in terms of

22
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,300
not only what's being said but how it's

23
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,620
being communicated and passed through

24
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,420
the network so we use a series of

25
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,910
metrics from network analysis to

26
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,160
identify those typically we size our

27
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,860
nodes using what's known as it between

28
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,320
the centrality algorithm we identify

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,660
communities by applying the modularity

30
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,579
algorithm to color our graphs and then

31
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,170
we spatialize them using underlying

32
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,460
network structures I think the most

33
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,290
important thing here for us is that

34
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,820
these are starting points for us to

35
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,280
identify not only hubs of quality

36
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,290
information but also potential hubs of

37
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,540
misinformation so this is a way for us

38
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,340
to start looking at users and then to

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,960
dive into content but also to look at

40
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,670
profiles and to get a better sense of

41
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,369
who is saying what to whom and with what

42
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,490
effect so very briefly I'm going to

43
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,380
introduce this not only as a process but

44
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,659
also as a platform that perhaps all of

45
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,400
you may be interested to engage which we

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,470
offer for free and that collects

47
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,479
hundreds of millions of units of data on

48
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,780
an ongoing basis so here's a couple of

49
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,170
examples over the years we've looked at

50
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,670
antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance

51
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,860
of course it doesn't take much effort

52
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,420
here to figure out who is influential

53
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,899
and talking about antibiotics here right

54
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:00,990
if you can't make Hillary Clinton indeed

55
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,490
so what does Hillary Clinton had to do

56
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,479
with antibiotics

57
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,740
I see a few knobs shaking of the head so

58
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,119
this data was collected over the course

59
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,038
of some years we have about 2.5 million

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,380
you

61
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,570
it's Hillary Clinton is quote-unquote

62
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,700
influential in discussing antibiotics

63
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,520
because she had pneumonia in 2016 when

64
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,290
she was running for president which

65
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,450
meant that many people went online and

66
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,980
say hey Hillary because you have

67
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,090
pneumonia you should get some

68
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,040
antibiotics now what's interesting about

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,520
this graph is that it's wrong this is

70
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,140
what's known as an undirected graph

71
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,360
which is to say it doesn't look at what

72
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,860
Hillary Clinton was actually saying and

73
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,630
doing around the topic she didn't tweet

74
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,490
at all about antibiotics but what this

75
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,650
allows us to do is to identify ways to

76
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,690
leverage our message such that we can

77
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,750
move indicators around topics like

78
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,520
antibiotics and whether or not she

79
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,110
really should be seeking treatment for

80
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,390
her pneumonia with antibiotics or not

81
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,790
because as you may know pneumonia itself

82
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,400
can be viral or bacterial and if it's

83
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,050
viral it wouldn't actually benefit from

84
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,910
being treated if we change the nature of

85
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,320
our graph just a little bit it can be

86
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,420
more correct and we can identify here

87
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,760
many other nodes of so-called ordinary

88
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,190
users who are also likewise influential

89
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,960
in discussing this topic now the

90
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,220
challenge here of course is this is

91
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,260
filter the wheat from the chaff which is

92
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,510
to say some of these users may be

93
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,190
spreading misinformation some of them

94
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,080
may be spreading quality information but

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,090
this again is why it is a useful we

96
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,400
think starting point because we can take

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,310
literally hundreds of millions of posts

98
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,960
we can filter them down to the most

99
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,370
influential users we can identify

100
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,560
communities and typically when we look

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,360
at those colors of the community usually

102
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,340
those folks are sharing information with

103
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,840
one another that is either of a high

104
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,880
quality or low quality nature so it

105
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,850
makes our jobs essentially a lot easier

106
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,400
to route out sources of misinformation

107
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,050
if they do exist

108
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,630
of course this gets us to the next level

109
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,670
which is to say we can look at text and

110
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,520
I was one of the panels earlier today

111
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,640
and we mentioned the importance of humor

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,910
over the course of a year looking at a

113
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,980
full firehose access to Twitter data the

114
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,250
most retweeted post was about

115
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,780
antibiotics doctor why did you take an

116
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,310
antibiotic medicine at 6 a.m. when I

117
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,270
told you 9:00 a.m.

118
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,100
patient I wanted to surprise the

119
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,550
bacterial humor right this is the most

120
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,370
shared tweet about antibiotics in our

121
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,320
data set which covers everything over

122
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,270
the course of the year so we can use

123
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,550
these sorts of things in

124
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,620
effective way even though of course we

125
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,229
know that surprising bacteria may not be

126
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:29,789
effective in helping to treat whatever

127
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:31,680
condition we have so the point that I'm

128
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,789
trying to illustrate here is that we

129
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,800
have a wide range of users sharing a

130
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,990
wide diverse body of content the first

131
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,750
user there Hacha

132
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,349
Shanghai Chang's hozy is an ordinary

133
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,979
person not an expert in antibiotics or

134
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,990
microbial resistance nonetheless has the

135
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,569
most retweeted post of the whole year

136
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:53,729
the w-h-o more science news of course

137
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:54,960
are a little more established as

138
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,849
verified users on the account which

139
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,039
allows us to look at different levels of

140
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,449
how information flows through the

141
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,050
network and what can be leveraged in

142
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,490
that sense which points back to the

143
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,440
Hillary Clinton example so I'm going to

144
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,990
skip a little bit quickly over this just

145
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,400
because I believe we're probably

146
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,800
straight up out of time and I think

147
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,719
there's still one other presenter but

148
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:17,550
the way that a lot of this data is

149
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,259
collected is through what's known as the

150
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,180
Twitter collection and analysis toolkit

151
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,009
which was produced by the digital mesh

152
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:25,139
methods initiative at the University of

153
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,479
Amsterdam just to say this thing lives

154
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,849
and breathes online and continues to

155
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:31,590
collect data on an ongoing basis from

156
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,750
the stream API or the so called garden

157
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,490
how is access to Twitter and you can

158
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,069
offload this data to visualize it with

159
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,529
Jaffee are analyzed that if in Excel

160
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,900
SPSS so on and so forth and again

161
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,490
whether or not you're studying

162
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,650
antibiotics you're studying coronavirus

163
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,949
we have at the moment about 8.5 bill

164
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,500
sorry 8.5 million tweets about the

165
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,940
corona virus which we started collecting

166
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,460
about two and a half weeks ago

167
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,580
this runs essentially for free we have

168
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,580
about 450 million tweets on a variety of

169
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,509
topics on T cat that we host on AWS and

170
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:09,120
a series of virtual machines you know

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,440
why should you really care we can use

172
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,879
this data for a lot of purposes we can

173
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,529
do ethnographies we can do network

174
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:15,389
analysis we can look at content we can

175
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,580
look at users if I had more time I could

176
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,349
give you a little bit of a working data

177
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:23,340
a working demo but effectively this data

178
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,900
provides pretty clear access to what

179
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,490
people are doing in terms of what

180
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,900
they're saying who they're saying to

181
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,330
whether or not they may be BOTS or they

182
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,880
may be trolls or agents or they may have

183
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,409
as some of our example showed earlier

184
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,000
they may have been

185
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,830
suspended that is quite a challenge

186
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,360
working in this sort of data is that

187
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,100
accounts that can be influential one day

188
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,600
over the period of time disappear

189
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,150
because they suspend this accounts are

190
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,660
suspended for violating rules being bots

191
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,660
among other things so we have a lot of

192
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,060
broad topically agnostic ignosi

193
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,670
topically agnostic value to this so if

194
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,010
you are interested and you would like to

195
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,020
have a look at the data we have you can

196
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,470
go to this URL I know it's not fancy but

197
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,020
it will get you there you can use the

198
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,110
username Katy cats password XY one two

199
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,010
three hat - hats

200
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,350
exclamation mark try to keep your data

201
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,290
query small that system can break it

202
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,380
takes a long time to prepare in terms of

203
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,860
a working example I had the question for

204
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,260
a demo here we don't have time but if

205
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,970
you want to have a quick look as you can

206
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,020
see here we have as I mentioned the

207
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,930
coronavirus so we've collected I'm sorry

208
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,110
9.1 million tweets from February 2nd

209
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,490
till now

210
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,010
this will keep collecting dates about

211
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,960
collecting data tweets about this topic

212
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,810
until we tell it to stop I was wrong I

213
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,010
guess we only have four hundred thirty

214
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,479
million tweets not four hundred fifty

215
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,100
thousand four hundred fifty million and

216
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,140
there's a variety of ways to query this

217
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,790
data set you can look at it over time

218
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,229
you can include things you can exclude

219
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,760
things you can drill down and you can

220
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,040
track things you can identify who's

221
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,460
saying what's who's the most potent

222
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,470
quote influential and I know I'm

223
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,430
scrolling through this kind of quickly

224
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,400
but the goal here is just to bring to

225
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,020
your attention that this is out there if

226
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,610
you want to use it I'm happy to take

227
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,169
questions and support whatever research

228
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,690
inquiries you might have in mind and

229
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,100
it's also worth pointing out that these

230
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,260
searches are customizable which is to

231
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,390
say if we're not collecting something

232
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,460
that's of interest to you and from this

233
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,020
drop-down you can see all of the many

234
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,339
different things that we're collecting

235
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,229
data on from the election to Amazon

236
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,909
Apple astrology I started collecting

237
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,500
tweets about Bernie being a Russian

238
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,080
asset yesterday

239
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,390
seven thousand seven hundred tweets came

240
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,959
back already concussions culture so on

241
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,490
and so forth a lot of these queries have

242
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,600
nothing to do with what I'm interested

243
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,700
in but rather rather what people in the

244
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,110
scholarly community are interesting and

245
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,860
pursuing so again free data no cost let

246
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,440
me know and if we do have another

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,360
speaker I'm happy to turn the stage over

248
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,610
but also happy to take questions thanks

249
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,470
for your time

250
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,960
[Applause]
