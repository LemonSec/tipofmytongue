1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,460
well thank you everybody thank you for

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,250
having me here today as I mentioned I'm

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,080
a Senior Program Officer here at the

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,490
National Academies of Sciences

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,559
engineering and medicine and that means

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,429
I direct the consensus reports that

7
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:15,360
David mentioned and I'm going to go

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,619
through a couple of them today that

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,109
specifically focused on science literacy

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,090
health literacy and science

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,240
communication just to review as David

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,000
said we are three honorific academies as

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,340
well as an operating arm that advises

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,230
the nation on science health and

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,850
medicine something we've been doing

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,860
since the 1860s and I just like to

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,719
reiterate what David said that all of

18
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,840
our advice is provided by volunteers we

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,670
do not have a line-item budget from the

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,180
government we are commissioned to do

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,850
work on relevant science topics and we

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,460
enlist the nation's experts to help us

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,770
make that possible so in the last few

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,120
years we've been asked to look into

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,438
three topics that are very relevant to

26
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:07,890
us today in 2016 we put out a report on

27
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,860
science literacy that is what it is and

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,320
how it's relevant to the public support

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,400
of science the report noted that science

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,409
literacy includes understanding

31
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:22,470
scientific concepts and practices such

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,360
as the forming and testing of a

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,759
hypothesis the relationship between

34
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,670
probability and risk and the difference

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,189
between causation and correlation

36
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:33,180
something that probably most of us in

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,829
this room understand but that can be

38
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,540
very hard to communicate to a lay

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,479
audience or someone who doesn't have

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,049
high science literacy exposure science

41
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,090
also includes knowledge obviously about

42
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,920
a science or a field of science

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,899
including basic facts concepts and

44
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,149
relevant vocabulary and it includes the

45
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,890
understanding that science is a process

46
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,479
a social process so not just an

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,369
experiment but that it involves a

48
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,469
criteria by which someone is identified

49
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,770
as an expert the process of peer review

50
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,390
that David mentioned to make sure that

51
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,788
the scientific findings are valid and

52
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,860
disclosure is about sources of funding

53
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,750
and conflicts of interest

54
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,140
and knowing these things about science

55
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,910
literacy helps individuals when they

56
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,680
want to use science in their lives

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,720
interact with science information and

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,070
make decisions that are based on science

59
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,420
science literacy is tested or understood

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,690
largely with surveys public opinion

61
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,340
surveys that are distributed and there

62
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,690
are a number that have been distributed

63
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,130
not only in the US but around the world

64
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,730
and from those surveys we know that US

65
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,190
the knowledge of US adults of on science

66
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,459
is comparable to that of other developed

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,650
economies but what we also know is that

68
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,030
while there's a small positive

69
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,590
relationship between general knowledge

70
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,810
and attitude to science when you go down

71
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,850
to the next level to specific scientific

72
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,850
issues that not that general scientific

73
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,560
knowledge doesn't necessarily translate

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,450
into support a specific scientific

75
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,330
issues that people's knowledge is

76
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,690
affected by their religiosity their

77
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,670
political dispositions their worldviews

78
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,500
and their deference to scientific

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,300
authority and so when there are

80
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,580
controversial issues in science just

81
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,959
because you have a greater knowledge of

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,450
the topic doesn't mean that you'll agree

83
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,459
more it can actually lead to increased

84
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,430
polarization and people will often tend

85
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,709
to seek as we see in the political

86
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,390
sphere we also see in the science fear

87
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,070
that people often seek information

88
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,019
that's consistent with their views or

89
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,030
they avoid information that would be

90
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,170
inconsistent with what they already

91
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,060
think and the report

92
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,060
lastly the report noted that while we

93
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,280
know a great deal about individual

94
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,049
scientific literacy there's also a lot

95
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,630
to learn about community and societal

96
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,410
literacy when it comes to societies the

97
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,100
evidence is rather dismal people have

98
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,570
difficulty with scientific literacy

99
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,829
because they have a difficulty with

100
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,570
foundational literacy that is just the

101
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,310
ability to process oral written and

102
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,079
graphic information and to be able to

103
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,970
apply that information to further

104
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,970
learning and while the committee that

105
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,410
conducted this report couldn't find

106
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,420
examples of that that specific related

107
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,608
to scientific literacy it makes sense

108
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,010
that if you have a basic in a challenge

109
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,710
in reading period that then you're gonna

110
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,860
have even more of a challenge with

111
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,039
with accessing scientific information

112
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:29,629
when it comes to community scientific

113
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:32,599
learning literacy they found that

114
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,520
communities are able to work in concert

115
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
to contribute to the overall well-being

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,939
through sufficient shared capacity to

117
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:40,129
address a scientific issue and that they

118
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,020
can in turn collect information and

119
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,939
share that knowledge with scientists

120
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:46,189
there is case based evidence to show

121
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,870
that community involvement has helped to

122
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,000
bring new questions to light provide

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,530
data that would otherwise be unavailable

124
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,810
to scientific problems and produce new

125
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,379
instruments and technologies and I only

126
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,940
know this anecdotally I don't know that

127
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,159
this was I think this report was before

128
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,539
this but I think we saw some of that

129
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,400
happen in the Flint water incident in

130
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
Michigan where the community banded

131
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,599
together tested their water and applied

132
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:13,520
that learning to the to the problem so

133
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,870
overall the report concluded that

134
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,370
although there's a positive relationship

135
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,680
between literacy and attitudes that

136
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,750
support science that doesn't mean that

137
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,939
support for science in general will

138
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,099
translate into increased scientific

139
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:28,610
literacy it doesn't always also project

140
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,550
that an individual will have a an

141
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,379
individual that cyant literate that

142
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:35,150
doesn't predict necessarily what they

143
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,680
will think about a specific science

144
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,460
topic and some some topics such as

145
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,199
genetic engineering or vaccines two

146
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,879
topics we frequently address here at the

147
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,289
National Academies can be so connected

148
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:51,379
to people's individual world views or

149
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,469
religiosity or what they think about the

150
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:56,569
nature of science in general that just

151
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,129
because they support science doesn't

152
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,680
mean they will necessarily endorse a

153
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,449
specific scientific finding about a

154
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,789
particular topic

155
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:07,219
therefore it's likely that efforts to

156
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:08,659
simply promote more knowledge about

157
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,029
science are unlikely to influence how

158
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,639
people think about science and therefore

159
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,469
efforts should focus on not only

160
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:17,379
increasing knowledge but also in

161
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,550
removing impediments to action and

162
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,800
letterers lowering the literacy demand

163
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,050
in particular situations future

164
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,789
scientific future research on science

165
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,129
literacy should focus on what kind of

166
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,539
conditions are needed and what type of

167
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,139
knowledge is needed to be acquired to

168
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,550
affect individual attitudes and

169
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,170
behaviors related to

170
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,040
I should have mentioned that the

171
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,630
National Academy saw our reports we

172
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,070
definitely have like what more research

173
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,740
is needed rarely be a national category

174
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,330
report if we didn't identify what else

175
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,150
we need to know to what extent do the

176
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,100
measures of scientific lira see mapped

177
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,300
people's ability to accomplish

178
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,970
scientific specific tasks such as

179
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,350
understanding science and health

180
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,570
messages choosing between competing

181
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,760
sources of information or identifying

182
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,880
expertise or modifying their behavior

183
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,160
and how can we measure understand and

184
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,630
support the future structures and

185
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,610
circumstances of communities that make

186
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,160
it possible for them to engage

187
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,270
collectively and use science so turning

188
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,210
to health literacy in 2004 so much

189
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,860
earlier than the previous report I just

190
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,090
talked about the National Academies

191
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,760
release this landmark report at the time

192
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,830
it was unappreciated that nearly half of

193
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,560
US adults struggled with health literacy

194
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,940
that is when they encountered the

195
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,370
healthcare system millions of patients

196
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,020
were not able to comprehend their

197
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,940
condition and treatment to make the best

198
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,400
decisions for their care or to take the

199
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,380
right medications at the right time in

200
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,800
the intended dose so this this report

201
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,050
really shined a spotlight on that

202
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,680
problem and helped create a wide range

203
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,210
of tools and practices to help

204
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,130
organizations from large healthcare

205
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,350
systems to individual care providers to

206
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,930
engage with health literate discussions

207
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,540
and provide health literate material to

208
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,580
patients and family members and the

209
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,200
National Academies has continued that

210
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,210
work in the last decade and a half

211
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,280
through the roundtable on health

212
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,710
literacy which is a body of experts that

213
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,690
hold an workshops several workshops a

214
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,850
year that inform inspire and activate a

215
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,310
wide range of stakeholders to support

216
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,140
the development implementation and

217
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,610
sharing of evidence-based health

218
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,620
literacy practices and they do this in a

219
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,680
number of topics so they've looked at

220
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,010
how can you better communicate to

221
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,140
patients the correct dosage of

222
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,049
medication to take they've also looked

223
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,570
at the difficulty of navigating the

224
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,669
healthcare system particularly when so

225
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,140
many people came into the healthcare

226
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,270
system after the Affordable Care Act was

227
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,790
passed who might not have encountered

228
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,890
encountered regular health care before

229
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,590
how can how can

230
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,280
better communicate to that population

231
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,660
they've looked into specific conditions

232
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,570
this week this workshop report on people

233
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,880
suffering from cancer was just published

234
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
and it also not only does it look at how

235
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,960
we can communicate better with people

236
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,940
who are battling cancer but also how can

237
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,500
we communicate better so that people

238
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,050
never get cancer in the first place but

239
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,650
preventative measures can they take also

240
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,020
people dealing with behavioral and

241
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,640
mental health issues often have an

242
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,140
extreme challenge when it comes to

243
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,200
communicating health literate messages

244
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,040
to them and then palliative care at

245
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,780
people at the end-of-life decisions are

246
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,550
people who are in pain what is the best

247
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,090
way to communicate messages to them

248
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,170
there's also many different types of

249
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,940
populations in the u.s. of course the

250
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,350
older population being one of the

251
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,540
fastest growing and and we also know

252
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,670
that older populations are also highly

253
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,890
correlated with low health literacy so

254
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,260
how do we communicate to to this

255
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,290
population the United States is becoming

256
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,570
increasingly diverse and include in

257
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,880
terms of ethnicity as well as culturally

258
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,580
how do we bring all of these populations

259
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,560
into the healthcare system I make sure

260
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,880
they're getting the appropriate care and

261
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,790
they're understanding it and people with

262
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,200
disabilities are also extremely

263
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,750
vulnerable in the health system how do

264
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,720
we make sure that they are receiving the

265
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,080
information that they need as I

266
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,910
mentioned with the with the science

267
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,490
literacy community based health literacy

268
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,010
is also very important so the community

269
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,470
has that worked the I'm sorry the

270
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,600
roundtable has also taken a look at what

271
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,250
we know about community based health

272
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,290
literacy intervention interventions and

273
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,110
and then they've also kind of taken a

274
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,270
step back and saying said okay following

275
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,750
the 2004 report a decade or so on what

276
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,400
do we know about health literacy bowls

277
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,890
for the individual and for larger

278
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,140
communities and why is it so important

279
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,600
like let's reiterate this two reports it

280
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,570
didn't mention one that's about to come

281
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,190
out and then a workshop that's being

282
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,840
held in the future we also held a

283
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,050
workshop in November about communicating

284
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,970
to youth who are of course getting a lot

285
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,720
of their information

286
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,360
online who may or may not be consulting

287
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,769
with adults when they're consuming

288
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,540
health information and so what kind of

289
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,300
information do do younger people need to

290
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,009
make good decisions about their their

291
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:14,350
own health and then coming up in May the

292
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,089
committee the round table will be

293
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,290
holding a workshop on health

294
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,810
misinformation so it's very timely along

295
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,970
the same vein we held a we had a

296
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,170
committee that worked on how to

297
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,509
effectively communicate science to the

298
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:32,649
population and I think nobody in this

299
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:33,819
room would be surprised that that's

300
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,370
extreme challenge because science is not

301
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,589
always certain and as I mentioned with

302
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:40,889
the first report it's a process so

303
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:42,790
getting people to understand that

304
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,319
process and then communicating a message

305
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,810
that's consistent and not misinterpret

306
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,889
not misinterpreted is is a challenge so

307
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,720
one thing that the committee identified

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,129
they identified a couple cross-cutting

309
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,110
issues and one is communicating is

310
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,180
aligning communication approaches with

311
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,029
goals not every audience is the same and

312
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:02,829
so not every communication strategy

313
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,660
should be the same and what can we learn

314
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,209
as as a scientific communication

315
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,069
endeavour about how we communicate to

316
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:12,339
those different audiences also they just

317
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,769
put a nail in the coffin of

318
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:17,230
the deficit model as I mentioned earlier

319
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,089
giving people more information is not

320
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,579
necessarily going to make them agree

321
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,170
with what you said because of all the

322
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,120
motivating reasons that I listed earlier

323
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,309
and then there are a number of

324
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:29,589
challenges to study because science

325
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:31,689
communication as like as a research

326
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:36,160
field of study is still evolving so we

327
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,370
need to understand that intersection

328
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,170
between like what individuals think and

329
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,939
what society brings to bear in them and

330
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:44,949
then how messages about science are

331
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,670
understood we need to rethink how we

332
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,829
communicate with policymakers I think we

333
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,439
all know that a policymaker can have the

334
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,910
just like any individual they can have

335
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,110
the best science available and that

336
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,509
doesn't necessarily drive the decisions

337
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:01,089
they make so how do we get scientific

338
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,610
messages just not across to policymakers

339
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,410
but actually have it influence their the

340
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,009
decisions that they go forward with

341
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,240
engaging formally with the public about

342
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,059
science what are the best structures for

343
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,279
public engagement to make sure

344
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,589
we communicate effectively and what

345
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,329
approaches can be generalized and what

346
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:20,620
approaches need to be tailored to

347
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,430
specific audiences as always when when

348
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,170
science is involved in a controversy

349
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,029
people bring their emotions they bring

350
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,410
their previous knowledge they bring

351
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,839
their worldviews to that issue and how

352
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,970
can we engage the public in a way that

353
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,709
allows us to get to some sort of

354
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,019
consensus David mentioned like excuse me

355
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,430
David mentioned the consensus process

356
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,949
that we go through on the committee to

357
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:44,620
get to a resolution we have obviously

358
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,660
not found a great way of doing this as a

359
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,670
society and what can we learn about how

360
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,629
to how to improve upon that when we when

361
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:54,999
we talk about science controversies as a

362
00:13:54,999 --> 00:14:00,220
as a culture in a nation obviously the

363
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,199
media landscape is proliferated a great

364
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,629
deal in the in the last decade or so and

365
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:06,699
so we're not just communicating through

366
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,860
print and three major networks we're

367
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,430
communicating through a onslaught of

368
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,889
cable options as well as online options

369
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,769
and so how do we keep a message that's

370
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,829
consistent easily understood and

371
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:23,949
accessible across all that media and

372
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:26,709
then we need to as with all like

373
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:28,899
endeavors to learn we need to assess

374
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,139
what we've learned from these um from

375
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,730
these scientific experiments on

376
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,350
communication and then and then feed

377
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,170
that back in so we can learn more so as

378
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,050
a scientist of course the report called

379
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,430
for randomized controlled field

380
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,649
experiments to access impact which may

381
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,120
have been difficult to do in one time

382
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,040
but now of course with the feedback of

383
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,889
our online systems perhaps this is

384
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,660
something that would be more easily

385
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,670
achievable and in putting out a message

386
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,740
and getting easy feedback in quick

387
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,439
feedback and then and that would also

388
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,660
apply to research that simulates real

389
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,759
world real world communication

390
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,759
environments and then analyzing the the

391
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,829
datasets that we have on how people

392
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:11,529
interact with with science messages and

393
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,179
how we can use that information to

394
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,629
improve communication so I just like to

395
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,429
say that we at the academies have tried

396
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:20,410
to take some lessons from our own

397
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,540
reports and have recently launched a

398
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,769
small project on communicating directly

399
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,870
to a lay audience about

400
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,900
about science and health questions this

401
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,180
is our based on science website we've

402
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,520
tackled a couple of problems there's a

403
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,350
small number of problems that are that

404
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,200
are commonly asked on the web but and

405
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,970
often have specious information

406
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,820
associated with them and which we can

407
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,650
draw on our body of expertise to answer

408
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,300
and these aren't always the kind of

409
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,330
questions that that our sponsors come to

410
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,340
us to answer these are the answer these

411
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,630
are the kind of questions that people

412
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,400
type into Google at 11 o'clock at night

413
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,320
and so we have a few articles about

414
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,780
fluoride fluoridated water of course

415
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,820
vaccines seems to be a perennial issue

416
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,050
unfortunately miracle cures for cancer

417
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,760
you know people are in pain and they're

418
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,290
looking for answers and they're looking

419
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,450
for solutions that might either be less

420
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,060
painful or less cost prohibitive but a

421
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,010
lot of those solutions that are offered

422
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,880
are obviously uneffective and and are

423
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,500
actually being proposed by somebody

424
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,970
who's trying to profit off someone's

425
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,230
pain and so can we just provide one more

426
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,210
data point of information to people that

427
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,480
this is not incredible and then of

428
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,420
course climate change just we have a

429
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,640
great deal of number of reports on

430
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,870
climate change as David mentioned

431
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,330
there's a Wikipedia editor thon going on

432
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,880
with a focus on climate today but our

433
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,670
reports are long dense and thorough and

434
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,740
how can we distill that information into

435
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,900
a way that people can access quickly and

436
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,750
find online through search easily this

437
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,270
is just an example of of one of our

438
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,160
articles so it's very very short and so

439
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,440
it was easy to fit on a slide just

440
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,440
debunking that sunscreen will not make

441
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,000
you vitamin D deficient it's very

442
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,359
important to use and and does prevent

443
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,430
skin cancer and so that's something we

444
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,990
hope to expand this is the type of

445
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,609
program we hope to expand upon in the

446
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,319
future to make a little bit more content

447
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,020
readily available to to a broader

448
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,910
audience so again thank you for having

449
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,060
me and I look forward to the rest of the

450
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,940
presentations this morning

451
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:33,079
[Applause]
