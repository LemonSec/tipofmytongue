1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
yes hello good morning I make science

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,270
videos I thought I'd start with this

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,550
sort of famous piece of science

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,070
communication this is a diagram that was

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,710
created by Florence Nightingale a lot of

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,269
people think of her as you know pioneer

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,670
medicine but she was also really into

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,230
data visualization and this shows the

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,869
deaths in the Crimean War so each of

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,760
these wheels is a year each of the

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,599
wedges is a month and the red area is

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,090
the deaths from wounds and the blue area

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,969
is the deaths from disease so you can

14
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,649
see that point she's trying to get

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,050
across here if we can stop disease or

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,579
our soldiers will be in a lot better

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,230
shape this particular diagram is a polar

18
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,510
area diagram and it's sort of a weird

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,200
cousin of chart that was invented a few

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,140
decades before this by William Playfair

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,780
that you probably recognize as the pie

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,280
chart very popular chart for for the

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,180
populace but people really hate it who

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,030
study data visualization here's some

25
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,570
quotes from some folks who are sort of

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,710
data vis gurus who basically say death

27
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,630
to pie charts and the reason they say

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,640
this is because humans are really bad at

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,810
estimating areas and the relative sizes

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,000
of wedges and comparing angles and

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,979
they're much better at comparing lengths

32
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,460
so bar charts are usually a better way

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,460
to go there are some people who argue

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,020
that hey if you want to give sort of a

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,000
vague impression of a binary choice

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,450
between say yes votes and no votes pie

37
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,729
chart is a good way to go but other

38
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,869
people would say well a bar chart would

39
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,270
be even better and this is a little bit

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,500
of foreshadowing because I am going to

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,119
be using pie charts later in this

42
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,970
presentation

43
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,009
so some scientists took the data from

44
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,409
that first graphic that I showed the

45
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,149
Florence Nightingale graphic and plotted

46
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,399
it as just a simple line graph and I

47
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,090
think that it does show things a bit

48
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,000
more clearly if you compare them

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,788
Florence 90 Gil's diagram is a little

50
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,889
bit harder to understand like the time

51
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,960
is not used very intuitively it is

52
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,370
it has that same problem that pipe

53
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,740
charts have where it's hard to estimate

54
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,760
relative areas but I think that a lot of

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
people might be more drawn to her

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,180
graphic they might find it more

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,130
beautiful people in this room might feel

58
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,040
more comfortable with this line graph

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,870
but I think a lot of people when they

60
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,760
see this think ooh I want to like learn

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,990
more about that it's a little a little

62
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,230
more enticing and that's true for pie

63
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,700
charts in general this is an early study

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,220
from 1926 about how effective pie charts

65
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,170
are and they found that a large majority

66
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,480
of people prefer them to bar graphs and

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,850
maybe that's because humans are very

68
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,550
into circles they like these shapes it's

69
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,430
very pleasant for us to look at we have

70
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,550
this aesthetic affinity for pie charts

71
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,980
this happens to be a bunch of pie charts

72
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,190
that show the dominant colors used by

73
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,550
different impressionist artists around

74
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,250
the turn of the century but yeah it

75
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,650
seems like we're sort of stuck with pie

76
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,650
charts because people like them and this

77
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,390
is a potential problem right because

78
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,840
this thing that we've shown is not a

79
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,870
very good way of portraying information

80
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,360
accurately is what is preferred by most

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,660
people and that is a tension that shows

82
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,910
up a lot in science communication that

83
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,100
the things that people are drawn to are

84
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,570
not necessarily the things and this is

85
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,770
what we want one thing that Christie

86
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,990
mentioned was people might be drawn to

87
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,240
something that's not very helpful for

88
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,820
their understanding and that remains

89
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,630
true in my area of science communication

90
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,700
which is video production this is Derek

91
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,490
Muller who is a host of a very popular

92
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,160
science YouTube channel and he also has

93
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,390
a PhD in science education and he did an

94
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,180
interesting experiment where he showed

95
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,420
students a well first he gave him a

96
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,090
pretest about an area of physics then he

97
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,620
showed them one of two videos and then

98
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,620
they had them take another test and so

99
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,070
on the pretest the students got six out

100
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,630
of 26 answers correct and then half of

101
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,340
them were shown a video I'm gonna call

102
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,919
video one which basically laid out the

103
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:26,550
concept

104
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,440
very clearly very in a very entertaining

105
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,009
way and the students liked it they said

106
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,800
it was interesting they said it was fun

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,349
and they used the word clear a lot it

108
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,300
was very clear and better than that

109
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,830
their confidence about their

110
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,460
understanding of the material was really

111
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,520
increased they said I know this now that

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,349
I've watched this video so then he gave

113
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:51,599
him the second test and they got an

114
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,430
average of six point three correct

115
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,289
answers on this test

116
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:58,289
not exactly the result that you would

117
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,870
want if you're a video creator who's

118
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,539
trying to help people understand science

119
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,949
so then he showed the second group of

120
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,780
students what I'll call video two and

121
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,960
this video started by addressing some of

122
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,879
the major misconceptions that people had

123
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,979
around this area of physics and it sort

124
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,110
of picked those apart it had people

125
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,639
talking about what they believed and

126
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,020
then said well that's not right

127
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,840
and students did not like this video

128
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,000
they found it confusing that was the

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,050
major word they used and their

130
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,819
confidence didn't go up quite as much

131
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,779
about the subject matter but when they

132
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,909
took that test sure you can see where

133
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:42,000
this is going their understanding and

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,159
actually increased a lot more so again

135
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,949
we see this tension between the things

136
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,020
that people would seek out this clear

137
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,940
video that was entertaining that they

138
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,659
enjoyed watching and a video that was

139
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,219
confusing but actually help them

140
00:05:56,219 --> 00:06:00,029
understand the information better so

141
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,169
this is the sort of theme that I'm

142
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,659
building towards clearly when I think

143
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,279
about science communication I think

144
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,849
about the goal of reaching a large

145
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:10,860
audience with accurate information or

146
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,900
you could reverse that and say I want to

147
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,569
bring accurate information to as many

148
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:18,509
people as possible with a little caveat

149
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,849
of you want to make sure that they trust

150
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,949
the information you're giving them and I

151
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,580
think these examples of these videos and

152
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,430
these pie charts sort of show that those

153
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,020
these two parts of this goal are

154
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,259
sometimes in opposition and I talked

155
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,789
about pie charts for a long time but

156
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:38,020
with the remaining time that I have

157
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,220
I'm gonna talk a little bit about how I

158
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,560
try to find a balance between the

159
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,039
different parts of this goal in my work

160
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,970
so as was mentioned I started out at NPR

161
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,500
science desk over there for many years

162
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,449
and I created this YouTube channel

163
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,159
called skunk bear that covered all

164
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,930
different kinds of science topics and

165
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,539
then I moved to a Netflix show called

166
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:01,449
explained which is sort of a topical

167
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,940
documentary show they tackle different

168
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,610
topics like for example the next

169
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,009
pandemic was just happened to be one of

170
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:10,240
the episodes that was published in

171
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,259
November and the top tackle these topics

172
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,750
and try to cover them in about 20

173
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,770
minutes so I made a miniseries I wrote

174
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,449
and directed this miniseries called the

175
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,500
mind explained which covered memory

176
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,780
dreams anxiety mindfulness and

177
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,909
psychedelics and the goal was to sort of

178
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,740
capture the consensus the scientific

179
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,310
consensus around each of these topics

180
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,020
and of course we wanted as many people

181
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,300
as possible to watch it especially

182
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,539
Netflix was very into that idea and so

183
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:46,690
how did we go about finding that large

184
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,509
audience this is a screenshot of one of

185
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:51,430
the episodes and I'll point to a few

186
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,750
different things one is that we got a

187
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,699
Emma Stone to narrate it which never

188
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:55,930
hurts to have a little celebrity

189
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,080
firepower but the thing that I want to

190
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,240
point out specifically and it's kind of

191
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,680
an obvious thing if you want more people

192
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,159
to engage with your science you should

193
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,620
make it accessible to more people and so

194
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,229
you know Netflix translates these things

195
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,590
they have people doing the narration in

196
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,180
different languages and they also have

197
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,430
the subtitles translated into a bunch of

198
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,779
different languages but of course

199
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,240
creating a welcoming product is not just

200
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,849
about what language it's in but it's

201
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,490
about the representation that's behind

202
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,679
the camera and in front of the camera

203
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,020
and that's a real problem in media here

204
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,690
come the pie charts apologies to Edward

205
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,620
Tufte this is some of the people who are

206
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,350
or making media right now and you can

207
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,329
see it's it leans heavily towards the

208
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,760
male and maybe that has something to do

209
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,100
with the fact that

210
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,639
more represented in media and so as I

211
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,050
was starting this project I read a

212
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,120
couple of pieces from some Atlantic

213
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,819
writers about how they were looking at

214
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:06,690
the gender imbalance in their work and

215
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,279
how they tried to address it and I

216
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,440
thought this was pretty interesting

217
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,350
because when I went to look at my work I

218
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,029
saw the same imbalance that was in those

219
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,069
parts before right I thought that I was

220
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:19,079
trying to do a good job of

221
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:21,329
representation but I wasn't and that is

222
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,959
what these writers also discovered and

223
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:28,170
the way that they found out to fight

224
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,550
this problem was basically just to keep

225
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,949
track ed young called it a vaccine

226
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:33,810
against self delusion keeping a

227
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,209
spreadsheet of all his sources and he

228
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,949
also found you know he took a look he

229
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:39,899
gathered a lot of data and he found that

230
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,959
it was just a little bit harder to find

231
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,660
women sources than male sources but it

232
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,310
only added 15 minutes to his work so

233
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,639
this is something that I decided to do

234
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,750
with with this project and for for a

235
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,459
couple reasons of course there's lots of

236
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,040
reasons to have a good balance of

237
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,019
sources in your work and one is just to

238
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,009
fight the sort of current system that we

239
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,750
have where women are pushed away from

240
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,449
science but one is another one is just

241
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:11,189
to increase your audience it's easier to

242
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:13,139
engage with a subject if you can feel

243
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,730
connected to it and I think it's easier

244
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,829
to feel the connected to something if

245
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,089
you can connect with the people who are

246
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:20,880
on screen so that that worked for us

247
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,250
pretty well we managed to get pretty

248
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,160
good balance but if you look at sort of

249
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,630
our experts versus just the characters

250
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,130
talking about their experience it was a

251
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,889
little bit not as good so more work to

252
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:34,649
be done another way that we tried to

253
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,740
meet people where they were is by asking

254
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:45,089
questions that people really had just as

255
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,579
a very first basic questions we tried to

256
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,850
meet the audience where they were and we

257
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,130
tried to engage with those questions not

258
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,439
trying to get too complicated just

259
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:03,040
trying to validate people's confusion

260
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,259
and in the way that Derek Muller talked

261
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,630
about address some of the misconceptions

262
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,829
about those questions right off the bat

263
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:14,380
I just wanted to say a little little

264
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,259
thing about we mentioned the conspiracy

265
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,860
theories around the corona virus and I

266
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,660
think one of the things that explain

267
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,160
we're trying to fight against is is

268
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,420
these conspiracy theories our

269
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,730
competitors in the media are people

270
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,319
peddling these conspiracy theories and

271
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,160
one of the things that they have going

272
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,560
for them is this sort of dramatic

273
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,170
cinematic story that they can tell it's

274
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,750
not true but it's you know this story of

275
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,880
coronavirus being an escaped bioweapon

276
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,970
it feels like something from a 1920s

277
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,850
film and that's pretty compelling but I

278
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,019
think another thing that makes it a very

279
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,509
compelling is the idea that you're

280
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:58,420
letting someone in on a secret truth

281
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,670
like hey come here look behind this

282
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,470
curtain you're gonna be one of the few

283
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,819
people in the world who knows what's

284
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:06,819
really going on and I think that's very

285
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,560
powerful people want to know the truth

286
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,630
people want to know what's really going

287
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,130
on and so explained we kind of try to

288
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,829
use that same energy and excitement

289
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:22,420
because we are gonna actually show them

290
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,800
what's really going on we're gonna pull

291
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,019
the curtain back and show them all these

292
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:28,870
scientists back here working and bring

293
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,170
them along for the ride and and sort of

294
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,329
let them in on this this secret world

295
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,430
that's not really a secret but makes it

296
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,810
try to make it feel special for them so

297
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,899
as we're doing this how do we make sure

298
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,439
that people trust what we're telling

299
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,420
them there's a lot of different

300
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,589
techniques but I'm just gonna highlight

301
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:54,300
one which is showing our work we try to

302
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,660
share as much of our primary sources on

303
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,250
screen these are actual screen shots of

304
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,439
the show we're showing newspaper clips

305
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:07,089
and diagrams and videos from different

306
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:12,069
sources and graphs from published papers

307
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:14,079
and things like that and we really try

308
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,030
to dive into these

309
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,090
and explain them not just throw them up

310
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,920
on screen but say hey look at this look

311
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,960
at this dot this is what this means this

312
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,830
is what these various axes are so

313
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,470
showing our work is a big part of sort

314
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,830
of explains model another advantage to

315
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,740
showing primary sources in this way I

316
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,320
think is it adds a little bit of a human

317
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,700
element it reminds people where this

318
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,890
information comes from so for example if

319
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,920
I wanted to talk about evolution about a

320
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,050
phylogenetic tree the tree of life I

321
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,110
could throw this basic diagram up on the

322
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,860
screen it's very clean and clear I could

323
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,600
also throw something like this up there

324
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,890
it's a little Messier uglier I might not

325
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,190
want to show something like this but if

326
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,110
I reveal that this is a notebook page

327
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,470
from Charles Darwin's work and you can

328
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,270
see up in the corner there he wrote I

329
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,710
think which I've always really loved

330
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,710
this is bringing in reminding people

331
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,050
about the process which I think is is

332
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,730
very helpful to sort of adding some some

333
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,620
trust as saying hey real people were

334
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,330
trying to figure this out and they were

335
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,800
struggling and they were having

336
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,440
hypotheses and that weren't quite right

337
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,870
and and that's how we got to this

338
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,740
information that we're sharing right now

339
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,260
finally you know one of the best ways to

340
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,610
make people trust your work is to be

341
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,570
consistently accurate and there are a

342
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,280
multitude of ways that of course

343
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,160
journalists try to achieve this and I

344
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,110
won't slog through them all but I just

345
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,600
want to mention one thing which is

346
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,110
coming back to those questions that that

347
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,670
sort of frame our episodes we tried to

348
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,700
stay very true to the questions that we

349
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,700
came up with before we did much much

350
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,820
research we didn't want to frame these

351
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,070
episodes around a specific answer and

352
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,770
sort of try to prove a thesis but rather

353
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,930
to follow the question wherever it led

354
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,139
and I think that a lot of the

355
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,490
science and health documentaries

356
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,139
quote-unquote that you see on Netflix

357
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:36,379
are very much they have something they

358
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:37,699
want to say and they sort of build

359
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,869
backwards from that they try to to prove

360
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:45,910
some sort of point our goal was to

361
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,230
highlight the journey towards this

362
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,910
information start with a question and

363
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,980
then invite the audience along to see

364
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,790
where it took us so yeah that's that's

365
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,350
all I have for you today thank you for

366
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,749
having me and hope to talk to you more

367
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,840
at the coffee break

368
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,210
