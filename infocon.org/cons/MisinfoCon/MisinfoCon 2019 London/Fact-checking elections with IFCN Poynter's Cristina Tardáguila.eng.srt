1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,770
so oh my name is crystal viola and my

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,210
last thing is really hard to say thank

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,200
you for getting that right I'm the

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,460
Associate Director at the international

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,679
fact-checking Network and I kind of I'm

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,869
gonna spend like a really short time

7
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:19,149
trying to explain what the IFC na is

8
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:21,250
because I might you might not know what

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,860
what it does and I'm sorry for my

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,410
English and Brazilian so I will spend

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,930
more time than 10 minutes Andrea just

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,579
said it's okay so well this is way worse

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,989
and this is me we are running the

14
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,020
fact-checking Network since May and

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,760
we're trying to spread the word around

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,020
we're trying to get fact checkers

17
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,790
together and to work together as a team

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,590
because we really need to collaborate

19
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,750
with each other because we have so many

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,180
different people trying to fight

21
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,340
misinformation around and there's so

22
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,970
many levels of development in that field

23
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,070
that we need to share knowledge and we

24
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,840
need to work together to strengthen the

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,470
field this is what we do in a daily

26
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,909
basis we are more than 180 fact-checking

27
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:08,170
units around the world actually

28
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,050
yesterday the Duke reporters lab just

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,000
came up to their senses just went up to

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,220
210 platforms around the world which is

31
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,560
amazing when I started fact-checking

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,159
back in 2014 we were only 40 so it means

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,040
like in five years this is how big the

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,070
movement is growing we do buy at the IFC

35
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,320
and we trend everything that is going

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,270
around the universe of misinformation

37
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,840
and this information and we try to

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,400
approach governments and platforms and

39
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,670
and to work together and see how we can

40
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,450
help either platforms and tech companies

41
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,909
and fact-checking units to make their

42
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,880
work better right we advocate for that

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,280
and we protect fact checkers because you

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,900
might you need to believe that I have

45
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,729
just changed my entire life because in

46
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,430
2018 I was threatened to death in Brazil

47
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,689
either by Lula's supporters and by votes

48
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,280
and other supporters because in Brazil

49
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,810
right now you just it's really hard to

50
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,508
be a fact checker and as as it is in in

51
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,209
Turkey as it is in in many other parts

52
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:14,889
in Venezuela as it is in many other

53
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,730
countries so we

54
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,099
to protect what is being done we have a

55
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,959
code of principles we believe that

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,879
fact-checking is a really powerful tool

57
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,220
and there are so many people wanting to

58
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,319
become fact checkers but fact-checking

59
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,230
needs to be done in the right way right

60
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,090
you need to have you need to be

61
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,430
transparent you need to be to have a

62
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,700
public correction policy and you need to

63
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,410
apply it whenever you have something

64
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,239
wrong and you need to be clear about

65
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,579
your funders you need to be you need to

66
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,620
follow a little bit of ethics when

67
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,090
you're trying to tell the truth and

68
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,150
we're trying to teach that worldwide so

69
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,310
that's why we also do workshops and we

70
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,670
also do offer a global fact which is our

71
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,700
largest it is the largest summit in fact

72
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,650
checking the next one will be in Oslo

73
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,319
June next year so you're all invited to

74
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:09,079
join us and we also keep a huge amount

75
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:11,480
of information being published every day

76
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,849
we have the if' sans website is hosted

77
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:16,670
at the pointers website and we do have a

78
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,799
weekly newsletter it's called factually

79
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,019
I really appreciate if you follow that

80
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:23,150
too and we also celebrate the

81
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,380
international fact-checking day I don't

82
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,900
know if it's in the UK you have the full

83
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,720
day neighbor first and but we do in

84
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,370
Kampala the word so we decided that

85
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,919
since April 1st is Fool's Day

86
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,510
fact-checking day would be April 2nd so

87
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,669
here's what I said when when I started

88
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:43,790
fact-checking back in 2014 we were 40

89
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,130
platforms in 20 countries and this was

90
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,430
in Cape Town our glass global fact and

91
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,010
these guys in the back were all there

92
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,349
the globe lead lead stories and Paciello

93
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,870
politic and also a little below and this

94
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,250
is the team we're growing you we're not

95
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,470
gonna stop we're not gonna stop our work

96
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,139
right we have so many challenges ahead

97
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,090
but we're going to keep fact-checking we

98
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,829
keep saying that the the fact-checking

99
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,660
community keeps growing because the the

100
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,669
misinformation probably problem keeps

101
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:14,690
growing too so we just keep working but

102
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,089
the I have seen since we're all trying

103
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,910
to find a solution for this information

104
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,490
and misinformation problem we're trying

105
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,520
to make the IFC and a group that is not

106
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
a us-based it's a heterogeneous group

107
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,420
right we need

108
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,680
different people thinking about the

109
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,780
problem so this is how the F scene is

110
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,610
composed there is a Turkish director a

111
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,940
Brazilian co-director and there's an

112
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,190
advisory board made out of Americans

113
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,350
Argentinians South Africans Indian

114
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,110
Spanish and I mean born how does that

115
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,970
say in English from Bosnia is a good

116
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,800
wine how or the person who was born

117
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,420
there

118
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,610
okay that's it so and we have different

119
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,590
interests in that group some people only

120
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,280
do two bunks I mean they only deal with

121
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,480
hoaxes there are spread online and you

122
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,640
don't know who was the first one who

123
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,590
posted it and there are some others that

124
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,970
are only doing fact-checking

125
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,220
like political the ones that you

126
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,980
probably know who said the world or who

127
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,560
said the claim so and their different

128
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,090
goals also there are those fact-checking

129
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,010
platforms that are only dealing with

130
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,330
politics there are those are only

131
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,760
dealing with health issues those that

132
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,010
are dealing with climate changes

133
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,290
questions right and and and there's so

134
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,470
many levels of access of public data I

135
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,510
mean I was just talking to full facts

136
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,700
yesterday here in the UK and we were

137
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,340
just comparing how easy it is to reach

138
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,050
data here in the UK and how hard it is

139
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,970
to reach data in Brazil and I was just

140
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,380
laughing at myself I'm like oh my god I

141
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,300
wish I had that in Rio de Janerio but

142
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,800
wait we don't so and I'm trying to show

143
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,080
you how different misinformation is

144
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,030
around the world so we when we think

145
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,500
about the solution we have to think

146
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,200
broad as one solution is not gonna solve

147
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,750
the entire problem this is the state of

148
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,180
fact-checkers this is a kind of senses

149
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,060
that the the IFC and does this how we

150
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,420
look like right now in 2018 we are

151
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,600
mainly a non-profit world right and now

152
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,020
we're turning into a profitable world

153
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,940
the fact-checking community is getting

154
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,880
money which is unbelievable right

155
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,060
journalism make me money yeah we kind of

156
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,360
but not not a lot that's why I asked

157
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,760
about the ads in the previous

158
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,000
conversation we really need more we are

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,630
more people we have more effort we more

160
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,570
work to be done we're more platforms but

161
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,570
we are not getting that much money so we

162
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,590
still need to work on that

163
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,310
and right that um Connie and Antonia

164
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,650
they asked me how different is

165
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,190
misinformation around so I'm trying to I

166
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,710
selected a few examples of platforms

167
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,810
that are in the IFC and world to show

168
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,510
you how different it is so once we talk

169
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,000
about solutions we think of them here's

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,280
 Amman and I don't even know how

171
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,960
to pronounce that correctly it there

172
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,470
they're working on the I on Iran but

173
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,910
they're not in Iran right the guy lives

174
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,800
in Toronto because he just can't live in

175
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,230
Tehran he has a fatwa does that say

176
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,640
there's the word in English for that

177
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,280
okay he can't be he changed his name he

178
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,570
can't be in the photos that's why he's

179
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,490
not in the photo of any global fact he's

180
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,310
the one taking the pictures always and

181
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,690
he uses telegram because he thinks this

182
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,750
besides being the most used platform in

183
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,660
in in Iran this is the supposedly the

184
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,400
most secure system to talk in Iran right

185
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,850
and there's very low access to public

186
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,950
data in Iran so can you imagine that

187
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,170
being a fact checker in the with the

188
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,230
notion of distance and having a father

189
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,280
against you and your family that's

190
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,100
pretty hard so this is Congo check in

191
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,290
Africa right they have all the issues

192
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,860
with health the health system is

193
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,860
cracking under their tenth Ebola crisis

194
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,590
in 40 years they had thousands of deaths

195
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,020
and the problem there is that it's

196
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,200
really really expensive to even get an

197
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,960
internet connection they the ones that

198
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,810
really get a phone with internet they

199
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,480
are the truth tellers and guess where

200
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,340
they go online when they have the

201
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,650
opportunity they go on Facebook and what

202
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,450
is whatever is on Facebook is the truth

203
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,230
so what Congo check does is a fact check

204
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,690
and they deliver the information offline

205
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,270
they handle papers they print out stuff

206
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,179
and they go mouth they talk mouth my

207
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,490
mouth and then Daniella Mendoza and

208
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,130
verificar dough teeming Mexico they're

209
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,190
having the toughest time ever because up

210
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,650
lop is Manuel Lopez Obrador with the

211
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,390
Mexican president just created a

212
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,550
fact-checking unit from the government

213
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,160
which has the same name but if you

214
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,649
hello I mean maybe fika which is kind of

215
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,350
crazy the guy kind of stole the brand

216
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,019
from from the fact checkers yeah two

217
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,079
minutes not gonna work

218
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,000
then there's great Africa check on the

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,490
other side now let's let's kind of show

220
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,870
like the big ones Africa check is fact

221
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,689
checking in to big languages in local

222
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,680
languages too

223
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,449
I just heard boom saying yeah we have

224
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:21,209
this regional problem yes Africa check

225
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,959
does too and there wow they're kind of

226
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,819
managing to work that out right they

227
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:29,370
covered Kenya Nigeria and South Africa

228
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,949
and they just created this wonderful

229
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:35,759
they call it app cast it's a voice note

230
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,610
show five minutes long and they did bunk

231
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,459
information and they only spread that on

232
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,610
whatsapp it's like just for this to your

233
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,610
family friends group right and and then

234
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,970
it's a five minutes very not heavy a kyv

235
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,399
and then people can hear the latest

236
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,500
about what is right and what is wrong

237
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,750
and internet and they of obviously as

238
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,160
everything in Africa they deal with

239
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,589
health issues - and the nearest few fact

240
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:04,829
here in the UK they're I mean they're 22

241
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:08,399
people they're big and they have Lourdes

242
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,939
in their advisory board I mean really

243
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:13,800
it's just amazing right and they're they

244
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,540
have so many so many people working

245
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,000
automation they're really capable of

246
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,100
getting whatever is being said in the

247
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,410
house on the house of in the parliament

248
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,500
and then automatic automatically getting

249
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,040
that onto the paper like speech-to-text

250
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,079
machines and you you don't waste that

251
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:33,269
time so misinformation for them is

252
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,750
something else right they have it's

253
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,089
funny because when we talk about the

254
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,889
topics while while in Africa health here

255
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,870
you're worried about migration you

256
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,699
probably worry about economics a brexit

257
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:50,730
story right and then you have in other

258
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,980
situations so what do we have in common

259
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,079
and I really really want to struggle

260
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,059
that again it's the code of principles

261
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,519
it's something that it's very much

262
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,970
needed in case I don't know if a monster

263
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,660
some new platforms trying to exist or

264
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,320
trying to be born soon but please if

265
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,530
you're trying to create a fact-checking

266
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,510
unit don't forget that you need to be

267
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,490
committed to non-partisanship and

268
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,600
fairness I know it's hard but please

269
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,000
develop a methodology and to be no

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,370
Hardison and fair you need to be

271
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,140
transparent of transparent about your

272
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,410
sources so fact checkers I mean I always

273
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,020
get that that question I probably all

274
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,430
fact-checkers in the back get get that

275
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,260
question to who fact check the fact

276
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,930
checkers and the answer is easy as you I

277
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,540
mean you just have to give people the

278
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,540
opportunity to click in every link and

279
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,300
review your factor so be transparent

280
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,070
about your sources the same thing for

281
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,410
funding in organization just reveal

282
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,290
where your money comes from it can't be

283
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,690
that hard right because if the

284
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,570
journalist needs to be the

285
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,100
accountability in journalism needs to

286
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,020
shift and then transparency of

287
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,390
methodology why your fact-checking this

288
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,880
and not that just tell people that

289
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,730
that's not no no big deal you just have

290
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,730
to do an agreement with your reader just

291
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,160
explain why you do local news and not

292
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,380
international news just tell them in

293
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,170
advance and and then be honest and

294
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,660
correct whenever you are wrong because

295
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,000
you will be wrong fact checkers are

296
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,550
allowed to commit mistakes yeah and

297
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,260
that's it thank you very much I'm sorry

298
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,130
Andrea

299
