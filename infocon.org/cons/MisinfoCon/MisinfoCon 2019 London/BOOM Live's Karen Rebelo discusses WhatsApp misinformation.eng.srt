1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,600
on May 23rd Prime Minister Narendra Modi

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,870
won a second term in in India he won

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,550
with the lands he won a landslide

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,189
victory winning three zero three seats

5
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:21,180
out of 543 you know his party bettered

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,829
their previous record that they saw in

7
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,099
2014 in case you think I made this

8
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,649
fanboy image I did not his party did so

9
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,200
the challenger to him was Rahul Gandhi

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,239
from the Congress party the party was

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,370
completely decimated in the current

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,950
elections India currently has an

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,870
opposition only on paper

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,600
his party won just 52 seats in this

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,870
election after the election raga and the

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,580
in fact stepped down as Congress party

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,390
president so this is what the map of

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,360
India currently looks like with the BJP

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,840
you know sweeping the Safran all around

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,470
very few opposition states currently for

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,060
those of you not familiar with the BJP

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,280
or the Bharatiya janta party as they're

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,380
known they have transformed themselves

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,340
into an election winning machine and you

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,990
know they're a Hindu nationalist party

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,899
they have a very strong clear on ground

27
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:21,659
and offline campaign they're also

28
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,079
India's richest political party and

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,109
early adopters in fact before Trump they

30
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:29,999
were the first ones to realize the power

31
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,530
of social media and they came to power

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,149
in 2014 leveraging that they're also

33
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:38,520
very very good with granule granular

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,789
data so this was a story reported by

35
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,799
Hindustan Times in September last year

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,649
which said that the BJP actually has an

37
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,529
action plan for every polling booth in

38
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:52,319
India there are about 900,000 polling

39
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,389
booths in India so what they plan to do

40
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:55,619
was have a cell phone

41
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,469
pramook or like a cell phone chief that

42
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,179
would create whatsapp groups and

43
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:02,999
distribute their material that could be

44
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,729
you know videos images text graphics

45
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,330
memes through these whatsapp groups so

46
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,010
one of the things I found very similar

47
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,110
to the elections in India was the

48
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,920
parallel that it had

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,680
with the elections in Brazil which is

50
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,069
that you know if you saw depolarization

51
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,459
use we saw messaging apps rife with

52
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:29,620
misinformation and the last two points

53
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,200
are very important far-right campaigns

54
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,989
actually benefit and know how to

55
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,900
leverage when [ __ ] hits the fan it's

56
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,340
it's it's a fact

57
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,270
and lastly misinformation during that

58
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,239
time period is usually used to hijack

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,500
the narrative so two events that shaped

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,660
you know how this election played out

61
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,780
happened in about February one was a

62
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,390
terror attack a suicide bomber on

63
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,760
February 14 drove into a convoy of

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,670
paramilitary soldiers killing over 40

65
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,069
soldiers he won it was one of the worst

66
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,769
attacks that we saw in Kashmir the

67
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,269
country was wounded there was a

68
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,970
sentiment of hot and wanting revenge

69
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,790
soon after the suicide bomber released a

70
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,600
video his image was cropped from that

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,180
video and photoshopped onto a picture

72
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,940
which which showed the Congress party

73
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,720
president this is the original photo and

74
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,910
after this event on February 14th we saw

75
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,730
an onslaught like an avalanche of

76
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,600
misinformation that fell through we saw

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,269
videos and photos from Syria Iraq being

78
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,489
shared as India we saw a mock drill

79
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:53,650
saying this is the Indian Army we saw

80
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,320
images of soldiers and militants killed

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,310
passed off as recent the scale of

82
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,069
misinformation was so great that the

83
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,140
part paramilitary force that was

84
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,720
targeted in this attack launched their

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,120
own internal fact-checking mechanism in

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,100
fact when we spoke to them they said

87
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,989
instead of grieving we were looking for

88
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:19,120
fake post the second event that sort of

89
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,728
shaped this election was a retaliatory

90
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,850
airstrike by India so many two weeks

91
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,909
after the terror attack on February 14th

92
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:30,820
on February 26 the Indian Air Force one

93
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,370
morning

94
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,229
came out and said we've launched an

95
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:35,840
airstrike on what we believe is a terror

96
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
training camp across the line of control

97
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,870
essentially what India had done was you

98
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,090
know this could be seen as triggering is

99
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,619
an act of war

100
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:52,100
soon after this video went viral on

101
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,010
social media

102
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,010
oops

103
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,980
okay if that video looked a bit

104
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,920
ridiculous because it is it's it's from

105
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,200
a video game but that video went around

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,510
it was super viral saying this is

107
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,590
footage of the Indian Air Force

108
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,350
destroying the terror campaign in

109
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,310
Pakistan

110
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,050
till date there has been no footage

111
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,550
released by the Air Force so amidst all

112
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,530
that madness just the very next day

113
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,900
after that air strike Pakistan tried to

114
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,420
retaliate it sent across some planes to

115
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,190
attack military installations

116
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,290
it was fended off by the Indian Air

117
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,080
Force during that process we lost one of

118
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,450
our pilots who was captured alive by

119
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,360
Pakistan eventually both countries at

120
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,480
this point of time were at a standoff

121
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,680
you know all of us had forgotten that

122
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,510
there was an election just two months

123
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,100
away we were thinking okay we're going

124
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,340
to war but thankfully better sense

125
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,980
prevailed and Pakistan did eventually

126
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,080
hand back that pilot soon afterwards

127
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,760
there was this picture which said oh

128
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,500
look the pilot that was captured by

129
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,200
Pakistan has now come out and voted for

130
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,270
the BJP but that happened to be a

131
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,550
doppelganger and this is the actual

132
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,980
pilot if by now you're thinking this is

133
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,660
like a really bad Bollywood movie I

134
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,270
don't blame you so so I mean yeah it was

135
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,410
no understatement to say that

136
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,180
misinformation was rife during this

137
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,940
period one key theme of misinformation

138
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,630
was nationalism these are some

139
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,860
statistics that we pulled together

140
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,290
quickly counting the unique messages or

141
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,690
queries that we received on our whatsapp

142
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,520
helpline number so we have a helpline

143
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,230
number where we ask people to forward as

144
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,960
messages and then we verify them during

145
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,000
the months of voting in April you see a

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,190
spike and that continues into May the

147
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,500
other theme that we saw apart from

148
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,260
nationalism was communal polarization so

149
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,570
there's a lot of Hindu Muslim community

150
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,220
or Lehrer ization that's current even

151
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,560
right now ongoing in India often you

152
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,770
have you know videos from Bangladesh

153
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,420
trying to project Muslims as as a

154
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,990
violent not being shared with the

155
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,930
context that it's happening in India

156
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,039
there was also

157
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,830
a video of Rahl Gandhi visiting a dagger

158
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,289
or a mosque where he is wearing a white

159
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,930
skullcap it's not really on this video

160
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,780
but you know the the caption claimed

161
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,139
that he is secretly a Muslim therefore

162
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,750
you know 80% of the Hindu population of

163
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,250
India should not vote for his party so

164
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,139
it wasn't only the BJP doing it the

165
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:04,110
other side was doing it as well

166
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,060
divya spandana was the Congress party is

167
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,710
okay I have two minutes for Congress

168
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,349
party is social media head through this

169
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:12,940
picture she tried to make a comparison

170
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,949
with Hitler if you see the original

171
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,440
photo he's been photoshopped here's

172
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,060
another one where you show the Pakistani

173
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,289
flag this one clay Modi hired a makeup

174
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,360
artist but if you zoom in you can

175
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,130
clearly see that they were you know

176
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,520
taking measurements yeah we also saw a

177
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,549
lot of voter fraud post related to water

178
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,529
fraud and fake surveys such as this some

179
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:40,419
day this is about electronic voting

180
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,929
machines this one claims you can ask for

181
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,550
a challenge what if a name is not on the

182
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,520
water list and this is my favorite it's

183
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,339
actually prosthetic fingers made for the

184
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,230
Japanese Yakuza but we also came across

185
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,510
an instance of a fake politician that

186
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,399
was created where we saw a number of

187
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,670
videos that claimed this is politician

188
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,820
Anna Lou Padilla from BJP and some other

189
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,770
post which claimed he he belonged to the

190
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,720
Congress party and we did a deep dive

191
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,970
and found out nobody by that name exists

192
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,899
so finally I'll just end with this some

193
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,779
of the themes that we saw I went through

194
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,990
nationalism in the Muslim polarization

195
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,050
integrity of electronic voting machines

196
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,940
misinformation was mostly visual and

197
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,520
visceral you know images videos memes

198
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,740
we did not have that many data claims to

199
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,950
fact check messages triggering outrage

200
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,940
went viral more quickly and finally the

201
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,310
left also did it but it did not gain as

202
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,110
much traction I'm going on time okay

203
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,400
then we have more slides

204
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
okay this is this is all right this is

205
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,250
the last one so why is what's up such a

206
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,200
big vector of misinformation in India

207
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,110
it's because it has 400 million what we

208
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,240
have 400 million whatsapp users that's

209
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,550
practically about the same size of the

210
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,000
population more or less that's online

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,650
cheap data plans and have enabled a lot

212
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,390
of people to come online many of these

213
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,800
people who've come online for the first

214
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,290
time they don't know how to tell fact

215
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,120
from false news and finally

216
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,130
misinformation thrives in regional

217
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,410
languages away from the scrutiny of fact

218
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,510
checkers which mostly operate in English

219
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,130
in Hindi alright my time's up

220
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,929
