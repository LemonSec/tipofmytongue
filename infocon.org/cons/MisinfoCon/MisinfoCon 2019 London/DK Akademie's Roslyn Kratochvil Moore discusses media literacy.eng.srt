00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:05,639
Thank You Andrea I work for Deutsche

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,340
Welle Academy and Deutsche Welle Academy

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,969
is the media development wing of

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,440
Deutsche Welle which is the German

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,959
public broadcaster for those of you that

6
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:20,360
don't know anything about DW Academy and

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,980
we've been working in media development

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,940
for over 50 years but it's always

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,610
traditionally in journalism education

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,549
and journalism training and it's only in

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,589
the last 10 years that we've moved into

12
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:37,230
looking at the media as a whole kind of

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,780
ecosystem something we heard earlier and

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,980
looking at media viability and business

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,780
models for sustainable media and also

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,559
looking at journalism education digital

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,210
rights and media and information

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,159
literacy and today I'm going to talk

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,749
about our median Information literacy

20
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:02,999
work so we understand that median

21
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:04,500
information literacy is about enabling

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,560
people to understand and use media and

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,899
so from the media development component

24
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,729
were really interested in reaching the

25
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,619
consumers and working with who's

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,250
consuming the information and the news

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,270
that we're sharing and so in 2013 we

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,799
started to think about how do we work

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,759
with media information literacy what do

30
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,329
we understand it to be and we aligned

31
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,820
ourselves with UNESCO who were at the

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,280
same time developing their media and

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,430
information literacy working growing in

34
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,570
in promoting it we're very much aligned

35
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,320
to human rights principles and we are

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,240
the kind of underlining pillar of all of

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,729
our work is article 19 which is about

38
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,530
freedom of expression and access to

39
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,799
information and so under this we came up

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,390
with looking at what are the skills that

41
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,490
are needed of an individual in order to

42
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,399
be able to understand and use media and

43
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,160
so we have a set of five competencies

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,000
the citizens need the consumers needs in

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,660
order to be able to do this and so these

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,240
are to create so it was produced and

47
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,300
share your message you were to access it

48
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,520
so we have to find and use the

49
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,610
information feel to analyze it so to

50
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,200
understand and assess the media

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,280
ecosystem to be able to recognize what

52
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,470
misinformation hate speech cyberbullying

53
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,450
to then think themselves and reflect on

54
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,340
all of this and to say well what are my

55
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,770
rights and where my obligations and then

56
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,940
for them to act and right now we see a

57
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,970
lot of focus really on that act that we

58
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,120
want consumers to act in terms of media

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,560
and information literacy we keep saying

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,820
oh we need media and information

61
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,180
literacy as the kind of remedy to all of

62
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,500
the problems that we're seeing right now

63
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,810
in the world and I quite often hear this

64
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,310
being bandied about it not just

65
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,410
internally in Deutsche Welle Academy we

66
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,570
all kind of have these conversations is

67
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,780
median information literacy the answer

68
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,990
to radicalization is a kind of solve

69
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,080
youth violence and Latin America can it

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,820
be what's the role of media and

71
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,500
information literacy and all of these

72
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,930
social problems that we're seeing today

73
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,670
and this is something extremely

74
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,240
complicated complex because the media

75
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,740
has a role in all of these things as

76
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,170
well and the information and what been

77
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,620
heard the last two sessions about how

78
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,140
information is spread and misinformation

79
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,750
and all of these things are affecting

80
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,750
all of these bigger societal problems

81
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,430
and so at the moment in Deutsche Welle

82
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,530
we work on media information literacy in

83
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,590
21 countries across 22 21 projects

84
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,510
across 22 countries in the world we work

85
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,529
across Africa Asia Latin America North

86
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,240
Africa Middle East and Eastern Europe we

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,250
don't work within the EU

88
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,740
because we're a development organization

89
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,770
that's funded from taxpayers money and

90
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,920
so all of our work has to be outside of

91
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:40,160
the West so North America as well and we

92
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,460
have these five competencies that we

93
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,340
consider to be your median information

94
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,790
literacy the fight together make you

95
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:56,240
able to kind of responsibly and empower

96
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,210
you to be able to engage in our media

97
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,310
environments but they're not all equal

98
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,990
and so for us create has always been the

99
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,240
kind of hook to reach people and in the

100
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,980
beginning this was how we started our

101
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,050
projects so in the beginning we started

102
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,040
in 2013 with a project in Namibia and a

103
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,590
project in Cambodia and it was all

104
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,350
around youth and it was around training

105
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,110
young people as multipliers to go out

106
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,580
into their community to then run more

107
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,750
trainings and workshops and summer

108
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,210
skills on media and information literacy

109
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,690
and we created huge networks of you know

110
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,900
kind of what we call in Namibia the

111
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,419
media and information literacy

112
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,890
initiative family and people wants to be

113
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,570
part of this family and you created a

114
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,070
momentum around media information

115
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,000
literacy in the country and this was

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,250
very successful but we quickly realized

117
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,710
that people are excited will to create

118
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,630
and then with create you then embed all

119
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,330
of the other access analyse reflect and

120
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,200
act skills into into the project but

121
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,580
what we realized quite quickly was that

122
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,080
this is a drop in the ocean

123
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,760
you can only so we trained up these

124
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,669
multipliers in summer skills or in

125
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,500
diploma courses we have different levels

126
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,560
of what you can and get to in terms of

127
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,130
training but ultimately you're not this

128
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,780
is a math problem and these critical

129
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,890
mass and this is the easiest and fastest

130
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,200
way to start what we need to think a bit

131
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,320
broader and so at this point we said

132
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,600
okay we need to really be getting into

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,130
the classroom leave you're talking to

134
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,289
the Ministry of Education we need to be

135
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,620
getting media facial literacy into

136
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,970
curriculums and this is something that

137
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,520
UNESCO is very very big on since the

138
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,100
beginning and they've done a lot on

139
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,639
curriculums for teachers and so we came

140
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,620
on board but how do we facilitate this

141
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,740
how do we use our local partners because

142
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,780
we work through partners and all the

143
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,120
countries we work in how do we you know

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,270
move together to create a Lobby and the

145
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,860
momentum for getting media information

146
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,300
literacy into into the education system

147
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,669
now this is a long haul thing because if

148
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,979
any of you have ever tried anything with

149
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,680
ministries of Education they're not

150
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,630
changing their curriculum very fast and

151
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,780
yeah it's the long-term goal so it's

152
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,490
just one approach which has been

153
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:27,639
successful in Palestine in Cambodia in

154
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,400
Hmong in Moldova we've managed to get

155
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,130
into the curriculum and then you have

156
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,600
the big problem of okay we have to Train

157
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,860
all the teachers we have to get it into

158
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,530
the teacher training vocational colleges

159
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,240
we have to get it in and so it's a very

160
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,970
big movement that an organization like

161
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,240
Deutsche Welle which is very small and

162
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,340
yet in reality to this can't do alone

163
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,139
and so we are now working very much in

164
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,880
partnerships and collaborations to see

165
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,419
how do we move to this next step of

166
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,740
critical mass in we talked earlier I

167
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,030
heard girls talking I think it was from

168
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,530
pointers about the fact that we have

169
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,970
very different problems and different

170
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,010
with this information depending on the

171
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,260
region depending on the country and so

172
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,760
it's the same with median information

173
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,690
literacy of course and although we

174
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,910
traditionally in the beginning started

175
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,150
with youth because they're the majority

176
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,500
of the population and most of the

177
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,410
countries we work in and also easy to

178
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,900
reach and all creating things already on

179
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,729
their phones or whatever so interested

180
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:33,400
to join in on a median information

181
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,130
literacy course we then quickly realized

182
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,830
okay but young journalists also need

183
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:44,440
these skills and so do adults women

184
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,839
anybody that's engaging and wants to be

185
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,150
active in terms of the media environment

186
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,680
in terms of sharing information

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,550
and so in Georgia where we have a big

188
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,649
project working with young students the

189
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,899
focus is on fact-checking when

190
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,459
fact-checking for us would come under

191
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,040
the kind of competency of analyze and so

192
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,119
analyzes the is the kind of umbrella or

193
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:10,129
the the big balloon that pulls the

194
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,929
project up and then all of these other

195
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,999
companies are brought into the project

196
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,819
and under a fact-checking initiative

197
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:21,230
called myth detector lab in Georgia

198
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,470
which is looking at propaganda coming

199
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,629
from Russia propaganda coming from the

200
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:28,819
west and fact checking all of it to see

201
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,019
what does it actually mean for Russia

202
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,220
which has a big problem with his

203
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,980
information words then we move over to

204
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,019
Guatemala where we work with a radio

205
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,689
station an originally radio station was

206
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:43,040
a youth radio station I thought okay

207
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,160
we'll just go into schools and we will

208
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,800
run kind of fun from the satellite where

209
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,809
the camps where their children can your

210
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,720
youth can make their own shows and can

211
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,970
broadcast them and then leave you guys

212
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,829
quickly that they wanted to actually

213
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:04,100
move this and develop it further into a

214
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,860
milk project looking at all of the areas

215
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,709
of mill and as they did that they

216
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,329
realized well actually we can develop

217
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:17,089
the mill alright times up mill for we

218
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,629
can develop mill for and for the radio

219
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,160
so that we can actually reach all the

220
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,569
indigenous groups we have indigenous

221
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:24,860
language radios from individuals all

222
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,639
over the country

223
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,920
and then finally the one last project

224
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,509
that we have which is then looking at

225
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,429
how to collaborate with a bigger picture

226
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,110
which is with the media houses

227
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,519
themselves which we have the reach to

228
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,189
because we work with local media's we

229
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:38,870
work with building up the media systems

230
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,549
and the countries we work in is in

231
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,709
Mongolia where we are now working on a

232
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,249
fact-checking project with Deutsche

233
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:49,040
Welle have their own truly media

234
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,579
collaborative verification program they

235
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:55,790
have deep digger digger project looking

236
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,769
at deep fakes and audio forensics and

237
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,089
working with the media Council in

238
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,829
Mongolia so the journalists are all

239
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,470
collaborating

240
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,990
using these material for the media

241
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,610
system and then also working with the

242
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,440
teachers and with the civil society to

243
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,230
bring know from both sites so very very

244
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,510
quickly to answer my last question Tom

245
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,580
mill defeat misinformation it's very

246
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,870
much repetition of what we've already

247
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,260
heard which is that we need the

248
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,420
platforms we need governments we need

249
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,240
the media themselves as well as civil

250
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,810
society organizations and educators they

251
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,589
cannot do it alone
