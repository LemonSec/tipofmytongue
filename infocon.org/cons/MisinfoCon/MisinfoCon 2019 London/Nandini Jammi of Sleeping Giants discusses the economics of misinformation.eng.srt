00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,060
hi everyone I'm Deanie I am a co-founder

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,670
of sleeping giants who here has heard of

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:18,869
sleeping giants that's so exciting so

4
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,519
for those of you who don't know what

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,890
sleeping giants is let me tell you about

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,560
it so here's my story back in November

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,170
2016 I can see the screen from here so I

8
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,640
don't have to do that so back in

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,670
November 2016 I went on Breitbart comm

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,160
for the first time shortly after the

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,719
elections I'd never been on this website

12
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,120
before but I'd been hearing about it I

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,410
knew they were putting putting out a lot

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,120
of misinformation and propaganda online

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,059
and I thought I would see for myself

16
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:48,489
so what shocked me wasn't the headlines

17
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:51,100
that I saw on this website I I knew what

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,289
to expect but what did shocked me was

19
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:56,590
seeing ads for companies that I buy from

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,660
that I shop with so I saw I think the

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,190
first ad that I saw was for like Old

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,730
Navy there was target t-mobile just you

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,349
know and I instantly put on my marketing

24
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,409
hat you know I was you know I'm a tech

25
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,369
market or this is what I've been doing

26
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,200
for years and the first thing I thought

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,090
was you know these guys like don't know

28
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,009
they're on this website they have no

29
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,030
idea they've turned on their

30
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,380
programmatic ads they've turned on their

31
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,140
Google and their Facebook ads and they

32
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,880
are just appearing anywhere on the

33
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,720
Internet so luckily I found a partner in

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,820
this someone else had also noticed the

35
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,220
same thing we did we started to tweet at

36
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,320
companies under this handle sleeping

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,570
giants we were anonymous during this

38
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,850
time and we just did what we would do it

39
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,220
just send out we take a screenshot of an

40
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,920
ad and tweeted at the company and let

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,979
him know you know you know hey your ads

42
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,479
are on this racist website are you sure

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,540
you want to be here and what was

44
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,040
interesting was that businesses and

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,450
brands wrote is right back very quickly

46
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,240
saying nope we had no idea thanks so

47
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,130
much for letting us know we'll be sure

48
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,420
to add it to our blacklist and you know

49
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,130
this how this started happening enough

50
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,250
that we turned it into a list we made a

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,320
public Google spreadsheet basically like

52
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,850
the confirmed list of all the brands

53
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,490
that had taken Breitbart off of there

54
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:12,930
there

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,090
over typing and to be honest with you we

56
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,980
expected this to be like a two-week

57
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,930
project you know we're like we can we

58
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,540
found this problem in advertising now

59
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,890
you go fix it

60
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,659
that's not how it ended up working out

61
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:28,950
for us we're still in business

62
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,780
unfortunately nonprofit very nonprofit

63
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,299
so so people started to take notice they

64
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,099
wanted to join us in doing this and

65
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,019
obviously anyone can get involved in a

66
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,569
project like this so we said sure just

67
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,569
you know take screenshots with us Todd

68
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,489
how do the companies and tag us in it so

69
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,549
we can keep track of it please be polite

70
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,700
and you know like I'll be honest with

71
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,579
you like I am the most shocked that this

72
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,709
could have ever worked like this was

73
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,530
such a crazy weird idea but I found out

74
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,030
earlier or we found out earlier this

75
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,639
summer when the Steve Bannon video

76
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,799
leaked this video Steve Bannon talking

77
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,010
to his Nazi pals here in London actually

78
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,909
you know they're talking about how you

79
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,139
know like money stuff they're talking

80
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,900
shop and they're like yeah we we lost 90

81
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,250
percent of our revenues within the first

82
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,889
three months 20 odd networks dropped us

83
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,019
and it was a direct result of our our

84
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,419
work or collective effort and so as of

85
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,669
today we have over 4,200 advertisers

86
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,030
that have that have publicly confirmed

87
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,379
that they've dropped right Bart but that

88
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,780
number is much higher if you count the

89
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,169
people who haven't told us so as I

90
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,250
mentioned we were working on this

91
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,189
anonymously up until last summer when my

92
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:46,319
partner Matt was doxed by the Daily

93
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,079
Caller and so at this time we decided to

94
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,810
come out in a big way we came out to the

95
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,040
New York Times so we got this cool

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,739
article in the business section and and

97
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,319
for me as a tech marketer someone who's

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,790
been in marketing for my entire career

99
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,280
if I really view this as an opportunity

100
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,530
to start talking about what the bigger

101
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,509
picture is here like what's been what's

102
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:08,069
been happening in the past few years

103
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,560
because you know again um I don't want

104
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,169
to sound like an but like I I'm

105
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,549
like really fascinated at our own

106
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,529
campaign like I can't believe this

107
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,608
worked because all we've been doing for

108
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,200
the past three years is really just this

109
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,880
one simple mo

110
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,830
we've used this on everything from

111
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,870
Breitbart to everything that we've done

112
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,680
since then and the mo is this we present

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,050
to you information that we have found or

114
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,870
we've we've learned about and then we we

115
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,420
ask you the brand if it aligns with your

116
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,460
your value this is a brand and this is

117
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,840
what we find on your careers Peter

118
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,060
you're about as Paige the values that

119
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,390
you claim to stand for and then when we

120
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,160
put on that information we say okay well

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,870
you know what are you gonna do about it

122
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,520
now that you know it's kind of like a

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,230
challenge also gives you a chance to

124
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,830
respond as a brand and as I said we use

125
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,250
this MO on like everything that we've

126
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,830
we've we've worked on in the past few

127
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,250
years and in my opinion just based on

128
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,560
like from my perspective I think that

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,820
what's happened is that we've really

130
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,280
managed to shift the narrative over the

131
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,620
past few years I think the public really

132
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,480
has started to understand really

133
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,880
understands the relationship that tech

134
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,650
businesses and businesses in general

135
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,560
have with with white nationalism and

136
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,720
hate speech people really understand

137
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,580
that Tempest tech companies are

138
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,390
monetizing amplifying distributing hate

139
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,780
speech and and businesses and brands on

140
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,150
the other hand are monetizing it whether

141
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,080
they know it or not and so since I'm in

142
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,480
marketing you know gotta wrap this up in

143
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,370
a nice pretty way for marketing people

144
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,220
and business people so the this this

145
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,900
concept I came up with is the concept

146
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,720
that I'm sort of starting to to

147
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,580
communicate to to marketing audiences

148
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,010
and business audiences I really believe

149
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,680
that we have entered a new era like

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,090
there's no going back we're in this new

151
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,610
era of brand safety and I call it

152
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,850
answerability answerability is is like

153
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,970
unnecessary is where we are at now as a

154
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,740
result of you know this age of social

155
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,000
media you can't really get out of you

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,020
can't really get out of answering

157
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,130
questions at the age of social media

158
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,170
it's gonna follow you wherever you go so

159
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,480
this is something you can't ignore what

160
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,250
you have to do though what you have to

161
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,380
do instead is be aware that the way that

162
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,790
you answer the way that you don't answer

163
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,390
you then not answers count will result

164
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,160
in real-life business risks and rewards

165
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,129
so on one hand if you

166
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,349
you have your together and you know

167
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:41,239
you have a plan for for whatever is

168
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,179
coming your way you can get yourself

169
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,800
additional or grow your brand equity or

170
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,689
get yourself some positive PR if you

171
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:50,419
don't have an answer you could screw

172
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:51,679
yourself over or you could end up having

173
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,189
some reputational harm or even end up

174
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,409
with lawsuits on your hands and I really

175
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,769
believe that this two minutes holy

176
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:03,800
so I really believe that that we can use

177
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,659
this up this playbook that's not

178
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,580
playbook sorry this concept of answer

179
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,189
ability to take on misinformation we

180
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:12,619
think of misinformation as a a Russia

181
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:14,209
problem or you know we talked about it

182
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,249
in terms of regulation or breaking a big

183
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:17,389
tech but I want us to start thinking

184
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:19,580
about misinformation as a business

185
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,529
problem because what's been happening in

186
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:24,649
the past couple of or what happened in

187
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:26,360
the past couple of years is they they

188
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,579
told us grow matic advertising told us

189
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,469
that there would be unlimited reach and

190
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:32,899
ROI from you know engaging or you know

191
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,479
you know hiring eyes they promised all

192
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,009
of these things and none of them worked

193
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,649
out they said don't worry about how it

194
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:42,529
works we got this but the fact is that

195
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,309
they don't got this chase in 2017 chase

196
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:49,009
found that that they were appearing on

197
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,139
four hundred thousand websites and they

198
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,789
replaced it with a five thousand website

199
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:53,449
blacklist

200
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:55,159
sorry whitelist and they ended up with

201
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,839
the same results hmm that's curious

202
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,389
and then there's P&G so they they did

203
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,550
the same thing they realized okay we we

204
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,019
we cut our ad budget by two hundred

205
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,579
million dollars oh my god two hundred

206
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,229
million dollars and they increased their

207
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:09,199
reach by ten percent so the question is

208
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,659
where did that money go and and because

209
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,769
I don't have time to go through all of

210
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:15,319
these just you know a lot of it is going

211
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,269
to bad things it's going towards fake

212
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,529
news it's going towards misinformation

213
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:20,599
it's going towards terrorists the UK

214
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,129
government accidentally paid terrorists

215
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:23,779
two hundred fifty thousand pounds they

216
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,039
got a refund but that doesn't really

217
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:25,459
matter

218
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,400
debit

219
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,500
this one is more sad this is way sad but

220
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,919
the UK government told us in 2018 that

221
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,960
one out of ten child sex abuse websites

222
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,799
are being funded by by just our brands

223
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,919
you know our businesses so the point is

224
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,330
here that where there is smoke there is

225
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,130
fire we found the the root of the

226
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,680
problem with Breitbart but the but the

227
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,790
fact is that there's a much bigger

228
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,020
problem we need to be paying attention

229
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,820
to it's that one the money when we don't

230
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,960
know where the money is going as a

231
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,810
result of programmatic advertising turns

232
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,040
out that money is going towards

233
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,770
criminals and fraudsters and really

234
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,270
really bad people and we need to start

235
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,610
holding we need to change the question

236
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,960
that we're asking so we we've been

237
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,820
asking the question why are you letting

238
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,830
your ads fund Breitbart we need to start

239
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,930
asking why are you letting your ads fund

240
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,900
misinformation and every dollar that

241
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,390
goes to words towards funding

242
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,730
misinformation is a dollar that doesn't

243
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,230
go towards our Free Press and every

244
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,910
dollar that makes it towards child abuse

245
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,070
is a form of money laundering we need to

246
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,670
ask brands to start holding ad tech

247
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,320
responsible and and that's what I think

248
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,370
was one of the most effective things

249
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,750
that we can do moving forward through

250
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,550
these elections at least from my

251
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,640
perspective I gotta go thank you so much

252
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,760
[Applause]
