1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:10,100
why is this child crying I suppose many

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,139
of you think of a different reason

3
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:14,990
why she could be crying maybe she feels

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,960
cold or maybe she misses her parents or

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,610
maybe she fell down and hurt herself

6
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,850
there are many ways many reasons why

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,850
this child could be crying and then what

8
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,330
kind of film can you expect to see this

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:36,140
image maybe it will be in a fictional

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,719
drama about the sweet child or maybe an

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,109
educational movie about bullying again

12
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,789
there are many ways this image can be

13
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:48,139
used and reused in media how easy it is

14
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:50,839
to be manipulated by media and how

15
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,269
recommen applied it themselves is what

16
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:56,479
youngster experienced during the two-day

17
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,870
media mash up workshop and for you this

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,229
is all obvious information you think

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,879
this what is she talking about we

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,920
already knew this but for the youngsters

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,000
at school they don't really think about

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,659
these teams and so this workshop really

23
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,979
helps to get an awareness from this hi

24
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,850
I'm Alfie I'm from Geoff and I will

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,820
share a little bit what we do there are

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,549
youth film organization and we arrange

27
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:31,570
distribution of youth and children films

28
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,450
and for each film we make a study guide

29
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,149
which is downloadable for free and which

30
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,270
is connected to a Pinterest page and

31
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,280
YouTube channel where you can find many

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,289
clips about the film and also an

33
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,689
introduction film made by the filmmaker

34
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,719
it's himself we organize workshops Q&A

35
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,289
is master classes with filmmakers and

36
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,820
also on top of that we have a Children

37
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,429
and Youth Film Festival with a Media Lab

38
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,799
it's like a digital playground where

39
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,130
they can experience different PR

40
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,429
installations and things thanks to the

41
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,490
Flemish government's call for innovative

42
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,920
partner projects

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,020
it was possible to develop this media

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,120
mashup workshop and we partnered up with

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,900
Miriam s it's the knowledge center of

46
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,210
media literacy in flowers and Kingsbury

47
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,840
a digital marketing agency we used our

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,850
years of expertise in the development of

49
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,310
film workshops in order to assemble all

50
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,450
this knowledge into a two-day program

51
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,510
for youngsters 12 to 18 and mostly in

52
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,270
formal education and with this program

53
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,730
we want to reinforce awareness about

54
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,550
modern propaganda in an active and

55
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,070
creative way what do you think about

56
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,460
when you hear the word propaganda this

57
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,850
is what we asked them and soon we

58
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,640
started talking about World War 2 and

59
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,970
Hitler and many students thought it is

60
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,280
something from long time ago

61
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,270
and they discover it is still used on a

62
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,090
daily basis thanks to the platform mind

63
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,190
over media this is a platform for

64
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,140
understanding 21st century propaganda

65
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,450
developed by Renee hubs and the media

66
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,040
education lab it's where you can upload

67
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,400
all kinds of modern propaganda and the

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,820
students watch some clips analyze them

69
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,190
and had some debate about a different

70
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,940
propaganda techniques used and followed

71
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,100
by some active exercises because

72
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,500
learning by doing is embedded in our

73
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,320
methodology and I recently discovered an

74
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,870
old proverb of Confucius that agrees

75
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,840
with this I'll share it with you what I

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,440
hear I forget what I see I remember and

77
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,550
what I do I understand so a lot of

78
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,790
active doing in our workshops and to

79
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,790
experiment how they can manipulate these

80
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,029
images they can use the fantastic mashup

81
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,790
table this is an installation which is

82
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,450
developed by an French magician and I'm

83
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,180
not sure if you are familiar with the

84
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,400
filmmaking process

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,050
normally at the end of the workshop the

86
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,930
editing is done by one or two computer

87
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,229
savvy kids and the others lose interest

88
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:38,150
in this process which is very

89
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,699
interesting to to do in filmmaking

90
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,340
because they can't engage and this

91
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,430
mashup table makes it possible to make

92
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,840
editing a shared event and everybody can

93
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,180
have an active part in it and to have

94
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,310
give you a little taste of what it's

95
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,220
like I have a short film about as you

96
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,699
can see

97
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:16,469
you

98
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,940
so the students play around with

99
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,800
existing video clips and they give them

100
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,800
another meaning than intended and this

101
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,470
demonstrates how easily an image can be

102
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,130
used reused misused remember The Crying

103
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,740
girl from the beginning I wonder how

104
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,480
many thought of you the real reason why

105
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,220
she was crying she was having a fit

106
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,810
because she didn't get any ice cream

107
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,230
afterwards they think about the

108
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,520
youngster think about what they would

109
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,280
like to change in society something they

110
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,890
feel strongly about and how they can

111
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,720
translate this translator ideas into a

112
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,660
positive propaganda film so they use the

113
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,730
techniques they learned and make a

114
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,890
positive propaganda film about something

115
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,680
there were different topics bullying use

116
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,070
of social media female rights and by

117
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,840
using these propaganda techniques

118
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,460
themselves they show that they

119
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,070
understand them as you can read in some

120
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,410
quotes here of participants the medium

121
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,730
film combines different medium media

122
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,140
elements it's combines image sound text

123
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,840
and that's why it makes it one of the

124
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,710
very powerful communication tool and by

125
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,930
teaching youngsters how to use this they

126
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,120
can choose to participate in only in

127
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,570
online debate with media content of

128
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,910
their own and that they want to be heard

129
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,450
is very clearly seen with what's

130
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,560
happening with the climate movement and

131
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,070
I'm glad to see that the attention for

132
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,840
media literacy is growing and that we're

133
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,870
here today for the first time I heard it

134
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,910
was that this topic is at this kind of

135
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,430
conference and also proud that we

136
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,690
received the first award from European

137
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,510
Commission but there are still a lot of

138
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,750
work obviously and on the way over here

139
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,550
on the train I read a very interesting

140
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,530
opinion piece in The New York Times

141
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,030
about how racist groups are recruiting

142
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,790
young teens through social media with

143
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,940
funny memes and and it was about a

144
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,220
mother and her teen son and he was

145
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,010
laughing with his memes quite serious

146
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,270
stuff and she felt very worried about

147
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,710
this and her thought was that probably

148
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,480
the best tool to tackle this is

149
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,380
prevention and I totally agree because

150
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,830
it is important that youngsters

151
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,450
understand that propaganda has many

152
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,700
forms before they even encounter it at

153
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,930
first because it's not always that

154
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,680
obvious to detect and propaganda can

155
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,470
also be for example a smooth-talking

156
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,880
youtuber and thank you very much for

157
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,760
inviting here I think I'm nicely in time

158
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,400
and to end with them in an appropriate

159
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,950
way I have made an extreme small mashup

160
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,370
[Music]

161
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,480
you

162
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:46,179
[Applause]
