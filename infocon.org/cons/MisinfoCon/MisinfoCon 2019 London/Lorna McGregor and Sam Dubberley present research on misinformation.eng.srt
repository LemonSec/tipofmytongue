1
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:06,810
good morning everyone my name is Lauren

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,250
or McGregor I'm from the Human Rights

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,380
Center at the University of Essex where

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,629
I work together with some EE on the

5
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:14,519
Human Rights big data and technology

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,460
project but Sam is also at Amnesty

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,490
International within the Human Rights

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,560
big data and technology project our goal

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,990
is to address high technologies today

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,070
and tomorrow impact Human Rights we look

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,470
at how states and businesses are

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,890
developing and using the technologies

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,780
and we sure how Human Rights principles

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,750
can help to ensure that human rights are

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,750
protected that strong oversight and

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,640
accountability frameworks are in place

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,640
and that individuals and groups are able

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,020
to enjoy the right to an effective

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,010
remedy our work not only focuses on the

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,280
AI sector and how to regulate it but we

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,560
also carry out deep dives into the use

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,170
of particular technologies in particular

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:01,980
contexts

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,769
these include algorithmic accountability

25
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,409
looking at facial recognition

26
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,479
technologies by law enforcement and at

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,759
the border in the provision of health

28
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,939
care and Social Care in the humanitarian

29
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,880
sector and in relation to missing

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,390
disinformation here we'll hear a lot

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,570
today about higher elections and the

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,210
threat posed by disinformation in the

33
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,340
digital age is threatening our human

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,039
rights we've seen allegations in the

35
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,710
last few years about how different

36
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,319
actors including elected officials and

37
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,899
foreign States have used this

38
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,939
information to try to influence the

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,729
outcome of elections this is involved

40
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,009
targeting and discrediting of candidates

41
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,679
and political parties as well as

42
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:51,990
attempts to influence the voting choices

43
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,920
of particular groups in society but

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,229
dealing with disinformation election

45
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,920
context while it's critical particularly

46
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,929
the threats it pulls us to democracy

47
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:08,340
it's about much more than that this is a

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,820
global practice with us threatening our

49
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,340
human rights in many more ways than just

50
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,740
elections in the US and

51
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,310
Europe in our work we're showing how

52
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,320
disinformation can generate a lack of

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,540
trust and institutions including in

54
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,610
public health leading to people

55
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,660
rejecting critical preventive treatments

56
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,160
we're showing how it can be used to

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,250
generate backlash fear opposition and

58
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,670
the other of individuals and communities

59
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,070
leading to hate speech discrimination on

60
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,040
and off line and then it's worst hate

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,410
crimes and risks to security and even

62
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,350
life we're showing how this information

63
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,210
can be used to crack down on public

64
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,300
protests and political dissent and how

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,190
it's having a chilling effect on freedom

66
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,280
of opinion expression assembly and

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,130
Association and we're also seeing how

68
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,500
states have responded disproportionately

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,040
to disinformation by adopting highly

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,350
restrictive anti disinformation laws

71
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,500
which in and of themselves can impact

72
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,150
upon freedom of expression and

73
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,060
Association imposed particular risks to

74
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,270
human rights defenders and journalists

75
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,070
so let me give some my examples in my

76
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,570
work at Amnesty International we have

77
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,460
encountered disinformation when

78
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,470
monitoring a number of situations

79
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,930
take for instance Hong Kong in June of

80
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,570
this year protests started in Hong Kong

81
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,220
against a new bill allowing citizens to

82
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,740
be extradited to China raising the very

83
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,560
real threat of political oppression

84
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,850
these protests for the vast part

85
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,640
peaceful be met by violence Hong Kong

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,320
hasn't seen for several decades

87
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,480
police have beaten protesters fired

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,970
teargas canisters directly at them fired

89
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,030
rubber coated bullets and lightly lately

90
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,700
live ammunition all of this has been

91
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,650
live streamed on social media platforms

92
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,480
with the video shared on closed and

93
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,300
opening open messaging apps amnesty has

94
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,490
spent time verifying all of this in its

95
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,830
call for an impartial inquiry into the

96
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,720
actions of the police a call that of

97
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,580
course has not yet been heard at the

98
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,709
same time Chinese authorities have waged

99
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,510
a disinformation campaign against the

100
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,298
protesters and the start the protests

101
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,339
were largely ignored by Chinese media

102
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,640
but then we saw a shift first memes of

103
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,830
protesters photoshopped into cockroaches

104
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,240
and framing of the protests in

105
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,320
mainstream Chinese media is Tara

106
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,170
posing a threat to national security

107
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,850
this impacts on the rights of civilians

108
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,340
in Hong Kong to enjoy their right to

109
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,230
protest their right to take to the

110
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,810
streets it's also sown discord in the

111
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,610
local community picking pitting Hong

112
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,670
Kong is against our Hong Kongers

113
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,360
authoring the protesters in Kashmir the

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,670
issue is different the lack of video and

115
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,170
photography has led to an increased

116
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,940
different disinformation campaign in

117
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,610
that crisis situation an internet

118
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,960
shutdown since August and their

119
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,400
withdrawal of access for journalists

120
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,290
during the recent clampdown has provided

121
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,990
fertile ground for agenda-setting with

122
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,700
no reporting nobody truly know what

123
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,070
nobody truly knows what's going on there

124
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,900
both India and Pakistan have been

125
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,340
attempting to fill that fill the

126
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,100
reporting vacuum AFP the French Press

127
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,080
Association has reported on the

128
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,880
circulation of all videos depicting

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
brutality from other locations in

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
Pakistani social media groups to make

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,290
claims against against Kashmiris in

132
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,540
India it's the opposite with videos and

133
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,460
photographs depicting a peaceful life in

134
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,010
the Kashmir Valley during their rounds

135
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,000
all this goes to show that

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,130
disinformation has consequences for our

137
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,710
human rights human rights organisations

138
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,390
monitors and researchers are well used

139
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,490
to the disinformation game we've been in

140
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,140
it for years

141
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,700
human rights investigators are attacked

142
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,760
as parties on biased a tool of others

143
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,160
rather than the empower impartial fact

144
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,410
finders that we are we've had the fake

145
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,460
news trope thrown at us many many times

146
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,080
we've had the claims of bias thrown at

147
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,580
us we've been accused of spreading

148
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,370
conspiracy theories we're so used to it

149
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,560
we have a name for it we call it the

150
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,010
human rights violators playbook five

151
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,800
main tactics there are they question our

152
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,020
impartial impartiality they should as

153
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,750
down they attack us they ask the what

154
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,250
about question pointing your finger

155
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,590
elsewhere to distract attention they

156
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,359
deny completely pretend it didn't happen

157
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,330
that is the deliberate spreading of

158
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,340
false information to influence the way

159
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,680
in which people think and act are

160
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,920
becoming a key part of the updated human

161
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,070
rights violators playbook however we're

162
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,990
also starting to see another kind of

163
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,260
problem emerge

164
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,900
this is where actress claimed the

165
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,450
allegations of key of crimes and human

166
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,430
rights violations are disinformation

167
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,390
themselves or fake news in order to deny

168
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,690
that they've even happened denial has

169
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,060
long been atactic employed to cover up

170
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,490
crimes and human rights violations in

171
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,700
his seminal book states of denial the

172
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,750
late professor Stanley Stanley Cohen

173
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,490
documents the use of denial too by

174
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,590
making a deliberate intentional and

175
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,780
conscious statement that it's meant to

176
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,320
deceive in order to spread propaganda

177
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,020
disinformation whitewash manipulation

178
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,990
spin and misinformation these are his

179
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,830
words previously if people saw a video

180
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,350
or an image of human rights violation

181
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,600
which in itself is very difficult often

182
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,510
to actually get they would usually not

183
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,240
question its veracity indeed the

184
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,770
prosecutor of the International Criminal

185
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,770
Court as issued arrest warrants based

186
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,620
for the most part on videos collected

187
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,130
from Facebook and videos from YouTube

188
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,630
are making up part of a recent

189
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,490
submission to the European Court of

190
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,640
Human Rights however with the advent of

191
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,520
synthetic media and deep fakes people's

192
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,220
trust in institutions and their

193
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,650
confidence in telling whether an image

194
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,190
or a recording is real is starting to

195
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,370
wane this is providing certain actors

196
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,860
with the perfect opportunity to simply

197
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,030
deny claims of human rights violations

198
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,520
for example in 2017 unsung spooky

199
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,260
dismissal reports of what the UN called

200
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,900
possible genocide in Myanmar as fake

201
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,660
news using a case of misinformation to

202
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,910
make the claim that August's people

203
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,740
started across a border between Myanmar

204
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,450
and Bangladesh telling stories of

205
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,059
killings and burnings the Deputy Prime

206
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,309
Minister of Turkey tweeted calling for

207
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,409
the world to act act to stop this

208
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,559
emerging crisis he tweeted out pictures

209
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
he said were of massacres in Myanmar

210
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,450
barrace from other events elsewhere our

211
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,430
sang-soo yuki leveraged these images to

212
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,990
make headlines in the new york times and

213
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,750
other global media in zimbabwe this

214
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,100
summer when a trade union leader

215
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,980
reported that he was

216
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,990
ducted and tortured by the government

217
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,480
for organizing a teacher strike over pay

218
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,850
an army of internet trolls was unleashed

219
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,430
to counter the claims some claimed he

220
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,960
had been targeted by the husband of a

221
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,820
woman he was cheating with while others

222
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,290
claimed he had been attacked by a bus

223
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,440
crew for refusing to pay the fare some

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,240
suggested that tomato ketchup had been

225
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,640
smeared on his back instead of diverting

226
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,110
a government official rolled out the

227
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,270
fake news trope a government official

228
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,950
from the information ministry called the

229
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,290
abduction fake news dismissing the

230
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,600
photographs of the scars on his back is

231
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,630
old when so-called deep fakes or

232
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,160
synthetic media reached a level of full

233
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,260
con visibility that we really are not

234
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,900
sure what is real and what is not the

235
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,580
challenge for human rights investigators

236
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,320
wishing to use audio-visual comment

237
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,390
content to prove human rights violations

238
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,060
will be greater than simple verification

239
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,370
the challenge will not be just spotting

240
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,770
if a piece of media is real or synthetic

241
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,570
it will be countering claims and an

242
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,790
authentic piece of audio-visual content

243
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,830
is fake news from the perpetrators

244
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,560
themselves the academics Chesney and

245
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,930
citron call this inability to show that

246
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,360
something real is real the Liars

247
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,390
dividend indeed in its recent report

248
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,130
deep fake labs an organization dedicated

249
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,830
to detecting deep fakes highlight the

250
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,420
growing awareness of deep fakes is

251
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,780
already damaging political discourse and

252
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,640
undermining the perceived objectivity of

253
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,740
recorded video in politically charged

254
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,470
contexts this is only going to get worse

255
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,740
unless we act and investigate so how do

256
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,670
we come to this

257
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,060
the solution isn't solely technical for

258
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,890
a human rights organisation like Amnesty

259
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,300
International it's about making sure

260
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,670
that the fight against disinformation is

261
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,990
central to our work

262
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,090
this means we incorporate the fight

263
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,830
against this information to our research

264
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,680
ensuring it's reflected in our core

265
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,380
values at Amnesty International and at

266
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,180
the University of Essex it's about

267
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,670
ensuring academic and advocacy based

268
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,310
human rights research and campaigning

269
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,370
reflects a disinformation the sorry the

270
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,230
reflects a disinformation ecosphere that

271
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,630
we're in today and that we take a human

272
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,480
rights-based approach to this research

273
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
ensuring that all our work meets and

274
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,570
norms and standards enshrined in

275
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,580
international human rights law

276
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,310
this is new to the human right space but

277
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,839
what we have tried to show here is that

278
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,670
this information is not only about

279
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,790
elections it's about ensuring that every

280
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,040
right that we enjoy today continues to

281
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,800
be enjoyed thank you very much

282
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,959
