00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:37,719
questions whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up and let's go</font>

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,100
to some facts about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CTF so first of</font>

14
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">all let's talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,199
participation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we had over a thousand</font>

16
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,269
teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a new record</font>

17
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:47,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a four digit</font>

18
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:48,850
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're really hyped</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,179
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cool</font>

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,460
we had verified<font color="#E5E5E5"> local teams playing here</font>

21
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:57,370
maybe some who didn't really come to our

22
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:02,170
desk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and show themselves as a local team</font>

23
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:07,210
but 14 people came and verified that

24
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">team we had actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 303 teams of the</font>
