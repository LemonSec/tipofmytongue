00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:11,260
skip it so good morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> my name is</font>

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,268
Attila<font color="#E5E5E5"> Moorish a and i work for sofas</font>

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:18,430
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic will be about where</font>

4
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:22,150
should I host my more so a couple of

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:25,990
words about the agenda the first thing

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:30,070
we will touch that how to collect IP

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:33,489
address for which are belongs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> FTP</font>

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:38,680
servers it's very easy nowadays how to

9
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:41,620
make some tests which with some costume

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:46,030
one and how you can test the IP address

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:49,000
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have some additional needs for</font>

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:52,059
for testing them and then we will

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,789
analyze the results we will touch one

14
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:58,809
mower I want threat which abuse this

15
00:00:54,789 --> 00:01:03,309
protocol and there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some funny</font>

16
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:05,979
faces at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the presentation so</font>

17
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:09,100
how to collect and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP address</font>

18
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">which are belongs to two dedicated</font>

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,130
protocols nowadays it's very bubbling

20
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,490
topic and there are a couple of services

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:24,789
you can use nowadays for example so down

22
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:28,210
or chances or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the scanning</font>

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:31,750
process by your own but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it</font>

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:34,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it it's expensive type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

25
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:39,040
something and there are good services to

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,740
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I not interesting on the</font>

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,380
protocol itself I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,009
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> more so if there is someone</font>

29
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,229
who already did this job<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just use the</font>

30
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:53,049
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and do the next step and</font>

31
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:58,600
analyze the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the on the servers</font>

32
00:01:53,049 --> 00:02:03,250
or or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we get soon in this</font>

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,969
research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ordinary days I use</font>

34
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:11,709
census to get a good hint about the

35
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:15,549
device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP address so how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could a</font>

36
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:18,610
process looks like that

37
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I get preferred that data from one of</font>

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,820
the service as i mentioned i use census

39
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:30,730
that do the test in this case I test the

40
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:34,079
ftp servers to check the port 21 is it

41
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:38,380
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tries to log in with anonymous</font>

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,590
users and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could it tries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to right</font>

43
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,220
the disk and test that do we have write

44
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:49,060
access on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the D store or not which is</font>

45
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:52,480
not very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think and then we get</font>

46
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:56,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> results and then analyze it so how</font>

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,899
this process could looks like then get

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,079
the IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> address check it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then and fill</font>

49
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,890
the list so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want it in this</font>

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,080
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need some other tools for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

51
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> developed a scanner it's called</font>

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,770
scanner framework which could be fitted

53
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:18,430
with IP addresses you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font>

54
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:23,170
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can create easy and very</font>

55
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:27,820
tiny python modules to do some test case

56
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:31,690
and collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results in a very</font>

57
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:35,230
generic way so you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for</font>

58
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:40,030
put it to the map or feed other services

59
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:42,220
with the results and or maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> feed and</font>

60
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,510
other tests so you can link the test

61
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:49,600
with each other in this screen as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

62
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:54,130
can see in it there were more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 3</font>

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:57,850
million IP addresses and finally in this

64
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:03,730
pass in this task is there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 key</font>

65
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:08,530
IP address which pass the test so more

66
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:12,880
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> details so from census we got</font>

67
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:16,959
more than 12 million IP addresses which

68
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,269
belongs to ftp services and we didn't

69
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test all of depth so we just get</font>

70
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,820
three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half million to test it</font>

71
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,610
because this process is not so fast and

72
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,849
didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test all of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to</font>

73
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,820
just

74
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:39,390
set of them so I test three and a half

75
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:42,280
million of them so the reason was that

76
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:46,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-one percent was restricted which</font>

77
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,619
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good nine percent was when you</font>

78
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:53,430
were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to log</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in with with anonymous</font>

79
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:57,210
login credentials and there was zero

80
00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:02,410
percentage where you have write access

81
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:07,510
how this<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero looks like in a map that's</font>

82
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:12,580
not bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the zero was a 10k so there</font>

83
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:14,580
was in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> dataset ten key IP address</font>

84
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,580
and devices where you have write access

85
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,190
so where you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to copy</font>

86
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,580
anything there or ride the things which

87
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,950
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> already there overwrite and change</font>

88
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:31,140
the content of it or just put something

89
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:34,450
and hold there so you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-key new</font>

90
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,419
IP address to host anything you would

91
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,599
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have to mention</font>

92
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there are so many public data or</font>

93
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,860
sorry personal data privacy data which

94
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:53,170
also could be could be downloaded or

95
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:56,410
were hijacked in this way so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we focus</font>

96
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,840
on an anonymous servers where we have

97
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,680
the ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in with anonymous</font>

98
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,890
credential there were four percentage

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:10,570
the 10k when we have the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

100
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:13,300
and when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the right access 70</font>

101
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:20,469
person has already infected with one

102
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:23,350
threat more minor<font color="#CCCCCC"> c c and the average of</font>

103
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,140
the full infection is roughly ninety

104
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,710
percent so that means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you offer</font>

105
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:32,650
an IP and with the ftp servers with the

106
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,500
ability to write for anyone it will

107
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:39,669
write and there will be used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

108
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:43,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">for some more stuff or back doors or</font>

109
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:47,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying's so if you if you let it</font>

110
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:51,880
they will do it if you use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> raishin</font>

111
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:57,639
for the 12 million that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

112
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:00,430
roughly 40,000 IP address could be used

113
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:07,810
for this purpose and in this way which

114
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:11,470
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quite big number i think so some</font>

115
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:15,340
interesting cases the first one is

116
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:19,600
seagate Seagate central which has a

117
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:22,750
design<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow they provide this is not the</font>

118
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">only one there are many vendors who use</font>

119
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:30,460
this structure and also a cig it has a

120
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:34,419
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> West which use by other web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> browser</font>

121
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:37,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">supplies so you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find this in</font>

122
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:41,099
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors as well so they provide</font>

123
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,419
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to create users and and</font>

124
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:48,130
folders which are restricted and

125
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:52,539
accesses by the users only sounds very

126
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:55,240
secure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems very good but the</font>

127
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:57,880
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> they provide and they give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

128
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,389
default account and the default folder

129
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:05,349
called public and if you would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

130
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:08,560
reach the device remotely which is a

131
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:12,159
very good feature to share to access

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,039
your private data and you have to turn

133
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,919
on the remote access and then in this

134
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,440
situation you<font color="#E5E5E5"> let anyone to access the</font>

135
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,639
public folder and the public content of

136
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:29,340
it and if you maybe map<font color="#CCCCCC"> your you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

137
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:32,620
inside your net a whole network you will

138
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:37,990
work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two folders and maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

139
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">confuse with the data there so there is</font>

140
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:43,959
no need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to no chance to turn it off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

141
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,890
and many users isn't know that and they

142
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:51,849
already opened the door for for anyone

143
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:55,560
so in this situation there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 300</font>

144
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:58,500
roughly 300 the devices which

145
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,010
found on the on the internet which was

146
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,920
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that means you get a very good</font>

147
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:13,189
ability and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge amount storage to</font>

148
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:17,010
host your data which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font>

149
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:21,480
receive they use the same framework the

150
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:25,650
use the same package so the problem is

151
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same and in here and there is also a</font>

152
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:32,670
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of terabytes you can use for for</font>

153
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:40,650
any purpose and as we be so that it's

154
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:44,279
used so we we saw more minor C on many

155
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,699
devices it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a very fancy stuff or</font>

156
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:50,430
something as you will leave you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go see</font>

157
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,890
if you log into a Seagate central one of

158
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:56,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Seagate central or even IP address</font>

159
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:59,939
which already infected or host I'm over

160
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:03,720
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe see something like this so as</font>

161
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:07,320
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see there is a there is a photos</font>

162
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:11,490
folder and there is a photo ser which is

163
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:14,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you map that the device</font>

164
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,130
map that folder you maybe we'll confused

165
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:21,080
with the names and as you will see the

166
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:23,720
icon also could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be could be something</font>

167
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,180
confuse you so the folder of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

168
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,700
application is a folder sorry the icon

169
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,780
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application is a folder so maybe</font>

170
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:37,230
just click on the the wrong wrong line

171
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:42,290
and just start the application on your

172
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:47,400
on your PC it's a crypto minor

173
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:52,430
application a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years ago there</font>

174
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:57,209
were many mining stuff and Bitcoin miner

175
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">mower but after a time the bad guys</font>

176
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:01,050
realized that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost</font>

177
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,870
effective or that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good way to</font>

178
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:08,079
earn<font color="#CCCCCC"> money because mining the</font>

179
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:11,800
cryptocurrency or mining bitcoins

180
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:15,660
not so easy so personal pc is not good

181
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,939
for it but the cryptocurrencies are

182
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:23,230
worrying you stuff and the difficulty is

183
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:25,570
much less so if you join to this group

184
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,990
and store the mining in in the right

185
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,270
time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can earn good money with it so</font>

186
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,270
in this situation they just create a

187
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:39,490
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> dummy application a based on</font>

188
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:42,939
NC script and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's took three version of</font>

189
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:46,300
the crypto minor application which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

190
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,970
stock<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so there were no needs to</font>

191
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,709
develop or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it could be</font>

192
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:56,170
developed a couple of days the whole

193
00:11:50,710 --> 00:12:01,150
stuff so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no big effort on it</font>

194
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:03,579
how it sir let's get spread if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

195
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,790
an infected machine it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying and</font>

196
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,980
scanning the internet for open<font color="#CCCCCC"> ftps</font>

197
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:13,180
where they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right to write and</font>

198
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:16,570
copy the application itself so if you

199
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:19,150
open your nose or something they just

200
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,160
copy the application there and maybe you

201
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:27,100
will be confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're browsing</font>

202
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:31,060
your your own nation and accidentally

203
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:34,000
store the application then your pc we of

204
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:37,569
mine the cryptocurrency and also scan

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to seek new IP address a</font>

206
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:44,560
new devices where it could hope copy the

207
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:48,750
instance of it so the spreading process

208
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,589
is very dummy it's very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

209
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:59,290
but as you can see it's already infected

210
00:12:52,590 --> 00:13:02,470
seventy percent of the open<font color="#CCCCCC"> EFTPS the</font>

211
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,920
tftp<font color="#E5E5E5"> exa XE that's the that's the</font>

212
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:09,510
application which scanning the internet

213
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:15,060
and if they found the web related stuff

214
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:18,569
HD mph be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this they just</font>

215
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:21,260
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trying to infect it with</font>

216
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:24,110
putting an iframe

217
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,060
the the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the file and that code</font>

218
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:31,220
that if you open a page which already

219
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:34,010
infected you will download a zip file

220
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:39,770
info zip file which needs some social

221
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:42,350
engineering or very clean user to to get

222
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the results and the inside content of</font>

223
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,440
the zip but it seems it's also working

224
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:52,069
so that's the that's the line when they

225
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,180
add some iframe so if the user is enough

226
00:13:52,070 --> 00:14:01,640
key into to get it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open it and</font>

227
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:05,800
final execute<font color="#CCCCCC"> them over so which makes</font>

228
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:08,480
this this more interesting for me that

229
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:15,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually we do not have information about</font>

230
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:18,770
the molars how much money do we have a

231
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,230
couple of information but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to</font>

232
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,680
accept information how much money was

233
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:28,070
earned<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a dedicated threat but in</font>

234
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,969
this situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mall and the miner</font>

235
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:36,140
was you use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monaro pool and if you</font>

236
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,660
have the hash for the miner you can get

237
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:44,030
the details of the of the results how

238
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:48,740
much money was paid how the hash what is

239
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:52,490
the battery so it makes much interesting

240
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:56,210
so that needs a doubtful skates on the

241
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:59,860
the NCS file and this includes all the

242
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:04,390
information we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> so all the all the</font>

243
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:08,840
ashes which needed we have so there were

244
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:13,910
20 ashes which was used and here you can

245
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the results so</font>

246
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,300
we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to track them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> order and how</font>

247
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:23,330
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> money they can earn with with this</font>

248
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:28,189
single a threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

249
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:34,010
six thousand euros each day it's not bad

250
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:34,880
and 3000 3000 it's very very good for

251
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:39,080
from all

252
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,770
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first time we</font>

253
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,620
have exit exit<font color="#E5E5E5"> date about the about the</font>

254
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:50,150
mall<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so it's very really good and</font>

255
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:54,790
and based on how difficult is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

256
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:58,400
it's very very good so my favorites

257
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:01,120
there were some NASA's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am already</font>

258
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:05,890
shown you and there are some some

259
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:09,260
professional devices which a little bit

260
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:13,819
scary i think one of it the natural

261
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff it it's a CCTV stuff you can you</font>

262
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:21,800
can monitor big buildings or or things

263
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:24,530
with with these professional devices if

264
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:29,329
you sense this and you know how to

265
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:34,220
search them you can find a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

266
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:38,630
them and it's a tricky<font color="#CCCCCC"> Querrey because I</font>

267
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:42,310
filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the the ftp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bonner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but least</font>

268
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:45,890
the talent boner so the two protocol

269
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:48,290
used and if you check the<font color="#CCCCCC"> boners you can</font>

270
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,689
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turnin bundles which</font>

271
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:56,689
requires<font color="#CCCCCC"> user names and there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turnin</font>

272
00:16:50,690 --> 00:17:00,020
bonnet which from the from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> command</font>

273
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:03,590
line so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are two</font>

274
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">times one of requires login credentials</font>

275
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:16,490
and one just opened the device so check

276
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:19,698
the second group roughly<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000 devices</font>

277
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:23,300
which totally open and use with basic

278
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:25,939
credential basic default settings which

279
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:31,040
do not require any logins or something

280
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:34,460
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open it in in Tallinn you can</font>

281
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,820
you can get a prompt and you can do

282
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:41,090
whatever you would like to do so it's

283
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,179
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary I think you can modify</font>

284
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,500
the data you can change and at least

285
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,950
anything you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

286
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,880
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same IP address and login</font>

287
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:57,920
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTP and check the device in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

288
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:02,850
side on this angle you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

289
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:05,610
there are already many actors and<font color="#CCCCCC"> motors</font>

290
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">which tries to put some malicious</font>

291
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,740
content on on the device as you can see

292
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:14,250
the mole miners is already there and

293
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:19,080
which is very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary the user</font>

294
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface folder is just just the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom</font>

295
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,510
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you can reach the the user</font>

296
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,750
interface and you can reach the firmware

297
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:30,930
through the ftp using<font color="#E5E5E5"> weed anonymous</font>

298
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,300
access so if you would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

299
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:36,300
something on the on the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

300
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:41,010
like to change the video viewer

301
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:43,110
application the applet or or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

302
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,980
like to download all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the camera</font>

303
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:49,860
credentials or web configurations or

304
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:55,260
something you you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily do that</font>

305
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:57,409
because they use one and folder for for

306
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:02,780
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can reach it by</font>

307
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:05,820
anonymous access so in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> test we have</font>

308
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,850
roughly ten to twenty percent of the

309
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,159
device can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be accessed so you can get</font>

310
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">the videos as well and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

311
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:17,450
something there and modify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> firmware</font>

312
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:22,170
if you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so it's very scary</font>

313
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:25,470
but my favorite one is a sorry I have to

314
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:28,950
change a little bit not too easy to find

315
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:34,340
the device because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use for for</font>

316
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:41,310
scada purpose or to control devices

317
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:44,280
there are so many gadgets they offered

318
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:47,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are Reuters and collectors there</font>

319
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:52,530
are sensors and and many many things and

320
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:57,710
it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used by Y vendors to set up</font>

321
00:19:52,530 --> 00:20:00,370
a very fancy and practical stuff like

322
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,770
lights could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected</font>

323
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:05,770
with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the controller and you can</font>

324
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:08,350
control the<font color="#E5E5E5"> destroyed light through the</font>

325
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the web you can create scripts</font>

326
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:15,760
this device could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> controlled with</font>

327
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,860
python script which makes it much easy

328
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,559
to develop an to create a very

329
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,830
sophisticated system so it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

330
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,559
nice but the problem if you do not

331
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:31,300
change the basic settings it's totally

332
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:33,970
open so you have everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 and so</font>

333
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,610
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to gain with it to</font>

334
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:40,210
track it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect the information from</font>

335
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:43,290
it and as you see the middle of there is

336
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:46,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python part so you can check that</font>

337
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:50,320
the script which are already<font color="#E5E5E5"> there or as</font>

338
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,179
you can see the list of the devices

339
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:59,730
which are already<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected and</font>

340
00:20:52,179 --> 00:21:04,390
controlled by this equipment this user

341
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:08,850
3g network and as you can see we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

342
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:14,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information about the 3g network so</font>

343
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:18,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> digestion stop stop so if you reuse</font>

344
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:23,428
the codes we can find easily in the

345
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:27,880
device on a map which is quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary and</font>

346
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:30,400
if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the lighting stuff or</font>

347
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,840
something you can check the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python port</font>

348
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,480
and you can you can manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Skip so</font>

349
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:42,639
if you have a better<font color="#CCCCCC"> one you may be</font>

350
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:45,790
uploaded and you can put some additional

351
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,420
feature to the to the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> to control</font>

352
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:52,720
it as you can see others already done

353
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,840
with it and trying maybe python is not

354
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the correct language for it but</font>

355
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes they will figure out that</font>

356
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:05,980
which which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the correct</font>

357
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:09,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">ROM so if you search for these devices</font>

358
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,310
you will find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great amount of this and</font>

359
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,260
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very good equipment so you</font>

360
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:16,149
just write the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python script</font>

361
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,160
for the purpose you would like to add

362
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:24,360
that load attend<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a couple of</font>

363
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">hosts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 to do the dirty job for for you</font>

364
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:30,909
so that was my presentation I think

365
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:36,300
there were so many Falls there so for

366
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:39,280
conclusions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mostly vendors have two</font>

367
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:44,169
more folk wisdom on security not

368
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:47,410
providing detail default credentials at

369
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:50,680
all because as you can see twenty

370
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:54,730
percent of the the professional users

371
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:57,930
could use it with it so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

372
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:03,960
default is something which should be a

373
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:03,960
colonel<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

374
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:33,129
any questions to Tyler hi have you tried

375
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:35,650
cleaning up the devices after you see

376
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:39,850
that you can also hack them removing the

377
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:43,169
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> infection no no because I yeah it's</font>

378
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:46,899
very tricky want to modify the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

379
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:49,750
think to test it and get information

380
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:54,760
about publicly available devices not

381
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:58,809
using default credential what<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be the</font>

382
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:01,480
anonymous user is something like open

383
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:04,240
for example if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a IP address and</font>

384
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,350
just open<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it with a browser you use</font>

385
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:12,970
the autonomous<font color="#CCCCCC"> garden show which may be</font>

386
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:17,559
not problematic so you can get the list

387
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the device on the device but make</font>

388
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:23,428
modification on the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

389
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:27,790
kind of tricky i think it could be harm

390
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:30,190
you can you can alert the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the owner of</font>

391
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:33,280
them and there are a couple of certs

392
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:38,799
which were defeated with the with this

393
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:42,899
data and they try to reach the users of

394
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,900
the of the IP addresses

395
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,760
hi a range<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a speaking um well</font>

396
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:04,200
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk how do the</font>

397
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,129
manufacturers of the devices in

398
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:11,340
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> seagate for instance or lousy</font>

399
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:13,920
react on let's say the design flows did

400
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:20,330
you approach them and do they respond to

401
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:25,260
it to tell the<font color="#CCCCCC"> truth not directly but</font>

402
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:28,889
usually they tries to fixed it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

403
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">text and too well I would guess it might</font>

404
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:33,420
be a learning curve for them as well so

405
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,939
for the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendors it might be</font>

406
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,770
lots a common sense but for the

407
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,280
producers I don't know whether they are

408
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:43,310
already let's say into this stage of

409
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:46,290
handling let's say these floors in a

410
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:53,580
while strategic or that's a continuous

411
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:58,440
manner yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think to create a very</font>

412
00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:01,949
sophisticated way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage users</font>

413
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes it's too it's too professional</font>

414
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:07,860
for home users I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> many cases they</font>

415
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:13,170
just use the easiest way putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

416
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:15,979
together and and use the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cat simples</font>

417
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:20,280
the easiest way to to to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it along</font>

418
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:23,190
bring it alive and and create something

419
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:26,700
which is quite fancy and and just

420
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:29,810
working and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to care about how I wit</font>

421
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,810
sir could be abused

422
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:45,700
did you see any ftp servers which allow

423
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:51,670
uploading files but not allowing access

424
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:59,260
to them by anybody but the owner thank

425
00:26:51,670 --> 00:27:03,880
you so allowed to upload the file but

426
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:08,800
not alone to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> loan there are many</font>

427
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:11,530
servers I think maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pawnee ports or</font>

428
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,770
something which lets you write these but
