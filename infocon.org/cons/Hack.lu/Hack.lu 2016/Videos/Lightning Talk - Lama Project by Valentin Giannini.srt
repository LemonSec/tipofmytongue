00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,940
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming I'm a</font>

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:16,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">Valentine Janie I'm going to present to</font>

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:19,660
my project<font color="#E5E5E5"> llama project so I'm I like</font>

4
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:24,189
coding and all security things and I'm a

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:27,939
computer science engineer since one

6
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:31,740
month from telecom<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nancy and I made this</font>

7
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:35,940
project during my internship at<font color="#CCCCCC"> post and</font>

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:40,570
no I'm a security consultant at telecom

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,959
axiom services so let's start it with

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:47,320
the scenario if you are if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,520
big society you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be our search</font>

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,490
pattern you can analyze a fight and when

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a USB key or email with</font>

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:03,220
attachment you give it to to search and

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:11,350
ill analyze it and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say it's a</font>

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:14,920
ocular not but in the in often case you

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:19,329
just plug in the USB key or<font color="#CCCCCC"> open gmail</font>

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you are infected so now we can</font>

19
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:27,309
introduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lama project is a lab for</font>

20
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:33,130
automating<font color="#CCCCCC"> merwe analysis with a much</font>

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:37,270
faster on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tom IT than the when search so</font>

22
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:39,548
you can install it on your society it's

23
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:46,539
a platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> weapon in the bitten it</font>

24
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:49,329
combines tools and automate them you can

25
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:54,549
create your own module like to see might

26
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:58,889
files so you can send your file to the

27
00:01:54,549 --> 00:02:03,420
platform like a CLI Web API mail and etc

28
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:07,090
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> analiza face with a platformer</font>

29
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:11,910
software like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kaku Yama</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> early tools p</font>

30
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:16,790
PDF and so on and where is a

31
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:21,300
module<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 report urinal is analyzed and</font>

32
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:24,209
he has a cute logo so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">architecture of the platform you have</font>

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:32,060
the input part where I you send you your

35
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:36,079
file then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dispatcher the dispatcher</font>

36
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:41,940
collect your files and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent to all</font>

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:45,200
analysis module and always parts are

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:53,579
connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ftp server and database</font>

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:58,489
server so just little demo this is the

40
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:05,420
web interface you can see here fiber i

41
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:09,840
uploaded and from a plasma and module

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:15,529
when Eliza Ozzy file yeah it's a kickoff

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:19,140
for example after we have a llamar and

44
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:28,640
was up to like all the tools you can

45
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:31,859
analyze a word or excel files and when

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:37,440
when the null<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eliza can extract a file</font>

47
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:40,140
from your initial files is it's a recent

48
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the dispatcher to be analyzed again</font>

49
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:52,170
and all the extracted files are also

50
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:58,950
analyzed so you can see some module were

51
00:03:52,170 --> 00:04:01,980
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet and the platform</font>

52
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:11,820
computer scar who say it's if it's a

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:15,000
maybe a malware or not and etc there is

54
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">many thing to continue on the platform</font>

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,530
like improve a fire detection like a

56
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,400
support of polyglot files we can improve

57
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,580
analysis

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,948
width limit the death of the analyzer

59
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:42,090
cycle and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> check if the file is</font>

60
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:56,010
already analyzed all night now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

61
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:57,989
not a good slide it's also possible to

62
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,460
improve the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web view because it's not</font>

63
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:05,430
really responsive<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the moment and you</font>

64
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:11,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">can integrate other module like misp</font>

65
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:15,630
codex gigas why we r c ester day of PF

66
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:21,150
triage and there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Samberg to fix and</font>

67
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:24,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">an MoU so thank you and normally the</font>

68
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasoning with the depo don't wanna</font>

69
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,560
thank you
