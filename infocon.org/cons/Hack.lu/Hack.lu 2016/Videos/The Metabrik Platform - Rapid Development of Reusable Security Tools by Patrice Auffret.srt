1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:13,709
thank you so first thing thank you for

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:19,320
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> there this morning because it's</font>

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:21,060
not so really late chocolate so thank

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,520
you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those being in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there in the room</font>

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,860
yet we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about metallic platform</font>

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,759
which basically is used to quickly

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:36,780
develop the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools you you want and my</font>

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:42,410
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to to make you think it's rigged</font>

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:46,289
cool and we will want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so am i</font>

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,510
I've known under the undergo more my man

11
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security engineer for 15</font>

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,748
years now and pearl developer for the

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,730
same amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time I said the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

14
00:00:54,749 --> 00:01:02,940
it's / not Tyson I'm a sipping hot or

15
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:07,140
for various / models in 15 years I did

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,240
some some models of course Ned packet

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,030
maybe some people used it in the past

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,649
it's module to easily craft<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">packets to inject them on the network</font>

20
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:21,990
and get responses it's a sort of sketchy

21
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:25,500
infer but it was quite complex to use so

22
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,320
I rewrote it to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it even simpler</font>

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,090
and more modular and it's now the net

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,419
frame suit there is also the net right

25
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,250
module which is used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> loosen packet at</font>

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,049
various layers if you want to inject

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,539
that gets a clayr to a clear three what

28
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,939
layer for under network but that are the

29
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:47,280
subject of today's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will skip on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

30
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,869
presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> also already in the past in</font>

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,670
fp3 which is always operating a an

32
00:01:51,869 --> 00:02:00,600
operating system fingerprinting

33
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Institute yes it was back in 2012 but</font>

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,070
today it's about mental break so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,410
metaphoric apart subjective today it's

36
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:14,100
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Pokemon even though there is a</font>

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,810
pokemon card at least in french vanilla

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:21,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">i found it after</font>

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:24,950
besides the name of the tool but it's a

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a platform and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much more I</font>

41
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:34,079
emerged 33 features in enmity brick the

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:39,390
first one is to have a unix-like shell

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:44,310
and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use on a shell</font>

44
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:49,429
replacement on your daily stuff a true

45
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,430
language with a read eval print loop

46
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:56,250
Python developers are used to such read

47
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,519
eval print loop but not in power

48
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,170
committee so that's why I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

49
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:08,099
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> also and of course many bricks</font>

50
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:10,518
which helps you finally to quickly

51
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,760
develop a prototype some new tools

52
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:18,120
because in my experience there is a you

53
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,750
you need something quick and now so you

54
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">have two from the good tools to do it so</font>

55
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,940
true language I said it I said the word

56
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,010
it's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> in perl there are many</font>

57
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons to use pear mobile for me the</font>

58
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,298
primaries that this is a wedge I master

59
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:39,000
so I'm using / and yes the picture yeah

60
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:44,850
it should give you the wheel to use /

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,569
and why did I develop meta brick and I'm

62
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,480
a CLI lover I want to be able to do

63
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,339
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the command line so I</font>

64
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,750
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to make all the things</font>

65
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:00,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the command line and I also started</font>

66
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,090
to to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the do it once pretty super</font>

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,358
because I was tired of always writing

68
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,340
some throwaway script to do something

69
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the next time I wanted to do the</font>

70
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,389
same stuff I didn't find the script<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

71
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,200
wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> here sir well I was tired of doing</font>

72
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:22,280
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again the same stuff so I</font>

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,280
developed metaphorical so for that

74
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:32,039
regarding unix shells I found the pipe

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:37,460
too limited for my needs and that's why

76
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:40,560
I I thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new mechanism to to</font>

77
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,169
make bricks we will see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a few</font>

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,449
slides and for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I needed the</font>

79
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:51,299
powerful language<font color="#CCCCCC"> pearly's is a powerful</font>

80
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:53,819
language so it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it allows you to</font>

81
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,879
rapidly developed a new tool directly

82
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:58,289
from the command line you write our code

83
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,500
directly on the command line and water

84
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:04,860
as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can finally write</font>

85
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,419
scripts so you don't have to type again

86
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,560
again it with same commands in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell</font>

87
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:12,359
and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> a normalized some tax</font>

88
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,960
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you are like me</font>

89
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:20,520
but every tool as its own usage rules

90
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:25,370
its own flags sometimes quite cryptic

91
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:31,229
and I wanted something you easily

92
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:34,650
readable by human there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another tool</font>

93
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:37,050
which came up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meter</font>

94
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,960
brick which is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> webos it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

95
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:43,349
presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> at French security conference</font>

96
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:47,150
in the past and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal was exactly the</font>

97
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:50,400
same normalized tool usage but for Revis

98
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:53,580
the goal was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to automate interaction</font>

99
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,120
between tools and metallic I didn't want

100
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,250
to automate<font color="#CCCCCC"> so interaction between tools</font>

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:04,830
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to let the human decide</font>

102
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:08,669
on what he wants to do and reduce is not

103
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,310
a shell and again its usage is not so

104
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,710
easy so we are with some cryptic

105
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:18,539
agreements to pass you have to to really

106
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:20,310
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it works to use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

107
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:25,710
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> both are wrappers around</font>

108
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:29,460
existing tools and metallic is not only

109
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:32,489
rapper about this into there is some own

110
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,638
development within meta brick and it's

111
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,729
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I right brick i tried to use the</font>

112
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,089
best cpanel

113
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:42,308
because for those familiar with Japan

114
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:44,770
you may have multiple modules doing the

115
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:48,400
same thing so you have to test which one

116
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,889
is the best and so I did it each time I

117
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,448
ever to break so i don't have to to

118
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:58,479
check again which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the best expander</font>

119
00:06:54,449 --> 00:07:01,749
time for the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo I will show you</font>

120
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:06,669
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the shell with three kinds of</font>

121
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:09,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">comment lines you can like any unique</font>

122
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:12,460
shell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can call any external memory</font>

123
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:14,620
program you can call specific bricks

124
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">conan's this is where you have some</font>

125
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,839
specific metallic stuff and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

126
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:24,430
it's a parallel interpreter so you can

127
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:27,099
directly type some paracord and using

128
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,770
the bricks is as easy as knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

129
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:33,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">cannons use set yet children and help</font>

130
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:37,299
used to load the brake set to set some

131
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:39,639
property on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> brick get to to have</font>

132
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">information on values for properties and</font>

133
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,520
run to execute the command and help of

134
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:50,770
course to have some help so first of all

135
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">I recorded videos because I'm always I</font>

136
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:57,279
always forgive what I want to do when I

137
00:07:52,839 --> 00:08:00,729
ain't wit life so first thing you learn

138
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:03,759
the meta brick shell it loads a bunch of

139
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:07,748
bricks and this is bricks i'm using for

140
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,669
my work here you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's super</font>

141
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:13,569
interpreter so you just type some stuff

142
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:17,049
and I hear it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> a basic math and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

143
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:20,139
can define some variables pearl<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hara</font>

144
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,699
here and it outputs you can see the

145
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:27,330
content of a variable easily by just

146
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:27,330
naming it you can do it for hash is also

147
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,560
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you done the content easily so you</font>

148
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:39,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">can explore structure and now I want to</font>

149
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">use a power module to to do some stuff I</font>

150
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:43,179
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check my network interface for</font>

151
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:47,800
instance so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lo the module i</font>

152
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:49,359
instantiate the object here it does the

153
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,319
content of the object<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kilometer</font>

154
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">donate we</font>

155
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,720
that's basically a Perl interpreter and

156
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:05,430
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's so she'll</font>

157
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:09,660
so you can change<font color="#CCCCCC"> to another directory</font>

158
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:13,750
lists what you have as you can see here

159
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:17,469
the output of LS command is translated

160
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:22,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a pearl harbor directly because in</font>

161
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:24,570
fact LS here is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> areas and it's an</font>

162
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,780
early as for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell come on brick</font>

163
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:31,150
capture method or capture command so if

164
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,810
i run that it's exactly the same well

165
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,790
that's an ally yes and the output of a

166
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:41,920
run command is automatically saved in

167
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:45,699
the dollar run viable<font color="#CCCCCC"> add at the end of</font>

168
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,160
the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's super RS so you</font>

169
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,980
can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> call if you want to get you the</font>

last file of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iranian you just call</font>

171
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:58,350
it if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into how many files</font>

172
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,349
you have well just a matter of a partner

173
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:05,110
yes so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what you can</font>

174
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,609
do with checkin on this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rubric to</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wood and yes now I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

178
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:19,839
automate to automatically use to do for

179
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:22,810
my next clans so I set<font color="#CCCCCC"> free beauties to</font>

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,120
value and can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Angie sometimes get it</font>

184
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,430
is the same it's automatically set to

185
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,400
value attribute so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll call LS</font>

186
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,969
again and it automatically calls to do

187
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,640
and you will put<font color="#E5E5E5"> his head in you your</font>

188
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,980
user session so we don't have root

189
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,510
privileges anymore here and you can play

190
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:54,370
with your puter second answer that's

191
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:58,630
very handy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that was for a series of</font>

192
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:01,240
shell features most notable ones and you

193
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,270
have the britons in CD yes you can

194
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">customize the shell with</font>

195
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:11,730
metallic RC file you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a story online</font>

196
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,960
it's like a unix shell you have

197
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:18,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit lights and textures in it and</font>

198
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,670
completion for a commands for files for

199
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,610
variables for brick names you have

200
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,069
completion everywhere so we you tips you

201
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:29,280
have to type<font color="#CCCCCC"> some minimum of characters</font>

202
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:31,740
to use it and because it is using the

203
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,170
new liberate line you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,760
control key<font color="#CCCCCC"> GI control air to to search</font>

205
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:42,329
for the history what is a brick so I

206
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:46,110
said it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's wrappers around external</font>

207
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:49,350
programs but not only but a brick is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

208
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,850
an object and is defined by a set of

209
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:56,130
properties like tags category or

210
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,780
attributes and because its object

211
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,050
oriented a brick may inherit some

212
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:03,600
property from another one so it's easy

213
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,449
to write a new brick which looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

214
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,090
existing one for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file psv</font>

215
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:13,830
brick is able to endure pipe separated

216
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:16,190
values and judging a rich from the files

217
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:20,580
esv you just change the separator

218
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:23,520
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of chromoly to pipe you can add</font>

219
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,700
features to existing tools because in my

220
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,730
in my experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool I'm using</font>

221
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,950
always like seven feature and it may not

222
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,340
be easy sometimes to add the<font color="#CCCCCC"> feature so</font>

223
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:38,850
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy external growth and some</font>

224
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,370
fishes for instance in scalpel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

225
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,970
speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> later a five-time regarding</font>

226
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:47,760
scamper in the end the brick is reusable

227
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:50,010
per module you can use from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the command</font>

228
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,439
line interface or<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pensacola</font>

230
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:02,340
the brick tool is something which helps

231
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:04,740
use meta brick because Rick depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

232
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:08,520
external programs or perl modules and

233
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:11,010
Rick tool make that really easy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

234
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,110
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Renwick and</font>

235
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,880
style command on the brick you want to

236
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,040
use and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will install all the</font>

237
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,860
dependencies for a severe search

238
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,430
you will even fetch the github

239
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,589
repository could buy files where it

240
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,269
needs well everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is done under the</font>

241
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,910
hood for you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to care</font>

242
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:32,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that then you use the brake and</font>

243
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:36,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">hip help and it says what you can do is</font>

244
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:39,120
it the meta brick itself is updated

245
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,339
really on a daily basis and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font>

246
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,389
brick to update command so you can be

247
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:48,660
always up to date on it there are some

248
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:51,810
special variables we have seen some of

249
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,630
them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll skip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide now the</font>

250
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">demo2 i will show you if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have time at</font>

251
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,199
the end this<font color="#CCCCCC"> time is running meta brick</font>

252
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,449
is composed of two main components

253
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:06,959
submit a brick core and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metal brick</font>

254
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:09,870
repository the metallic core is made on

255
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">a base class so meta brick base class</font>

256
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:16,380
and four bricks call global core shell

257
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">croagh and core context in fact every</font>

258
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,000
command you type goes through the core

259
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:24,000
of modules so you can trust every action

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,040
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> emit a brick and you can replace</font>

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,100
the color blue by you own one if you

262
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,810
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> Korra context is where everything</font>

263
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,399
is catching memory for instance

264
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,790
variables you have defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your shell</font>

265
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,889
well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't suggest you to look at the</font>

266
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:43,889
code for context because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sumter</font>

267
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:45,930
magic and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes may bleed the meta</font>

268
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:48,089
requires minimal system and perl modules

269
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,760
dependencies to make it easy to

270
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:53,639
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> and meet a brick repository</font>

271
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,430
where is most<font color="#CCCCCC"> obscene interesting reeks</font>

272
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,010
of course is a separate module<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tunstall</font>

273
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,109
with nearly no dependencies at all

274
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:05,040
because dependencies are honored with

275
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:08,870
brick table has<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've shown you just</font>

276
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:14,120
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more than 200 bricks and</font>

277
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:14,120
regularly create new bricks so

278
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,120
with symmetric bricks you may say that

279
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">how do i find rubric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to use for</font>

280
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">my work that's why bricks are attacked</font>

281
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,560
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use a brick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> search brick to</font>

282
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:32,490
to search what you want to do for

<font color="#E5E5E5">instance if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i run research tab video it</font>

284
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,950
ends up with some bricks related to

285
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:41,220
video and the demo I the gym oh I

286
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,860
recorded was recorded thanks to a brick

287
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:47,220
so i don't have to remember how to

288
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:51,150
record my my desktop again a grid tool

289
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:54,060
you can also help<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to create a new</font>

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">brick you just call the cred recommend</font>

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,400
and you have a skeleton of a new brick

292
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:02,160
so that's really handy and create tool

293
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:06,900
to create ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> return of a new purse quit</font>

294
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:12,810
if I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> screen emo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay at least</font>

295
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:15,329
one here you can see at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top from the</font>

296
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:19,079
shell you use a break and you call a

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> gram thanks to the create tool it</font>

300
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:31,350
will just create the skeleton ear to to

301
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,600
load the core contacts module and after

302
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:42,570
that you have to use the module<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Alan</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">gusta so demo switch here I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

304
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,670
able to analyze them aware but i am not

306
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,560
take a screenshot of a virtual machine

307
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:56,450
before the execution of the malware and

308
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:00,439
after and performative and what happened

309
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:03,600
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that i have to use multiple rigs</font>

310
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,290
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system virtual box so i can</font>

311
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,520
automate interaction with virtualbox and

312
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:13,020
some others are removed Winx<font color="#E5E5E5"> E&W am I to</font>

313
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,959
execute commands remotely on Windows

314
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,709
machine or to fetch some attributes and

315
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:23,030
in the end I want also to use volatility

316
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,030
to perform different our memory

317
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so first thing to do I want to do</font>

318
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,390
look to stop my virtual machine so I

319
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,020
call the least amount as you can see

320
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,090
everything in meta brick is outputted as

321
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,730
a pair of I others you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like</font>

322
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">likely / viable I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

323
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,370
windows 7 machine I guess the Ritz IG I

324
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:56,070
verify it is started and yes it's

325
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,709
already started not just to check every

326
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:02,879
start it again Matt well okay it says

327
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:07,350
it's already started so no for so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

328
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:11,070
execute a command to test it works here

329
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:16,049
same GXE so it gives me a shell to the

330
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:20,760
windows machine perfect it works in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

331
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:23,070
example I will I will execute calc don't

332
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,870
exist as a malware it's just a proof of

333
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:30,120
concept here so get wind from the

334
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,479
process is a debris on master so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

335
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,689
searching everything if its larger than

336
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,679
the streak the screen is outputted to

337
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:45,360
less so you can such suffer the reason

338
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:55,350
it's a cool feature so now execute

339
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:58,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">calculated Z ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I such again and it</font>

340
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,120
failed yeah because I didn't call the

341
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:03,929
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good method I have to execute it in</font>

348
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,650
in virtualbox you conduct the content of

the memory here as you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

350
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,960
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to use it so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just used a</font>

351

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,860
it gives me some

353
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:40,720
help on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a lubricant so I</font>

354
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:44,020
don't the vm memory so in a virtual box

355
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,880
it's an e LF<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phi which is outputted then</font>

356
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,090
you have to extract just the memory part

357
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,950
from the LF five so there is another

358
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:56,980
cannon to just extract that information

359
00:19:50,950 --> 00:20:00,880
and now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a file volatility can</font>

360
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,700
read and you call a fierce list command

361
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,150
for the big volatility and the dollar

362
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:14,530
run because it has been saved in the

363
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:16,870
last command and you should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

364
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,450
sell for<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet eggsy okay so you're it</font>

365
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:23,320
so you can see it's again a third

366
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:27,370
variable which is outputted here so not

367
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,730
that great now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I used some rigs to do</font>

368
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:33,159
some separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> more jobs but this is</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to tonight and I can</font>

370
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:39,010
simply write a new brick which will you

help on the on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> break so you can see</font>

382
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:26,380
you have a bunch of clans available here

00:21:52,630 --> 00:22:00,640
to be in in a good state so I rest of

395
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,470
the vm first I ping it i'm waiting in

396

tools directory up<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the vm beings such</font>

402

great ok so i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute i will first</font>

403
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,140
upload netcat here the malware is just

404
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:32,199
netcat i will upload net cut to the

405
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:36,010

00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:42,129
uploaded<font color="#CCCCCC"> i take a snapshot of the vm</font>

408
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,820
before execution of the malware so it's

409
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:48,240
temp in the vm core extracting the

410
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,240
member

411
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:57,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I save the file name for later</font>

412
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:01,680
use because you want a gift so we'll

413
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:05,760
have to use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again now I execute</font>

414
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:09,010
some malware this commander is not

415
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,910
simple enough I have to to simplify it

416
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:15,070
by default<font color="#CCCCCC"> the files uploaded to the CU</font>

417
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,440
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard directory so I call it</font>

418
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,620
share I will just do a connection to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

419
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,690
my website<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this time it's calling</font>

420
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,629
the execute in background<font color="#CCCCCC"> come on so as</font>

421
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:29,230
a present for<font color="#E5E5E5"> him I take the snapshot</font>

422
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:33,700
after executing the malware so again

423
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:39,010
dumping the vm core<font color="#CCCCCC"> extractions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> memory</font>

424
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:41,820
damp and in the end we have the steak

425
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:45,310
before and after execution of the manga

426
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:49,950
so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what has changed</font>

427
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,950
regarding processes between these two

428
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:57,730
these two run so I perform process diff

429
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:01,930
against before and after so on it's

430
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:06,880
calling the volatility PS list command

431
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:10,110
again so what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see i have a few new</font>

432
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,940
processes i have my net category cmd.exe

433
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:15,300
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the result so avg so i</font>

434
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,460
should have turned off my antivirus

435
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:23,050
because it is bugging me and on the

436
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:25,090
result but one and that cat is probably

437
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:30,669
calling condos<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not very familiar</font>

438
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:34,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">with can host</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XE so i can i save the</font>

439
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:36,610
output for it to use and now i want to

440
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next a gift to see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there has been</font>

441
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,530
some network connection made from from

442
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,050
this malware so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same</font>

443
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:46,050
so same stuff from Ned stop thief

444
00:24:51,780 --> 00:25:01,450
so you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boot here you have three</font>

445
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:05,590
connections one of them is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> game g avg</font>

446
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:08,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a VG so it is</font>

447
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:10,600
bugging me but anyway you seen that cat

448
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,129
is connected to an IP address so yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

449
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,520
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a new</font>

450
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:22,110
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the from the malware so</font>

451
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:28,270
again I've save that for later used<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

452
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:31,840
so it was a remote wind if so that's

453
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:35,590
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote a new tool with with</font>

454
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,030
existing rexburg I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user and there is</font>

455
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,970
some feature which is lacking so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

456
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,379
to to do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more stuff for instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

457
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,970
want to save the output associate this

458
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,610
file that thread there is a there is a

459
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,230
brick which existed exactly for that so

460
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,600
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go run five Cs we write</font>

461
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,000
dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> process diff out but she's in</font>

462
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,560
yourself you would put in a CSV file you

463
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,210
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a reverse lookup on the IP</font>

464
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:59,260
address you will also have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for</font>

465
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:03,070
that you want to use the virus total<font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font>

466
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:06,340
to check if this IP address is Melissa

467
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,020
or not so you use a very subtle API same

468
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,720
with showdown if you want to give some

469
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:13,540
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two and</font>

470
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,090
red bricks so chances are if you want to

471
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:21,790
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a brick which at</font>

472
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:25,240
least can help you do that some of the

473
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:27,780
best bricks and the API category I'm ass

474
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,250
plank user so i have an API to

475
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,820
interrogate sprang it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not complete</font>

476
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:36,160
because spenc fe<font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite huge and you</font>

477
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,340
have a client elasticsearch because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font>

478
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,760
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an elastic star cluster so i want</font>

479
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:46,780
to to check the state of mashhad all of

480
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,360
that stuff so I wrote it here mongodb

481
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:52,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">reedus rest if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to interrogate</font>

482
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,639
an API<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest client is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always useful</font>

483
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,080
you want to automate ssf stuff so you

484
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,810
have a client SSH Twitter you maybe you

485
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,260
want to arrest server there is a rest of

486
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,379
us so you can

487
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,060
weaponize a brick by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colleen a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

rest api and gives you the output as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

496
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,260
many many bricks in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network category</font>

497
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,930
to you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass the output of anlap</font>

498
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,720
you should use network and the bricks

499
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:38,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">boot is already already parsed and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

500
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:43,130
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the scene mp3 which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

501
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:44,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">OS fingerprinting too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i developed and it</font>

502
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,640
was quite complicated to understand but

503
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:49,159
because now there is a break it's just

504
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,300
run Rick to Landstuhl networks in fp3

505
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:59,810
you can play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it so it makes things</font>

506
00:27:53,300 --> 00:28:04,220
really simple conclusion more than 200

507
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:07,129
bricks every tool in fact becomes /

508
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:10,100
viable in<font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX everything is a file in</font>

509
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:12,080
meta brick everything is available<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

510
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:15,530
can alternate really<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the things from</font>

511
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:20,659
scott line you can add missing features

512
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:23,450
to existing tools because the true usage

513
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:26,060
is normalized it helps you reuse a tool

514
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:30,350
I brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rick maybe one year ago</font>

515
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:34,790
and during one year I didn't use it and

516
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:38,540
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again and well I could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

517
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:41,389
the thing I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use with no no</font>

518
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:44,450
attack directly is really it helps

519
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:48,890
reusability<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a shell unification of</font>

520
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:51,890
the sequel it has it shell<font color="#E5E5E5"> readies as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

521
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:54,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">should its shell many tools are their</font>

522
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:59,540
own shell and here you have the same

523
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:03,740
shell for any tools for<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes who would be</font>

524
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:10,060
interested in in a workshop if I did do

525
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:13,430
a workshop on meta brick yeah few people

526
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if i have a few</font>

527
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,440
minutes left maybe if i can do the demo

528
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,580
or

529
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:24,540
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i will go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the scalp</font>

530
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:29,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">l stuff yes scalpel so is a forensic</font>

531
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:33,960
tool to carve some files from from

532
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:39,149
binary data and for me it lacked two

533
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,710
features to easily generate the

534
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,480
configuration file because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to</font>

535
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is to generate the configuration file</font>

536
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,040
to say how to extract which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

537
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:53,100
and the second one is that it extracts

538
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:55,379
styles with without checking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 90 part</font>

539
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,649
of magic tip so you have to do it after

540
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:02,370
extraction to verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 58 x factor's</font>

541
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:06,030
is really what you wanted to extract so

542
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:08,939
was it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use the challenge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root me</font>

543
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:11,700
challenge the ID is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a some bad guy</font>

544
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,310
kidnapped your cat and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you found some</font>

545
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:18,770
some device on the crime scene and you

546
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:22,710
have to cover that two together together

547
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:25,530
information I know and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end find</font>

548
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:28,800
you cut your missing cat and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font>

549
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a few brick facade so silly</font>

550
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,980
more

551
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:46,610
so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Challenger in French is named</font>

552
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:51,439
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Volusia find the gut you have two</font>

553
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:53,659
files so because LS is captured you you

554
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,230
do a lesson save the files for later use

555
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:59,710
you will use a file type break to check

556
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:04,630
for mine and magic types of the file you

557
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:08,780
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ashraf with so this is a zip file</font>

558
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay mime type again so okay I have to</font>

559
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,470
go and compress this file of course

560
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,880
because it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really I'll</font>

561
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:17,270
confess<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine so you called in contrast</font>

562
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,120
come on whatever the compression method

563
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:22,070
used that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your problem the brick</font>

564
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,570
we take care of that it will in fact

565
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:27,820
check for the main typing<font color="#CCCCCC"> culture</font>

566
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">curriculum to just n compress the file</font>

567
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:48,430
ok finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> compressed I sweet for you to</font>

568
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:48,430
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

569
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:59,690
69 types again so this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have what</font>

570
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:03,570
looks like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system it's a</font>

571
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:07,530
partition so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good candidate for</font>

572
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:09,360
a file carving you look the Brig well

573
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,730
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a neuroma stage because</font>

574
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,550
it's already loaded and you want to

575
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:17,250
generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a configuration file to extract</font>

576
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,780
some kind of files because I know the

577
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,840
result of the challenge I will just

578
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,670
generate a configuration file to extract

579
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,669
OpenOffice document so the file a

580
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:32,160
generator now i can call scalpel scan

581
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:34,890
come on to find the files<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and here</font>

582
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,750
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see you have two tributes one is</font>

583
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:40,470
unverified files and the other one is

584
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:45,000
verified Phibes very fine means this is

585
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:46,950
truly OpenOffice document so so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

586
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,710
know the result of the challenge so I go

587
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:55,050
directly to the to the good file<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

588
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,910
the magic tips it's not really useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

589
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,669
hear that well just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the demo it's</font>

590
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:03,420
really an OpenOffice document open

591
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:05,760
document text to me again you have to

592
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,320
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can uncompressed such kind</font>

593
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,210
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> document so you just call again Jeff</font>

594
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll confess and confess come on Donna</font>

595
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:16,080
on the file and I know the result is in

596
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:20,810
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gpg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> face when getting that yes</font>

597
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,909
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my cat I know him I have seen it</font>

598
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:26,790
it's a JPG file so you want to extract

599
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:30,660
the meta data so you you could get meta

600
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:36,960
data on it and you have some GPS

601
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:44,270
coordinate one just here so your phone

602
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:47,430
your phone your cat so it was easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

603
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:52,080
conclusion um I do have some times or

604
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,880
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can show you some source</font>

605
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,370
code

606
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:01,370
oh wow okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will just show</font>

607
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:05,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">you the source code of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trick I hope</font>

608
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:08,569
it's readable / any what you will say so

609
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:11,719
the remote wind if inherits<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

610
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,940
client s<font color="#E5E5E5"> my client brick so you can</font>

611
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:16,100
upload files download files from the

612
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:20,780
remote machine so a brick is defined

613
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:24,889
with a set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> properties like attributes</font>

614
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:26,690
to set user name password so volatility

615
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:28,970
profile here you can define default

616
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">values for attributes of course windows</font>

617
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:34,580
7 sp1 is a good choice for volatility

618
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:37,159
you have the commands in fact this

619
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:41,719
defines the help here you have how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

620
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:44,780
use the arguments and required modules

621
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:48,138
here you will cry out for other bricks

622
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">to to write so upload because you</font>

623
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:52,280
inherit from a Simba client you just

624
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:55,220
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause you upload all the staff</font>

625
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have argument checking in each</font>

626
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:00,589
command so you have always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same kind</font>

627
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,350
of error messages so that's under your

628
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:06,680
so to understand what happens I want to

629
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:10,100
execute<font color="#CCCCCC"> the command so I i instantiate</font>

630

the remote Winx<font color="#CCCCCC"> e-brake and set is</font>

631

00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:22,400
out the vmx same stuff you see it

634
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:25,910
started in headless mode you take a

635
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,130
snapshot on the vm so instantiates

636
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:32,600
system that works again you called adam

637
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:35,990
khor<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own link is also done in the</font>

638
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">same way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for every command and so when</font>

639
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,490
you use it you just call<font color="#CCCCCC"> the command and</font>

640
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,680
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> return and you will have your</font>

641
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,569
messages and execution will stop if

642
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,569
there is an error so you don't have to

643
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:49,430
to take care of heroin linked by by

644
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:53,990
yourself when you are using some

645
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:56,600
existing breaks so the process diff ok

646
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,759
you can you call up a list on the first

647
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,290
snapshot and a list on the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

648
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,829
and you perform a thief on to power

649
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:11,209

651
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:21,420
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's so code is available</font>

652
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:24,089
on the track meta brick you have some

653
