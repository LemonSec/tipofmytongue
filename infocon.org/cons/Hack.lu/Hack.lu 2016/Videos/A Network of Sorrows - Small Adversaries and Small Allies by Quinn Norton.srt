00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,789
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning I'm a little shaky I</font>

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,750
spent a little too much time and energy

4
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:19,220
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaker's dinner last night so</font>

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:22,369
bear with me if I have to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> for water</font>

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,130
a few times so um I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be talking to you</font>

7
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:26,570
today about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of the internet or</font>

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,499
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am calling it the network of</font>

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,090
sorrows and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Shakespeare</font>

10
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:33,589
really does help us understand the

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,090
technical underpinnings of our current

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,280
internet when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> says when sorrows come</font>

they not they come not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as single spies</font>

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">but in battalions so let's go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

15
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:45,260
the to the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> or closer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,410
beginning of the internet it starts as a

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,420
simple system very academic and in this

18
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,148
world the security model of the internet

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,899
was when someone did something bad you

20
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:58,250
called their<font color="#CCCCCC"> adviser and yelled at them</font>

21
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:02,809
we're still working with the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so when our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first worm</font>

hit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Morris worm this is the picture</font>

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,410

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,790
even though it<font color="#E5E5E5"> became in the US the</font>

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,180
basically just call someone's invite

00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:23,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">adviser and yell and that's kind of all</font>

the predictions for this year from some

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:57,810
analysis is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll hit 75 billion in</font>

67
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,190
some some estimates say that the loss

68
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,720
globally could be well over a trillion

69
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,940
this year but it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say what a</font>

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,829
real number is because in many ways

71
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,980
these figures can't touch the real cost

72
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:14,519
of insecurity on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet the cost</font>

privacy trade away the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lost Time worry</font>

75
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,500
the myriads of tiny personal tragedies

76
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,690
that will never hear about I have to say

77
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,910
when I was looking for this I was

78
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for a webcam picture of someone</font>

85
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,048
this year now the reason why I think

86
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:49,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to point out the</font>

American figures here is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also a</font>

88
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,060
national system where as of last year

89
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:58,798
half of all students in you in US public

90
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,480
schools qualify for poverty assistance

91
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,950
those are the people paying these ransom

92
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">where's and it's hard to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a real</font>

93
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,649
figure because most schools are hiding

94
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,480
this when it happens one survey i was

95
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,669
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it showed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> half of</font>

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,369
hospitals in that survey had been hit

97
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:18,220
with malware often multiple times how do

98
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">we quantify that kind of damage how do</font>

99
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">we quantify when duty nurses are too</font>

nervous and stressed out to get their

101
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:30,949
procedures correct quite right what is

102
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:37,259
the cost in that

103
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:38,969
in traditional stocking a traditional

104
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:43,139
stocking as we've known it this gets

105
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:44,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">really dark really fast and those are</font>

106
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,289
the figures for what we think of as

107
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,849
traditional stocking of course the

108
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:50,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> added a new layer to that</font>

109
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:52,110
but also nobody has solid figures yet

110
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:54,780
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure and how the internet is</font>

111
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,240
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> stocking except</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

112
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,849
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot easier weirdly possibly</font>

113
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,190
the biggest losers in that are men whose

114
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:08,330
rate of stocking is double online what

115
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:12,150
it is offline and this translates into a

116
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:15,180
lot of creepy moments that cross these

117
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,068
barriers on on what makes you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> safe</font>

118
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,930
in the world because<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens with</font>

computer insecurity what happens with

<font color="#E5E5E5">small adversaries is they tend to meet</font>

and amplify our basic human flaws and in

the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some of the most terrible</font>

the world whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call it spousal</font>

abuse in the West or honor killings in

127

in Pakistan or kids who<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't get kids</font>

filter filtration because of management

by families administrators schools

communities all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are part of</font>

134
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,180
the cost of small adversaries perhaps

135
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,819
the greatest and hardest to quantify

136
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,650
cost of our terrible terrible security

137
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:11,159
culture is the sense that so many people

138
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">have even the people in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:15,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have to fear the very thing that</font>

they must rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> for their lives and</font>

livelihood so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is obviously a very</font>

142
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,860
different landscape from most of what

we're seeing in the media and most of

what we're seeing in the media these

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,960
days especially post-snowden and some of

146
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,129
the so forth is this discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

147
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,049
super powerful actors right who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

148
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:40,050
spying on everyone but honestly not

149
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:43,169
doing that much and we're still looking

150
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,189
at this paradigm coming from

151
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:49,400
law enforcement and from like global

152
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:52,249
governmental conflict that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

153
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,229
talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things in terms of</font>

154
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:57,419
good guys and bad guys and discreet

155
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:59,430
criminals but treating adversaries on

156
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,590
the internet like<font color="#CCCCCC"> discreet criminals is</font>

157
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,039
ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's bringing a gun to a</font>

158
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:08,628
locust swarm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet will always</font>

159
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:12,509
make more<font color="#E5E5E5"> ass hats I promise you that</font>

160
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:14,310
the ass hats aren't endless and that

161
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:15,949
means essentially what we're doing in

162
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,129
security is threat modeling our

163
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:22,409
environment really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wrong so this</font>

164
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:24,300
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how clearly you can</font>

165
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,339
read this but it's somebody asking a

166
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,339
teenager why they're using snapchat and

167
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:30,779
we'll come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but this</font>

168
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">teenager is threat modeling very well</font>

169
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:35,819
because I believe it's a her bitch I

170
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:39,330
think she's saying yeah that that she

171
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:44,539
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care what governments do parents</font>

172
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:46,770
have always been the og big brother and

173
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:48,509
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one of the things at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

174
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,349
set that is really important is that we

175
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:56,580
live in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as above as below as above</font>

176
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:59,460
network that that what big guys do small

177
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,938
guys emulate and what small guys do big

178
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,520
guys pick up it's all traversing this

179
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,860
hierarchy as much more like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ecosystem</font>

180
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,719
than then we often think it is nobody

181
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">can really tell us who's acting for sure</font>

182
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:15,330
and something that say a big actor puts

183
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,039
out there the small actors can find they

184
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,680
can pick up they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it directly</font>

185
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,800
where they can emulate it I mean we're

186
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,930
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the first threat environment</font>

187
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,939
basically in history<font color="#E5E5E5"> where generally the</font>

188
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,330
things people throw at each other they

189
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,310
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pick up and use again now it's</font>

190
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,828
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first time like this is an idea</font>

191
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:39,478
that goes all the way back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rome</font>

192
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:40,708
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus Carthage when when Carthage was</font>

193
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,719
winning because they figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to</font>

194
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:45,569
put together all their ships like IKEA

195
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,339
flat packs and Rome caught one of them

196
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:49,519
and found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what the numbering system</font>

197
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,680
was for putting the ships together and

198
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,839
in a way what we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is we've taken</font>

199
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">that same threat model that we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken</font>

200
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,510
that same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and moved it into</font>

201
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,370
are infinitely replicating machines it's

202
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,290
not it's it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem that we</font>

203
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,959
have every on every desktop it's the

204
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:11,310
Carthaginian fleet being taken over by

205
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,810
the Romans but but in an environment

206
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,300
where everybody can pick up everybody's

207
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,569
tools we're all weirdly empowered now

208
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,329
and I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of weird in an almost</font>

209
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:26,310
face<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends like our powers are weird they</font>

210
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:28,979
make us weird and they make our our

211
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,869
conflicts weird it's again that idea

212
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our tools are interacting with our</font>

213
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,190
human flaws and really really

214
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,360
interesting ways and let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

215
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,040
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tools because we all know</font>

216
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,949
these tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> there remote administration</font>

217
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,660
tools the tools of small adversaries are

218
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,399
the same tools that we are recommending

219
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,500
to people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use against small</font>

223
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,420
updates to their machines and now

224
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:04,349
malware often looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a V and updates</font>

225
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:08,399
and everything everything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our fields</font>

226
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:11,339
is dual use everything that we can use

230
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:27,300
understanding of how are our tools are

231
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,649
working gets gets really confused this

232
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,420
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my favorite tweets</font>

234
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,599
for security reasons I can't give you

00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:37,410
ssh access of the box but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use</font>

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">fundamental misunderstanding it's a sign</font>

238
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:45,180
that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of lost the thread of</font>

239
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,010
how these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> are working we want to</font>

240
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,109
fix things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the most common complaint</font>

241
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,000
I hear are this disconnect between the

242
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,649
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can help and the</font>

243
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,190
actions that can implement that

244
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:58,589
information understanding a system and

245
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,680
then acting it on acting on it in a way

246
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,120
that creates change and<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are the</font>

247
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">places in which both naive and</font>

248
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,880
sophisticated users are disconnected at

249
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:11,400
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all really heavy</font>

250
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,140
stuff and I want you to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

251
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,720
and take a take a moment with a kitten

252
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,939
picture so we can stop thinking about

253
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,580
bad system administrators and people

254
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:27,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">being killed by their exes or we can</font>

keep I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know but I do want to</font>

256
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:32,850
emphasize in this that most people who

257
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,020
are working the fit most people who are

258
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:40,590
pulling a paycheck in this field are not

259
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,780
interacting with the pain that most

260
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:47,490
people are experiencing from network and

261
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:51,449
security because you end up working for

262
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:54,480
people who pay and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> high school but</font>

263
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,310
that was like a 1925 picture of my own

264
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,510
high school that high school can't

265
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:03,569
afford anyone in this room and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

266
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:06,270
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so much of this pain and</font>

267
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,880
insecurity in the world isn't readily

268
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:12,530
visible to the people who work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

269
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:17,100
field who are supposed to be fixing it

270
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:19,410
it's not entirely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you guys or on even</font>

271
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,130
the crappy<font color="#E5E5E5"> programmer programming that</font>

272
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:25,199
makes this happen in the world that so

273
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,860
much pain is caused by the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

274
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,750
days but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the fact that we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be part of the solution</font>

universe it's got a human attached to it

291
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,989
and they're not part of our security

292
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:22,260
models as a matter of fact we generally

293
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:25,170
see the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a liability but we're</font>

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:30,439
leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge amount of computational</font>

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,939
the viewer users should be the ones who

are advocating for the for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

299
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,599
world and they're not right now there's

300
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,490
a lot of conflict between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who</font>

303
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:52,860
that's ridiculous because you have the

same goals one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that that I</font>

305
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,329
I'm always baffled about is when we're

306
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going wrong</font>

307
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:02,099
with the system we're not asking the

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,320
happening on that system should there<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

310
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,880
a bunch of traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to IRC well I</font>

312
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,180
should be a bunch of traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

313
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:16,500
IRC on this box but no one has ever

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:18,899
asked me in any of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems no one</font>

has<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever kicked up something saying does</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this look right to you and yeah we'd</font>

317
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:26,279
have to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a language to do that but</font>

318
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:28,019
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> an amazing piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:35,370
asking the human if that's what they're

321
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:38,790
doing right now humans love to respond i

322
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,890
mean both as animals and as and as

323
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,269
employees they love to respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

324
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,189
restriction of system so one of the

325
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:47,190
things I've wondered in the past few

326
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,829
years is why we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take systems of</font>

327
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,000
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want exfiltrated and</font>

328
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:56,760
put them on narrow bandwidth connections

329
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,699
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> that get annoying if you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got like</font>

330
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:03,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">a giant patient database why not put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

331
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:05,279
on your network under a 56k connection

332
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,529
so if somebody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to pull it all</font>

333
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,720
someone's going to notice because

334
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,490
there's no reason when you have vast

335
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,860
amounts of people's personal data is

336
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,560
there is basically no reason to pull it

337
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:20,040
all at once if somebody's doing that it

338
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,920
should hurt the network and people can

339
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,959
respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that pain that's like one</font>

340
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,670
example I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think probably if we</font>

341
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,439
brainstormed enough we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could come up</font>

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples of ways in which</font>

343
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">people could respond</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font>

345
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,060
faster and easier than<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get the</font>

346
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,400
machines to respond

people have context<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can match</font>

348
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,699
patterns people know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a witch kitten</font>

349
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:48,770
is cute machines don't do that machines

350
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,180
are good at adding things we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

351
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,189
system that's good at pattern matching

352
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,479
and a system that's good at math and we

353
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,570
keep trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell humans to do more</font>

354
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,850
math and computers to do more pattern

355
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:03,920
matching that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we're missing a</font>

356
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:05,620
few opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and then one of</font>

357
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need more of</font>

358
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,960
between users and technicians in the

359
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,020
21st century is more respect and more

360
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,000
listening we spent a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time telling</font>

361
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,140
users they should listen to us but we

362
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,910
don't spend nearly as much time

363
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,520
listening to users and partly that's

364
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,730
because users don't normally speak the

365
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,319
languages of technicians but that

366
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't mean that they're not passing</font>

367
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:33,140
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> information even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in consumer choices</font>

368
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,880
users users are passing you a lot of

369
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,740
information if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these</font>

370
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,840
applications here applications and

371
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,450
behaviors they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve the</font>

372
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,890
same problems that security teams and

373
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,900
system measures are trying to solve

374
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,970
their they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

375
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,069
things like Dropbox to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from the</font>

376
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,860
problems of malicious attachments

377
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,170
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reclaim privacy with</font>

378
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,540
things like snapchat and and whatsapp

379
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,459
and I think that these behaviors on

380
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,500
their part are fantastic and should be

381
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,720
encouraged and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people will step</font>

382
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,240
in and go but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's all lies and</font>

383
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,890
there's all these other problems but

384
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,170
that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that that was the</font>

385
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,060
intention of the user the intention of

386
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,390
the user was to fix the systems that

387
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">they were in and that intention that's</font>

388
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:20,420
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means we're on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

389
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:23,329
side so if snapchat is lying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

390
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,370
users then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these lies</font>

391
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,730
and make them true in the famous words

392
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:31,729
of George Michael we need to take these

393
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:36,350
tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the places where the users are</font>

394
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:42,320
and help them understand what state

395
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:45,260
they're in at any<font color="#E5E5E5"> given time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we</font>

396
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,460
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Google Mail and part of the</font>

397
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,680
reason people went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Mail was</font>

398
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,120
because this shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not working for</font>

399
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">them because they're trying to solve</font>

400
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,110
their own problems and they

401
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,330
went to these very specific behaviors

402
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,810
like our 14 year old girl who went to

403
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:01,149
snapchat to avoid her parents like the

404
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,919
myriad of teenagers who have hopped from

405
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,230
social network to social network so that

406
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,290
they could describe a safe space for

407
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,630
themselves you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in an age</font>

408
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,629
where asshat marketers will tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us that</font>

409
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,830
that kids and people don't respect their

410
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,180
product that don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their</font>

411
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:20,260
privacy they'll trade it away for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

412
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:22,150
coupon but it's just not<font color="#CCCCCC"> true you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

413
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,950
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you remember being a</font>

414
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:26,350
teenager but teenagers are incredibly

415
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,270
privacy seeking how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you always</font>

416
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">were like cool with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your parents walking</font>

417
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,310
straight into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your room was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that cool I</font>

418
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,520
mean go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and like if it's totally</font>

419
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:39,460
cool raise your hand I'll point you out

420
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:42,550
but but for most of us we definitely

421
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:46,480
wanted every one of us has doors on our

422
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:48,100
bathrooms we all want privacy so why is

423
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,450
there a disconnect with the internet a

424
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,770
lot of it has to do with digital

425
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:54,010
literacy a lot of it has to do with

426
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,990
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and the fact is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

427
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,980
our tools to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us first and</font>

428
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:02,410
foremost while all of you have a door on

429
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,850
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> toilet all of you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a toilet</font>

430
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:09,580
without a door if you need to I promise

431
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,629
and that's why the things I want you to

432
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,240
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're talking about</font>

433
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,950
security stuff because in the end one of

434
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the conflicts that comes up over this</font>

435
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,670
one of the reasons why users are seen as

436
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,580
a point of its security is because

437
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the job done is more important</font>

438
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,889
than getting it done securely and that

439
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,870
will always<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in conflict you will</font>

440
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:36,070
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> be ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the door without</font>

441
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:37,780
a toilet if you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to so people</font>

442
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,909
are not stupid about their security in

443
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">their privacy but they've been lied to</font>

444
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:46,180
and that's part of the problem that we

445
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:50,200
as a community are in a position to to

446
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,910
help with to fix one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other things</font>

447
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">I one of the other things I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think gets</font>

448
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,010
disconnected between technicians of all

449
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,280
stripes and and the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are not</font>

450
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,720
in their fields is that we often<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

451
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,700
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen or don't care</font>

452
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,260
because we forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this isn't other</font>

453
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,810
people's jobs if you were

454
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,040
sitting in this room to some degree

455
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,679
people are paying you to use a long

456
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,530
password people are paying you to worry

457
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,140
about queue management if you are a

458
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,990
trash collector or a radiologist or a

459
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:23,380
lawyer this takes away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

460
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,850
day so honestly one of the reasons we

461
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,490
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good tools to where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

462
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,740
are is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a radiologist</font>

463
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't want your radiologist to learn</font>

464
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">pgp I promise you want your radiologist</font>

465
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,820
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at your frickin scans you want</font>

466
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,340
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it again you don't want</font>

467
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,510
them to worry about whether their

468
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,490
security or whether their communications

469
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,750
with you are encrypted because that's

470
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,320
time they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

471
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:54,210
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spot something on your lungs</font>

472
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:57,629
which would you really rather they do so

473
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:00,910
we specialize in society for a reason

474
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:03,400
because we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want people to pick up</font>

475
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:06,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">our trash we really want people to</font>

476
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,230
defend us or protect us from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> law we</font>

477
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,060
really want doctors to find the things

478
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,890
and fix them that are wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> with us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

479
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,600
we really don't want those people taking

480
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:17,680
their time away from that to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

481
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do what we do until you are ready to</font>

482
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">go spend a day of the week picking up</font>

483
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,260
everybody else's trash you're not in a

484
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,510
position<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell everybody else to learn</font>

485
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:30,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to do your job and I think any one</font>

486
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the things that that is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

487
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:35,230
cultural disconnect for for our century

488
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,120
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody got into computers</font>

489
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,000
because they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font>

490
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,489
nondeterministic systems I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

491
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">from like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> age nine when I started the</font>

492
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,330
great thing about computers versus

493
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:50,910
everything else in my life was that they

494
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:54,520
did exactly what I told them to do um so

495
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:56,650
we in society in general like one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

496
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,260
ways of talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> human history is</font>

497
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,090
that we were in this crazy state of

498
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">nature where lots of things could happen</font>

499
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,070
at need us or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know crawl inside our</font>

500
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,080
bodies and kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and we created these</font>

501
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,090
walled cities we created<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

502
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,960
civilizations to get more control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

503
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,669
that environment and then inside of

504
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,080
those inside of those barriers of

505
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,870
civilization we started creating more

506
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more</font>

507
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:24,260
complexity until we finally created a

508
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,629
network that is no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> deterministic</font>

509
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,230
so right inside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all that</font>

510
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:35,600
civilization we created the weird again

511
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:38,540
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> elyria huh and so</font>

512
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,000
that's where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are now we're inside of</font>

513
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:45,080
a civilization that is created a network

514
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,600
that is ecologically weird again so I'm

515
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,429
sorry we got onto this because we like

516
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,909
determinism but we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

517
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:54,260
deal with non deterministic systems and

518
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,809
part of that non determinism that we're

519
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,179
all facing is the human appetite it's

520
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:02,480
the human mind and it's the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

521
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">human mind so I think we all kind of</font>

522
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,070
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ourselves a lot of the time is</font>

523
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,379
like edging<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto math and physics but</font>

524
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:12,020
closer I think we're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

525
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,460
biology so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think all of you are slowly</font>

526
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:18,050
transforming into really weird

527
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:20,300
biologists and when you're inside of non

528
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,470
determinacy non terminus systems and

529
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,580
when you're talking to biologists one of

530
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,720
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will find out is that the</font>

531
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:30,678
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> job biologist is to listen it's to</font>

532
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:36,140
listen to these systems and to let go of

533
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:38,179
a certain amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of control not just to</font>

534
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,360
the words people say but to the needs

535
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:43,220
that they're describing you know one of

536
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,870
the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we live in a security</font>

537
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,809
nightmare is because everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

538
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,449
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use email usually to pass files</font>

539
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:52,850
and to get to things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not their</font>

540
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,580
email if we all just use text email it

541
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,469
wouldn't be quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> so bad so how do we</font>

542
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,510
meet those<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs personally and</font>

543
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,550
organizationally for passing files are

544
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,890
on the internet and yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still wake up</font>

545
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:07,639
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mornings ago saying it's 2016</font>

546
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:11,570
why can't we still pass miles on him why

547
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,400
is this still a problem I definitely

548
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought this problem will be solved by</font>

549
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:21,380
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mid-90s so when I talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

550
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:24,110
people about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff I and I am and I</font>

551
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,840
take time to explain systems to them I

552
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,459
also get them to describe the systems to

553
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,770
me that they're interacting with and

554
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,080
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they're wrong they're not</font>

555
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,980
wrong

556
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:39,080
they're describing their experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

557
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,970
one of your jobs if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

558
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">create a system that works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all together</font>

559
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,530
is to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what they're describing</font>

560
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:48,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that system through their</font>

561
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:51,860
experience you know one of the one of

562
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the early ones that I did many many</font>

563
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,360
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago was that I interviewed a bunch</font>

564
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,889
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their experience of</font>

565
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,020
certain software and they would

566
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,000
consistently say oh this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the part</font>

567
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">where it thinks the computer has to</font>

568
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">think here for a while most of the</font>

569
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:08,660
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was interviewing were older in</font>

570
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,610
this particular user set and what I

571
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,260
realized was that what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were telling</font>

572
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,729
me consistently when they say my

573
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:20,840
computer has to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it right now</font>

574
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:24,410
is that my computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is swapping and this</font>

575
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,600
was the 90s swapping was kind of a big

576
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:29,390
bigger deal in some ways at that point

577
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,399
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to learn something about</font>

578
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:35,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the architecture of the software from</font>

579
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,770
this very very colloquial way of talking

580
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,678
colloquial way of talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

581
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,510
computers there's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much more there</font>

582
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,540
there's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could be gathering</font>

583
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,190
from how people are using systems what

584
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,050
they need and when we meet those needs

585
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:52,370
or work with people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to meet those needs</font>

586
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:53,450
we start creating a better we start

587
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,309
creating the mechanisms for them to

588
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,720
understand their own lives and behave

589
00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:01,250
better in the systems that we're working

590
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">with and we get more free time because</font>

591
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,950
people I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say people are</font>

592
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:10,250
brilliant they're amazingly brilliant I

593
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:13,820
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who think they're</font>

594
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:16,730
idiots like know how to fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> out forms</font>

595
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,500
and drive which is kind of amazing when

596
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,050
you think of starting off as hunters and

597
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,600
gatherers we're really interesting

598
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,340
adaptable people we're leaving<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

599
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,990
interesting techniques on the table as

600
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:32,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">well ways of teaching our users things</font>

601
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:36,190
my favorite form of software interfaces

602
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:38,570
is games and not just because games yes

603
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,100
but because games had lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

604
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,980
interesting problems to solve and they

605
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,270
just went through and solved them and we

606
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,100
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably be picking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up some of</font>

607
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,780
these techniques

608
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,049
so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some screenshots from</font>

609
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,580
tutorial<font color="#E5E5E5"> modes of different games and</font>

610
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:54,039
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here is we're letting</font>

611
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:58,510
quite complex systems explain themselves

612
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,799
to a user and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

613
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:03,370
gaming field has spent a lot of time

614
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:06,100
working out you know complex internally

615
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:09,428
consistent systems being taught to the

616
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:11,590
user at the very beginning of use why is

617
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:13,990
that something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean some of it is</font>

618
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,459
fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and brings in humor and then</font>

619
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:20,710
it's like the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is actually</font>

620
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:22,360
explaining to you what a jump is at the

621
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,789
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time when it explains you where the</font>

622
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,939
jump is it's both humors and it makes a

623
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:30,760
connection to things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know from</font>

624
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,309
your own physical life into a into a

625
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,470
gaming environment so these tools are

626
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:38,110
out there we can start studying them we

627
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,640
can start picking them up and

628
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,658
generations have been scrambling

629
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:47,020
generations<font color="#E5E5E5"> even within you know our</font>

630
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:49,360
grandparents time have been scrambling

631
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,179
together a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the information that</font>

632
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,918
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create these literacies like</font>

633
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:55,360
fundamental literacies about the world

634
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,289
we're living in this is a screenshot

635
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:03,760
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Eames primer on communication</font>

636
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">theory you know when I start to to work</font>

637
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,900
on digital literacy I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with</font>

638
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:13,168
tools I start with the basic frameworks

639
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:15,640
of thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools fit into</font>

640
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:18,490
because then<font color="#CCCCCC"> people ask me the right</font>

641
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,890
questions then people<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask me things like</font>

642
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:24,159
but wait if I start using encryption and

643
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,900
nobody else's don't I stand out when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

644
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,159
hear that question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm thrilled because</font>

645
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,559
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tells me is the other person</font>

646
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:34,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">is starting to model the system in their</font>

647
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:38,918
head which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how humans work so the</font>

648
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:41,320
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hear consistently is that nobody</font>

649
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,390
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn this stuff i john</font>

650
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">oliver's line you smell like ham soup</font>

651
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,799
leave me alone you know I hear from

652
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,850
security people that we can't teach them

653
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:54,400
we can't teach them digital literacy but

654
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:57,639
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we also to recognize that</font>

655
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">security requires respect a mutual</font>

656
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">respect</font>

657
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,700
and right now there's not a lot of

658
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,620
respect between user and the users of

659
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and the technicians of the</font>

660
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:13,000
internet either way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's going</font>

661
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:15,490
to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> printing packed and it</font>

662
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,140
all feels really impossible to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

663
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and there's a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

664
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,840
have said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just not doable</font>

665
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,340
we're going to have to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to</font>

666
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,840
have a 21st century internet with

667
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,379
knowing nobody knowing how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

668
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:33,520
computers and and I don't think that's

669
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:36,940
either true or possible and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

670
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,750
want to pull you back into last<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

671
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,490
great project that was like this which

672
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,960
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was it was the great</font>

673
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,680
political project of the 19th century

674
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,720
which was creating democracies like

675
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,730
devolving power from aristocracies into

676
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,860
democracies and there was a realization

677
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,950
pretty early on in that process that you

678
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,570
couldn't have illiterate democracies so

679
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:00,940
one of the great projects of the 20th

680
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,429
century was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach everyone how to</font>

681
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:07,030
read and if you think teaching everyone

682
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:08,500
what a computer is is hard try<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

683
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:11,889
billions of people and teaching them how

684
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:14,260
to read that's a big ask but this is

685
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,990
what we did we went from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-percent</font>

686
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,620
literacy rate in 1902 an over 80%

687
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:22,240
literacy right by 2000 and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font>

688
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,919
impressive enough let's take it from

689
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,890
looking at those percentages<font color="#E5E5E5"> to looking</font>

690
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:30,880
at absolutes that's the literacy rate

691
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:33,040
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did that was an amazing</font>

692
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,130
project that humanity pulled together to

693
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">do and in case you wouldn't even impress</font>

694
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,430
it more impressive number let's look at

695
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:43,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that absolute figure at the end because</font>

696
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:49,150
that's 7.2 billion basically literate

697
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:52,270
people in in less than 200<font color="#CCCCCC"> years that</font>

698
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:54,790
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard we had to pull together</font>

699
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:56,470
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of resources we had to get a lot</font>

700
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,420
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who weren't traditionally</font>

701
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,310
talking to educators and weren't

702
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,960
traditionally educators into being

703
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,360
educators we invented a lot of

704
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,270
institutions for that and here's the

705
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,550
great thing we in the 21st century get

706
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,889
to reuse those institutions we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

707
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to build them again we can start</font>

bridge

709
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:19,299
in between the people who work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

710
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:21,039

712
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,710
in I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people in</font>

713
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:28,268
this community talking to educators

714
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:30,570
starting to bring in that generalized

715
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:32,830
knowledge that conceptual knowledge

716
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,960
start getting it in there early and

717
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:37,689
that's when we really start seeing this

718
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:42,029
landscape change it's not just getting

719
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:45,609
everybody to to install a flash update

720
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:48,519
it's getting them to understand what all

721
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:51,639
those words mean so they'll figure out

722
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:54,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it themselves and then we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

right now your biggest enemy and one of

00:31:56,379 --> 00:32:00,879
the biggest enemies of the 21st century

726
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:02,830
isn't evil hackers or apts or big

727
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:04,299
governments or organized crime or even

728
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,549
lazy programmers and apathetic

00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:16,989
machines when we start to beat that will

733
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:20,139
really be getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> somewhere and thank</font>

discussion take questions so lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

736
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:33,269
think about as usual and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Quinn's around</font>

737
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:33,269
questions yeah

738
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:42,629
I can't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I agree go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

739
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">man I can actually hear you from here</font>

740
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,610
there's there's a bit of kitchen going

741
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">on over here I mean if you've learned to</font>

742
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,389
read in the 50s you know how to read now

743
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,250
but if you've learnt how to use a

744
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,200
computer in the 90s you don't know how

745
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,840
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a computer now so computer</font>

746
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,480
literacy much harder two to three part I

747
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,000
I fundamentally disagree because i think

748
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my lifetime the fundamentals</font>

749
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">of digital literacy have not changed you</font>

750
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:12,030
know when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understanding the</font>

751
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,460
this is why i don't teach tools yeah if

752
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,649
I taught you you know if I tell you one

753
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,870
book about how the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> works in the</font>

754
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,880
1950s and I have a book actually from

755
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,169
1900 which was a which was a reference

756
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,480
book of all the things you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

757
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:26,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">know for the 20th century it's great if</font>

758
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was your only book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely your</font>

759
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,020
literacy would not help but if you're

760
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,760
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that you can kind of</font>

761
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,740
read future books because you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

762
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,260
this one book if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can understand that</font>

763
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,300
what a Turing machine is and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

764
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,429
thing is like I find when I am teaching

765
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,440
that when I start by explaining what a

766
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:46,590
network is and what these<font color="#E5E5E5"> machines are</font>

767
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,260
then things start to make sense then I

768
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,610
can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here's a tool I'll ask I'll</font>

769
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,820
tell you what the tool is you tell me

770
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:55,979
what it's doing and that knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

771
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifetime because frankly Claude Shannon</font>

772
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:03,740
is going to be right until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heat</font>

773
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:03,740
death of the universe well questions

774
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,580
ok

775
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:28,408
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question comes to mind when I speak to</font>

776
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:31,139
some people about encryption or whether

777
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:34,710
or not we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can communicate over pgp or</font>

778
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:37,740
signal this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that I thought</font>

779
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:40,110
was a popular way of thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

780
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:42,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">before the Snowden revelations but it</font>

781
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:44,490
still persists which is why don't we

782
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,010
communicate over signal why don't we use

783
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:50,489
PGP and they're like well I don't want

784
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:53,310
to I don't want to be suspicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

785
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:56,668
I've spoken to a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people for</font>

786
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,730
example who work on Iran and they your

787
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:01,140
fear that the u.s. government might be

788
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,210
spying on them they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> like well we</font>

789
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,009
don't we'd have<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to hide so we're</font>

790
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:09,300
okay with them reading all of our stuff

791
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:12,600
anyways and this sort of um this<font color="#CCCCCC"> stands</font>

792
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">tourist privacy still exists and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

793
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:18,000
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how you sort of approach</font>

794
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,650
this because yeah and I encounter this

795
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,869
quite a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

796
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,690
first stops on this and I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to point</font>

797
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:27,690
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the most successful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption</font>

798
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,060
that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever done is the one that we</font>

799
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get anyone to use that</font>

800
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,779
was it was kind of automatic which was

801
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,340
SSL like the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> big adoption when the</font>

802
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">security community event has ever had is</font>

803
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:43,680
SSL so explaining to people that they're

804
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:46,950
already using it is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know</font>

805
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,750
if you shop online if you read you know

806
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,299
your email<font color="#E5E5E5"> over something that's</font>

807
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,600
incorrect in two things if you log into

808
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,609
things you're already using encryption

809
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,779
because its infrastructure so getting

810
00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:00,000
people to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

811
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,100
infrastructural it gets them I think

812
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,540
much faster to pass the point of let's

813
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to stick another level of</font>

814
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,790
infrastructure in our communication I

815
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:12,930
feel like this is starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change in</font>

816
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:14,250
a positive way also<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of people</font>

817
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,169
starting to develop tools for dealing

818
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">with contacts collapse which is a whole</font>

819
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,430
other talk but like that idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that their</font>

820
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:24,150
stuff can be taken out of context is a

821
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:25,980
reason why you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to like</font>

822
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,090
seeing their stuff taken out of context

823
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,590
gets people to the point where they're

824
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,970
much more interested in encrypting

825
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:33,480
things that they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want taken out of</font>

826
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:35,040
context and and that for me it's been

827
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,140
the win with people who want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

828
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,880
very open lives like I will say

829
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,710
you know live<font color="#E5E5E5"> your open life where you</font>

830
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,960
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be open but where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

831
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:47,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be recontextualized let's use</font>

832
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:51,059
encryption and that you know that helps

833
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:53,250
so that they can see that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

834
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:54,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutiae of life is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> often the thing you</font>

835
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:59,700
want to encrypt much more so than the

836
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,710
big declarations of life but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again for</font>

837
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">me it always comes back to explaining</font>

838
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,470
the infrastructure explaining the

839
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,720
underlying thing that's where I get all

840
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,549
my wins when I'm doing training you

841
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,129
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you log into things you're</font>

842
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:13,829
already using encryption you do have

843
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:17,609
something to hide it's not a shameful

844
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:26,250
thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just your password I hope</font>

845
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:28,230
that house more questions ok I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

846
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:31,019
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite and how you you you ask</font>

847
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> involved with local</font>

848
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:35,609
educators how how do you recommend them

849
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,558
doing that there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of brains in</font>

850
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:39,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">this room lots of skills and experience</font>

851
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,539
and how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody in this room go</font>

852
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,269
out and get involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the with the</font>

853
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:47,670
local educators I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

854
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:51,149
this is very country and location

855
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:53,400
dependent I have well there's a lot of

856
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,750
youth education and hacker spaces and if

857
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,099
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a local youth education in</font>

858
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">hacker spaces i think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worthwhile to</font>

859
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:00,509
kind of set something like coderdojo up

860
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:02,730
in your city take a little time on that

861
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:04,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's a beginning because it starts</font>

862
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,660
to kind of get into kids space with a

863
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,308
sort of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff where you're</font>

864
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,170
starting to kind of just getting people

865
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:13,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in a very non-threatening way</font>

866
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:16,049
I mean it's entirely possible to talk to

867
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:18,329
local educators just formally goat you

868
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:20,849
just either talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the district or I</font>

869
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:22,740
don't know the shape of it and where you

870
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:25,109
live but talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a school talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

871
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,359
district and say hey I'm interested in

872
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:29,460
helping with<font color="#CCCCCC"> digital literacy issues and</font>

873
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,038
right now I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say I've spoken to</font>

874
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,599
educators around a lot of the world and

875
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:35,309
there's nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like digital</font>

876
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">literacy we're not interested in that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

877
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:38,519
don't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it's relevant there's not</font>

878
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,750
a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> school district anywhere in the</font>

879
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,359
world that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

880
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:46,289
everyone is desperately trying to

881
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:47,578
grapple with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems and and</font>

882
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:49,259
everyone's kind of trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

883
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,150
approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it's very</font>

884
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:53,820
haphazard

885
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,200
which is and very very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as</font>

886
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,120
connected with the people who are doing

887
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,580
this work to do in their data how many

888
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,560
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done are connected with are</font>

889
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:04,560
doing any work with educators at this

890
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:10,200
point raise your hand how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

891
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:12,590
have kids right so a few of you have a

892
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,960
bit more in this fight than the others

893
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you know so if you've got kids and</font>

894
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're getting involved with schools</font>

895
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:22,259
you know one of the places you can start

896
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:24,330
is the schools where your kids go and if

897
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,460
they can't work with you because of

898
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:29,160
often bureaucratic things say where do I

899
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,590
go next yeah I know that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

900
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,200
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time in any of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lives but this</font>

901
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,730
is kind of worth it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

902
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth at least taking a little bit of</font>

903
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,140
time and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font>

904
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,450
where you can't do a lot even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

905
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,220
know where the the interfaces are and

906
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,720
you can tell other people where they are

907
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,220
that starts getting the information

908
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,720
around that starts connecting the two

909
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,129
communities if you just find out you

910
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person that you talked</font>

911
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,850
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the school</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or at the district if</font>

912
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,410
you want to be helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> in these things</font>

913
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,640
if you want to contribute to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

914
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,440
curriculum or something like that

915
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,900
there's also really really interesting

916
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff going on in places like YouTube</font>

917
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:06,390
where people are doing a lot more

918
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:08,190
fascinating educational material if

919
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,690
you're ambitious you can put stuff up up

920
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,130
there if you're less ambitious you can

921
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,050
advise people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to put that</font>

922
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:15,630
sort of thing together just getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

923
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:17,430
knowledge out there being a resource<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

924
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,960
think is one of the places you can start

925
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:27,390
and finding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who need you as a</font>

926
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:29,480
resource any more questions no oh thank

927
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,480
