00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,199
so a little bit about me<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz I'm</font>

probably unknown to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

10
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,880
interesting computers and I received my

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,180
first computer when I was eight years

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">old and my dad upgraded at work so he</font>

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,160
gave me his hand me downs in late 1990s

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,580
I started working in brand protection

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,519
and I started getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interested</font>

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:49,660
in the research relating to date domain

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,250
involving the sale of counterfeit

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,860
software so was until the naughtiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,570
went to university and there I did a

00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:14,770
responded I then moved my PhD research

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,408
from looking at victimization to

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,300
offenders and I expanded the range of

collectivity as i was looking at but i

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,979
really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why some people</font>

began offending why they continued and

also why they stopped it towards end of

153
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:38,970
a blog post and he advised that he had a

154
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:42,800
leaked vidos database the that he had it

155
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:46,050
since July 2006 and it claimed it

156
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:51,020
contained entries on tens of thousands

157
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:53,669
of users and more than 150,000 attacks

158
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,250
the database apparently goes back two

159
00:07:53,669 --> 00:08:00,330
years and he claims that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that period</font>

160
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:06,090
the operators had made more than 600,000

161
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:08,039
US dollars he further alleged that the

165
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:24,870
this blog post was put up the two young

thing that he totally understands why

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:07,000
that was case on the 30 September<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,130
just 18 days ago the source code from

array to the botnet was apparently

182
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,810
responsible for the denial of service

increased scrutiny by security

189
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,470
started disconnecting infected devices

190
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,870
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure many of you know the botnet</font>

191
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,839
uses internet connected or Internet of

default passwords to launch<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks so</font>

194
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,209
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just move tax a little bit and</font>

195
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,740
have a look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pathways for</font>

196
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:54,060
cybercrime that I had to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

197
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,680
earlier so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at how</font>

198
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybercrime offenders become involved</font>

199
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,800
while they continue and why they stopped

200
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,739
so in relation to cybercrime offenders

201
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:11,260
in general I identified two distinct

202
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:13,839
pathways into their criminality general

203
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,810
cybercrime offenders use computers to

204
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,520
carry out their offenses but not at an

205
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:23,619
advanced level on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand we have</font>

206
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,569
technical cybercrime offenders and these

207
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,870
requires specialist knowledge and

208
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:32,440
understanding of computer systems and

209
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,360
unsurprisingly they have different

210
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,510
pathways in how they come involved in

211
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,310
criminality the general pathway starts

212
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,520
with some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of exposure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to strain</font>

213
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:46,180
this could be economic employment

214
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,430
problems mental health problems some

215
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,029
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of addictions such as gambling and</font>

216
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,769
drugs and they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be combined with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

217
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:57,699

workplace so they usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is striving</font>

219
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:02,680
for some goals such as monetary game or

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,860
the gratification of other drivers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

221
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,510
they use innovative means to do this

224
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:20,189
methods and inspirations from elsewhere

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand we have the technical</font>

227
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,380
other people the pathways towards

228
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,750
criminality is offending through

229
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:34,410
association with others both online and

230
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:36,060
offline online communities for example

231
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,709
are used for learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sharing</font>

information and ideologies recruitment

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:52,820
computers or gaming though would be

235
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:55,410
offenders begin by communicating online

236
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,840
they learn the techniques for committing

237
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber crime as well as a share the</font>

238
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,210
definitions and techniques of

<font color="#E5E5E5">neutralization that justify or excuse</font>

240
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:11,190
their behaviors to themselves and enable

241
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:14,150
offending to occur so maintenance

242
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:17,070
follows a rational choice perspective

243
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,560
common to both trajectories offending

244
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,870
behavior is maintained because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

245
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,709
benefits accrued by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> offender's as</font>

246
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,600
well as a low level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of risk so offenders</font>

247
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,780
perceive the likelihood have been

248
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,420
detection is low<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this has greater</font>

249
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,920
weight than the availability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of valuable</font>

250
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:39,599
punishments the harshness of available

251
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,729
punishments so benefits obtained from

252
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,950
general offending are usually financial

253
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,900
in nature will those engaged in

254
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,540
technical offending can enjoy a wider

255
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:52,260
range of benefits so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> includes</font>

256
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,050
skill development fun excitement social

257
00:12:52,260 --> 00:13:02,100
status power and in some cases even

258
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">sexual gratification the sistance also</font>

259
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,510
follows a rational choice perspective so

260
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,180
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defenders desist from</font>

261
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybercrime when they lower receive those</font>

262
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,010
benefits or when the costs outweigh the

263
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,530
benefits so here again it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only</font>

264
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">financial benefits but includes no</font>

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,269
sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> achievement from their actions</font>

267
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:26,939
again the cost to offenders is not

268
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:30,149
limited by<font color="#E5E5E5"> punishment meted out by the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">criminal justice system as offenders</font>

270
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:34,740
believes our likelihood of detection is

271
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:37,949
low the costs associated with offending

272
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,480
and mainly social in nature this

273
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:41,399
includes the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time they spent</font>

274
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,100
online which can interfere with

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:48,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">legitimate employment or intimate</font>

276
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:51,449
relationships costs also include a

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling of guilt or shame which may have</font>

physical contact with victims however

280
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:03,300
once stopped offenders may return<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

little bit back to 2014 and I'll sit in

<font color="#E5E5E5">my office chatting with Richard Clayton</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">brutal database and we said wondering</font>

291
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:42,510
about who were providing these services

one of the incredibly rewarding aspects

newsworthy was a lizard stressor service

300
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:06,859
so previous work had concentrated on the

301
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,319
technical side analyzing leaked

302
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:13,980

emails walk the dog and maybe you know

309
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,969
set up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brutal service</font>

310
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:34,699
operators need to understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> denial</font>

311
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,709
of service attacks are they need to have

312
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,599
the technical expertise to actually set

313
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:40,880
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> these services and carry them out and</font>

314
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,699
they order need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand to how to</font>

315
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,850
monetize the service and actually have

316
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:48,769
some kind of benefit out of it so we're

317
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:52,009
kind of speculating about this and we

318
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:57,819
started well the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to</font>

319
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:57,819
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> them ask the providers and so we did</font>

320
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,720
we can build a list of orbiter services

321
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:05,569
and this was done through searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

322
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,370
web and analyzing the forums where

323
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:11,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">buddha services are usually advertised</font>

324
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:14,420
so one example here is some hack forums

325
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:19,670
we obtained a sample size initially of

326
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:22,490
63 services I mainly contacted them

327
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,620
through the online forum online forms

328
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,480
provided on their customer facing sites

329
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,329
for technical the billing issues we can

330
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,459
go in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> open a ticket but in</font>

331
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:35,229
some cases rolls able to locate an email

332
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:38,239
address I also contacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that way</font>

333
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:41,420
so i put split the services into two

334
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,600
groups one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the idea was</font>

335
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,509
initially to invite them to participate

336
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">in online survey and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other group was</font>

337
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:52,939
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> invited to participate in an</font>

338
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,819
interactive interview online and then

339
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:57,019
after that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i received two invitations</font>

340
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:58,939
fear that method they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

341
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:03,850
swapped and this is order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maximize</font>

342
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:06,589
response rates but also to see which

343
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,520
method worked better when recruiting in

344
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:14,329
this type of population so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we</font>

345
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:17,000
went we identified 63<font color="#E5E5E5"> Buddha's however</font>

346
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:19,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">12 of those were actually offline during</font>

347
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,859
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> three-month data collection period</font>

348
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:31,030
so overall invitations were sent to 51

349
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:35,240
providers and these on average received

350
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:37,399
2.5 invitations so some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them replaced</font>

351
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,650
right away some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them offline at</font>

352
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,400
various times and<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of them also</font>

353
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,400
declined to participate

354
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,870
overall we've received 13 participants

355
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,730
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a 25-percent response rate</font>

356
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:55,110
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really good for an</font>

357
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:57,900
offender population 11 of those opted to

358
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:02,189
do the online survey and two of them

359
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,870
opted to do the interactive interview we

360
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,710
had for both of these a mixture of

361
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:09,330
closed and open ended questions which we

362
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,400
analyze both qualitatively and

363
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,980
quantitatively although mainly

364
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:18,630
descriptively and also participants

365
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:21,240
didn't have to answer all questions so

366
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:24,390
of course not all the participants or

367
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,240
people are contacted replied positively

368
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:32,550
so some people were worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:38,850
scammed others claim to know me and

00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:44,820
perhaps they did some politely declined

371
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:48,469
very politely I thought and some

372
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,470
declined a little bit more forcefully

373
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,670
someone also apparently did asked me

374
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,910
although I was sitting on Janet at the

<font color="#E5E5E5">time and didn't notice anything so yes</font>

387
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,199
we didn't ask more specific because we

wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it general because we</font>

offered in<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. dollars</font>

decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start providing these</font>

403
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:22,290

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,389
escalation in offending<font color="#E5E5E5"> so some people</font>

began using offenders herb booting

network testing and stressing and these

services were for the common good and

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,909
hosting providers should take more

462
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,500
evident within their answers we also

463
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,809
asked participants what proportion of

464
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,090
their income was provided by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Buddha</font>

465
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:45,460
services and<font color="#CCCCCC"> here the responses were</font>

466
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,980
fairly evenly distributed from ten

467
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,519
percent or less right through to over

468
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:55,269
ninety percent and we did some

469
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">calculations and we estimated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

470
00:23:55,269 --> 00:24:03,669

participants between 3705 and 5430 u.s.

472
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:09,480
dollars per<font color="#CCCCCC"> month the most disruption</font>

473
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,360
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was experienced by the operators</font>

474
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,549
related to receiving payment with

475
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,799
participants reporting that during this

476
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:20,850
period PayPal were regularly shutting

477
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:20,850
down their accounts

478
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,100
now you might have noticed that the

479
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:28,020
estimated income is lower than those

480
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,750
that estimates that have been made using

481
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:34,230
leaked<font color="#E5E5E5"> databases and we think this is</font>

482
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:37,230
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some bias here in the data so</font>

483
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:39,720
those that are hacked and leaks are more

484
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:42,030
likely to be large operators and more

485
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:49,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">likely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be targeted and therefore have</font>

486
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:52,230
a higher income so I said I wanted to

487
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:57,930
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> works best interviews or</font>

488
00:24:52,230 --> 00:25:00,840
surveys so the online surveys had a

489
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,010
higher response rate and this is

490
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,709
probably because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it right</font>

491
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,900
there and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to reply</font>

492
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,200
to me you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it time</font>

493
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:14,580
provide contact details in order to do

494
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,950
an interactive interview however the

495
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:20,340
interactive interviews provided more

496
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:24,540
in-depth and thoughtful answers they

497
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:26,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">provided myself with the opportunity to</font>

498
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,800
ask further questions for the probing

499
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,470
questions about the responses they

500
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,470
provide and to have them expand on

501
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:43,740
certain topics and also there were fewer

502
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:45,600
unanswered questions overall respondents

503
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,930
were not concerned that law enforcement

504
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,939
would take action against them and this

505
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:54,060
perhaps explains why such a large

506
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:57,630
proportion we will end espect me because

507
00:25:54,060 --> 00:26:01,440
it was low risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will be interesting</font>

511
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:17,100
to perceive the risk has been higher and

512
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:18,629
then perhaps lay low for a while or<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

533

human research so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

592
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:28,280
assurances there and so I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

593
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:33,699
time for questions for anyone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

594
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,700
like to quiz me about what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

595
00:30:43,929 --> 00:31:05,929
this is a first no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> well back um no</font>

596
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,929
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of going</font>

597
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:11,659
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ethics requirements in there</font>

598
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:14,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of the law enforcement interest</font>

599
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:17,990
in this area I didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

600
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,149
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any information that could be used</font>

601
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,070
by law enforcement if for example they

602
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:24,139
subpoenaed me and ordered<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to provide</font>

603
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,879
this data and so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it best not</font>

604
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:36,168
to collect that and not to do any

605
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:38,748
analysis on that any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions No</font>

606
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:41,149
if not if you're a researcher reach out

607
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:43,369
to Alice on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter or email and help</font>
