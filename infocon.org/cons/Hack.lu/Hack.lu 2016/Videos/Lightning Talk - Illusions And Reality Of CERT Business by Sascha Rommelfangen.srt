Luxembourg and we are used to request

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,550
takedown so malicious content from the

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:46,578
internet from servers taking down yeah

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,800
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't limit</font>

15

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire word as far as we can and as</font>

far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are supported by that very</font>

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,280
quick statistic about the work we have

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:07,220
done in the last three months we have

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,020
been looking at around 19 individual

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,950
mass spam campaigns mainly dried

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:16,490
excellent lucky and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:19,970
yeah we could work on around<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2500</font>

24
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:23,110
individual takedown requests all over

25
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:28,310
the world majority of those have been

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:30,440
closed within the first 48 hours so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,430
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the content was made of</font>

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:39,110
unavailable out of these most are closed

29
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:42,200
within 24 hours many could be closed

30
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,030
within few hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some ISPs are</font>

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,510
really really really fast and they do it

32
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,430
within minutes on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> downside some are</font>

33
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:55,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">still left and that's around 250</font>

34
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:58,550
incidents over 250 yeah takedown

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,500
requests that are still open and they

36
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,119
are aged between seven days and three

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:14,330
months

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:17,980
laughs last plus many of them take much

39
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:20,540
longer than 48<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours to to be taken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

40
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,760
so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it take down process what</font>

41
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,030
is the theory in theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> you discover</font>

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,030
malicious content on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet by</font>

43
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,460
whatever means then you identify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

44
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">owner of that so you check the URL what</font>

45
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,630
does to you what is the who is giving

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,580
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain what is the waste what it</font>

47
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,710
for the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on so you</font>

48
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,190
identify the owner the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosted AI speed</font>

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,020
registrar and you inform all of them so

50
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,950
that some one of them is able to acts on

51
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:51,320
it in an ideal world in a short time

52
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,329
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> you receive the feedback that this</font>

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,810
content has been removed or made

54
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,190
unavailable or in an even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more idea word</font>

55
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,690
that the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been reinstalled</font>

56
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,670
because they saw that it's so

57
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,640
compromised that it's yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> photo trash</font>

58
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">bin well and then the takedown is over</font>

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,958
we get a notification we can close or we

60
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,540
see that it's over that it's taken down

61
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can close the case that's not</font>

62
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,840
reality reality is we discover militias

63
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:21,080
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet we identify the owner we</font>

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:26,560
inform them and then interesting things

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:29,020
happen and we come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bet that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later now</font>

66
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,090
then we initiate the top secret process

67
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:35,720
that is a really really really top

68
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:40,760
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where after all we always</font>

69
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,920
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the stuff now this is kind of</font>

70
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,489
mail that we sent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to the ousters</font>

71
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,859
that's described in the UAE<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

72
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:53,150
describing that it's already known<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

73
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:56,420
malicious on various<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and we</font>

74
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain what is what is wrong and that's</font>

75
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,170
on that machine what they can do to

76
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,269
check it and we have the best practices

77
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:06,880
that we link to yes that looks like

78
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,880
fishing yes

79
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:14,829
ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Theory there yes some things</font>

80
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,649
could go wrong and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

81
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:20,108
collection of the things from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past</font>

82
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:24,099
few months what could go wrong if you

83
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">send such an announcement to to to the</font>

enter all that information again into a

109
00:05:48,970 --> 00:06:02,710
web form great abuse handlers use

110
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:06,490
clamavi to scan their content on the

111
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,750
servers and type find nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay why</font>

112

they reply back that the nature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

126
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,000
abuse report is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> entirely clear yeah</font>

127
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,610
yeah maybe their job description is also

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:09,720
not entirely clear classic abuse mailbox

129

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,310
okay now how can we escalate such a

133
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,169
situation because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually don't want</font>

134
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:36,270
to give up what's now coming is a

135
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:38,549
condensed almost real telephone

136
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,200
conversation it's it what is in fact a

137
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,780
condensed version of several telephone
