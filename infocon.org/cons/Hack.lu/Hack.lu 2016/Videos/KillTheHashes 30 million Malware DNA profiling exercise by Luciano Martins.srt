1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:14,440
thank you very much it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great honor</font>

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:17,210
to be here what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to present I'm</font>

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,399
the original research is way by three

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,520
people which I just the one that make it

5
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:25,099
to here it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the other two got</font>

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,040
lost it's just it couldn't make it so

7
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:32,110
what we started as a profile and

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:35,450
exercise end up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a tool that we</font>

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:39,680
release and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it how</font>

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:43,610
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we started from doing DNA my</font>

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,030
way profiling to actual building a full

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:50,450
flash tool to be able to that to achieve

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:53,930
that so when we start with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> research</font>

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:56,989
we we kind of knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are going to</font>

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,989
encounter a few few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going</font>

16
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:02,750
to be quite complete complicated you

17
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:04,819
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a you know in terms of</font>

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,930
issue for malware hunters now

19
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:11,240
researchers there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:15,350
code there is mean office gated

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:18,169
transform or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> being manipulated</font>

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,600
in the way that makes you know my where

23
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,210
researchers make the work quite

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,220
difficult you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time so data in</font>

25
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,080
terms of data for kitchen techniques and

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">taints</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know trying to evade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,119
you know detection from nine to rise

28
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,190
companies right so we and then also we

29
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,860
having a polymorphic code and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

30
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,270
that so we kind of knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are you</font>

31
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,799
know it's gonna be quite complicated to

32
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,979
achieve something like this you know to

33
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:46,760
do actual profiling or clustering of

34
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:49,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware right on on the other hand you</font>

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">know in the past the there was you know</font>

36
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,590
it was it was was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say it was</font>

37
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:59,000
easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually take my work because</font>

38
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:04,159
you know it was often very expensive to

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,250
compute CPU time to build a new a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

40
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,158
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you interact you know a new</font>

41
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,849
version of them our so this phase CPU

42
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:15,859
time is meaningless at the cost of so

43
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:18,859
builders these days

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,130
bill you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the malware file executive</font>

45
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,380
or whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> micro whatever for</font>

46
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,660
each interaction for each time it needs

47
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,670
to be you know launch it right so on

48
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,570
that we have a note here from the

49
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:37,070
verizon analysis that data breach that

50
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:39,829
they profile 40 million our records and

51
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:43,660
out of you know through multiple

52
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:47,810
companies and out of that the only found

53
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:52,640
20,000 hashes the words present in

54
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:54,230
multiple companies the means the

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">majority of them are actually unique</font>

56
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,390
right so we canna knew that so but we

57
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">still do you know picture the problem</font>

58
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,010
here and then we encounter with stuff

59
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,070
like this where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot of</font>

60
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:10,220
antivirus company but a lot of detail

61
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:14,510
reports were you know it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

62
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:18,739
not so deep head techie heavy<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

63
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,769
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the means all this data</font>

64
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and not like an easy way to represent</font>

65
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:26,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that data because then you know at the</font>

66
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,130
end of report you reading and this is

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,299
for Dooku from the people from<font color="#CCCCCC"> curse</font>

68
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:34,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">pesky this like it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make too much</font>

69
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,080
sense when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you read I well you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see you</font>

70
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,350
know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks like a sequel</font>

71
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,750
and then you have IP is there some DL

72
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,000
name but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually difficult to have</font>

73
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,269
me for information or those who don't

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,470
fully understand the whole picture right

75
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,930
that also make complicated you know

76
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:54,680
signature and heuristics<font color="#E5E5E5"> bait detection</font>

77
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,390
on those things that you or you see in

78
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,950
those reports on they put a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

79
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,649
detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end the give you</font>

80
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,470
choose a bunch of hashes on the tip so

81
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:06,380
it's like something this needs to be

82
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:10,239
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle right so that's</font>

83
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,859
where you know we say those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

84
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,010
remainings of the cap when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font>

85
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,109
a report you read some from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Simon take</font>

86
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,969
forever company and at the very end just

87
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:21,228
putting a bunch of hashes and it's like

88
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,510
all deluded you know the information

89
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:28,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can action on top of those</font>

90
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:29,810
right so example that is that will still

91
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,510
read those reports on you

92
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,540
see this specific things that you have

93
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:38,030
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research we put I would</font>

94
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,310
choose for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> here just to make a</font>

95
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">quick just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as stand next we know what</font>

96
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,160
Stan Nexus is you know we know when it

97
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,169
is everybody know what is what it was

98
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,639
but we know that specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

99
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:56,120
use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PLC library from Siemens mantic</font>

100
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,430
that you know is using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> year all to</font>

101
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,400
execute some commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all that won't</font>

102
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,710
all know this story so that you know the

103
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,419
family use that characteristic

104
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:09,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically to disagree on that right</font>

105
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:11,960
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one form now from zu or</font>

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,419
the bots which is the back in my where

107
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,270
this this specific region of the in the

108
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,760
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has you know has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

109
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,620
the same across multiple module family

110
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,289
so you have actual characteristic out of

111
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,540
that singles for Dina which is part of

112
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:31,550
the animal<font color="#E5E5E5"> form which is supposed to be</font>

113
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,410
a nation state sponsor malware and also

114
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,530
from you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> put example the</font>

115
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,890
Bangladesh shark which the man we're

116
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,590
actually hook into a deal to go to you

117
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:46,640
know you know mobile patches the cold

118
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:49,310
and unsee that a transaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

119
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,219
there are quite specific characteristics

120
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,050
out of example those for that no matter

121
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,150
what you do you need to have those

122
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:00,500
peaceful information right so imagine if

123
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:03,020
you have a way to say hey I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

124
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">search for this particular thing and</font>

125
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:09,830
come out you know results out of that

126
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,869
right so just example<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand next majan</font>

127
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,979
again a way that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you know put</font>

128
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:18,320
just you know Dino<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exe and search</font>

129
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:20,750
that information on a bunch of hashes

130
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,229
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine a way that you can put a</font>

131
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,479
section of the heart of the file and

132
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,669
give you only all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> other you know my</font>

133
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:34,520
where's that matches that thing the same

134
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:36,409
goes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> vb swift for giving you in all</font>

135
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,940
these files that have that reference

136
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:42,729
there within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in within</font>

137
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">the files itself</font>

138
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,039
text within the files so that got us

139
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:53,710
thinking saying wait wait wait wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

140
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:55,449
can actually probably build a system to

141
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,339
be able to achieve the research with you

142
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:00,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do build a system</font>

143
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:02,860
framework to<font color="#E5E5E5"> process define in the way</font>

144
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,900
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we'll get most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value out of it</font>

145
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,319
we're not just going to use like

146
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,359
everybody like five ways hashes which is

147
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,339
easy to compute and faster everybody

148
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,259
loves that you know everybody loves you

149
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,419
know antivirus like now going after

150
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,849
behavior you know it's faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font>

151
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:21,159
so we gotta you know all these pieces

152
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:26,020
thinking and saying wait maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

153
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:30,099
build a DNA are going to explain what

154
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,680
what DNA with DNA means for us to you

155
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:35,289
know search that whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

156
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,759
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being recovered out of</font>

157
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:40,080
those patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and characteristic so</font>

158
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:44,289
build a search profile and engine but

159
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,258
specific to the file type itself when I

160
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:49,270
mean file type<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know ap executables</font>

161
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,249
has you know all the definitions or all

162
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,549
the possibilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the file type</font>

163
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:57,899
defines and these hundreds of that

164
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,259
possibilities you go for file type of

165
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:04,029
office file like a world war file having

166
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,399
a lot of all the definitions you know

167
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:09,039
how many pages have many words how many

168
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,129
is it if it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a screenshot and this is</font>

169
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">the size this resolution all those</font>

170
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:15,399
characteristics are within<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file</font>

171
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:19,839
format right and on top of that you know

172
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:22,229
Burt and build a search capability on

173
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:26,110
those on<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know on that data</font>

174
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:29,680
rationalized categorize all the data so

175
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:33,159
we can do at the very end a<font color="#E5E5E5"> large scale</font>

176
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,709
my word analytics right so you know

177
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll package all these files</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defining</font>

178
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:41,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the format and we define in each of</font>

179
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,968
those interactions and each of those you

180
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">know components in a very rational</font>

181
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:48,130
database format so we can query that

182
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:52,240
information and make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> look better</font>

183
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so now we're gonna when a one</font>

184
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,410
other thing i want to show is not like

185
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if we go for PE file format</font>

186
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,269
we have those all those you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> cat you</font>

187
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:04,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">know definitions on the file format you</font>

188
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:08,740
know five headers the sections resources

189
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:12,279
certificate sighs versions import table

190
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,250
and export table but the waist look like

191
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:18,490
this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> choose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys I really don't</font>

192
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,350
want you to remember all this I need you

193
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,500
guys to picture something like this

194
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,839
right which I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's a piece of</font>

195
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,810
motor at truly I've just school the

196
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,759
first one I pick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but imagine like</font>

197
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:37,138
a file an hour when you had all those

198
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:40,750
small pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> that together it makes it a</font>

199
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:44,050
whole thing a whole working operable

200
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,689
thing so why I will search for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

201
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,849
entire thing when maybe I change one

202
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:51,610
small piece and of course it becomes a

203
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,250
different hash right so an example of

204
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,509
this is if this is our own a piece of a

205
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:01,540
car and I still this car from you you

206
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know someone who I could</font>

207
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">still your car a painting in a different</font>

208
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,949
corner it's still your car it's just

209
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:12,099
painted a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different way right so the</font>

210
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:16,649
concept goes like this if we process all

211
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:19,769
this you know files and we track all the

212
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:24,040
connectivity characteristic possible

213
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:26,519
maybe we can find better<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to search</font>

214
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:31,360
and to do matching and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tulu clustering</font>

215
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:33,880
which is what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did so again I don't</font>

216
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,630
want to see it like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want a more</font>

217
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,730
see you like this like a whole set of

218
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,790
pieces that<font color="#CCCCCC"> come together to make a</font>

219
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:45,759
malware itself so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did</font>

220
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,769
and to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some a little bit</font>

221
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:51,880
analytics on old it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

222
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:53,889
rationalize information that we extract

223
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,120
for each of the five we process and we

224
00:10:53,889 --> 00:11:00,459
process fairly million files malware we

225
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,360
start clustering doing clustering on

226
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:06,660
each of the of some of the files that we

227
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,120
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to class sure so in this case is</font>

228
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,939
Dooku and this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very</font>

229
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,940
very nice Dooku is supposed to be a

230
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,940
nation-state<font color="#E5E5E5"> mal were supposed to be for</font>

231
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:24,120
you know some big government in America

232
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:27,580
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we can see if out of one</font>

233
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:31,480
profile one data extraction the first

234
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,610
one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rev we have another one</font>

235
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,130
that it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same the clustering is</font>

236
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,370
the same the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bubble is how</font>

237
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:42,880
big on how what's the percentage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

238
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,710
similarity and the others are the ones

239
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,430
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> has less percent of</font>

240
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:52,690
similarity from the father<font color="#CCCCCC"> and goes like</font>

241
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:55,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">a spiral like that right so this is</font>

242
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:58,540
something really really beautiful this

243
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:01,630
is this is the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> chart which is you</font>

244
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,760
know out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> father right we start</font>

245
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:09,130
searching you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> percentile similarity</font>

246
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:12,700
and at some point actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> by 34.7</font>

247
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:15,670
percent what is Dooku he become a

248
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:20,140
stomachs if it comes the second version

249
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:22,959
of stomachs and then it continues in the

250
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the way below and this is code this</font>

251
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,290
is no like me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think oh this is this is</font>

252
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:34,860
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cold this is like functions</font>

253
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:37,150
IP eyes resources all crammed together a

254
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,480
scramble you know getting in small

255
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,970
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comparing the father the</font>

256
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,220
father which is Dooku against all the

257
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:50,650
other ones want that the ones we have in

258
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:53,670
30 million database set so it could be

259
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know whoever built stomachs</font>

260
00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:01,089
probably build Dooku or it could be that

261
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the priming almost in the same way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

262
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:06,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's almost using the same techniques</font>

263
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:09,250
almost using the same IP eyes to able to

264
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:13,029
achieve that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and example I die</font>

265
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:16,540
that two different pieces of two files

266
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:19,480
that there had you know a different hash

267
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,750
value have you know the same IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

268
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,620
probably have the same size<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the same</font>

269
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,330
day

270
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,339
are of course they're different they

271
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,220
have some small piece that make the two

272
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:32,890
files being different but for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

273
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,860
two things are the same because it

274
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:38,890
shares the same functions resources on

275
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:43,600
some other thing and this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

276
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:45,819
driver for one of those mmm nay supposed

277
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,520
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nation estate malware so I know</font>

278
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all this we can get a lot more</font>

279
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">information out of the files and that's</font>

280
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,210
the i guess the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beauty of this when you</font>

281
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:59,020
rationalize a lot of data and start

282
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:01,120
making sense on that and one of this one

283
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,210
a one I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we thought about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it we</font>

284
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:09,820
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find what's the worst day for</font>

285
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:13,200
the user in terms of malware activity I

286
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:18,850
would say ok maybe is we go for file

287
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:21,339
that tie a file-based time we find we

288
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,170
call it the worst day for users because

289
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:25,270
a lot of my work being compiling that

290
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:29,979
day of course we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> me no malware</font>

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:32,980
authors you know the modifies the file

292
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,890
stamp of the files so we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

293
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:38,620
I at the rate at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know before</font>

294
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the actual research we say for</font>

295
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,690
sure is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be epic equals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

296
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,000
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first you know the first</font>

297
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,850
been modified the time son to become

298
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero meaning start when you know in the</font>

299
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">70s first of January so of course they</font>

300
00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:00,029
my routers will clean that data and we

301
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:05,110
the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them will be like that</font>

302
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:07,360
which we wrong and this is the beauty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

303
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,660
this when you start processing data that

304
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,880
the day something you actually think is

305
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,000
the data is actually telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

306
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,189
is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality so we say we got this and</font>

307
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,160
with the size of the bubbles are the

308
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:24,339
size and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many you know times are you</font>

309
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,589
know that represent in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

310
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:29,500
exercise in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the summary that with it of</font>

311
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:31,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">all files and right there you have a</font>

312
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,959
file the material then or like a huge

313
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,989
module event it's like 492 and we say

314
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,969
like this is

315
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,580
he's like really wrong somewhere is

316
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,940
really wrong the second one it was epic

317
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:47,149
equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero which is what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe but</font>

318
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,279
was wrong we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very wrong so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

319
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:52,610
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> date all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say like start googling</font>

320
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:56,300
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that for six different</font>

321
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:58,430
version of delphi-- the linker was

322
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,670
actually pulling the same time stop it

323
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:06,349
was hard-coded in the linker the build

324
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:08,270
the file so we say oh that's it is the

325
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,459
linker that live in and all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> files</font>

326
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,490
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know they'll feel all</font>

327
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:15,800
versions and again the data is telling

328
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,649
us something different<font color="#CCCCCC"> than there was</font>

329
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know in our mind and we could this</font>

330
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:24,589
we build another one is like we said

331
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:27,170
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cluster the same same</font>

332
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,610
absolutely same code we determine you

333
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,079
know what the code section in the file

334
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:34,220
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something very complicated but</font>

335
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,350
make it simple and we say we're going to

336
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,570
class sir all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code that's actually</font>

337
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:43,160
been the same in entire database set and

338
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,290
right there we say we're going to spot

339
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,149
the family of<font color="#CCCCCC"> C use then we're going to</font>

340
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,399
spot the pharmacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> board we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

341
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:52,370
spot some of the families that well no

342
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:56,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">as been sharing you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe the</font>

343
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,339
builder of the malware will actually you

344
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:00,800
know it will do a lazy job it would just

345
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:04,220
modify a piece of the file<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not the</font>

346
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,760
entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and we'll cluster all the</font>

347
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:11,660
data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're terribly wrong the thing</font>

348
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,449
we forgot our the actual installers you

349
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:18,199
know news of installer you know like the

350
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:21,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">installed she'll let us use now or the</font>

351
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,520
seven-seat out extract and some other

352
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:26,149
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a Chinese</font>

353
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,670
installer somewhere on and again

354
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,610
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we thought about it we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot</font>

355
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,710
about installers and then like in the

356
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,209
data is talking back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us and say</font>

357
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,929
you're wrong what were you actually

358
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,090
thinking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we said we wanna</font>

359
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:43,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">Turman you know roughly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

360
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire set what's the actual you know</font>

361
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:49,909
mean of the data in terms of percentage

362
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:53,209
what's the actual space

363
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:56,090
out of it and it turns out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like a</font>

364
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:58,340
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> KS is the average over all the</font>

365
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">my word that we have and since we</font>

366
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:05,480
process a lot of files we had to have a

367
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:07,550
table which grabs all the import table

368
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,430
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the files of a process and</font>

369
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:14,389
have you know what's the count for each

370
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:17,150
of IPI that is actually being used in

371
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,760
the system as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see out of the</font>

372
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:26,270
deal and necessary to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get proper dress</font>

373
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:28,760
is 12 million times call in within the

374
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,160
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we process and we do this is</font>

375
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,860
actually very useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

376
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,680
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope right now i</font>

377
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,629
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works so you can see you know we</font>

378
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,060
have for each of five process with your

379
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:44,660
account we put in in there in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> van</font>

380
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,850
database and we use this data to use it

381
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,540
with some other connectors and produce

382
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,580
you know a better way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present data so</font>

383
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,590
i give you example if we process a file

384
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has been dumped at the memory all</font>

385
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,149
the import tables absolutely broken

386
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,360
there's nothing you can do it but still

387
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:05,690
the piece of text is within whatever you

388
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,270
dumped in the memory so if I know this

389
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:12,050
piece of text is idea I that I have it

390
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:15,379
in my database I can relate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

391
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:18,020
problem is using this IP I so again of

392
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,300
data that is not useful not working

393
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,010
because it's a career<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work you</font>

394
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:27,050
can still get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know meaningful</font>

395
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:30,970
information out of that now it's a check

396
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:33,830
this I see if it works so we mentioned

397
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:37,550
and this is I hope we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

398
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:40,669
beauty out of bad data imagine this you

399
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:43,159
know for each IP I i put kind of the

400
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:48,080
size that represent within the entire

401
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:51,800
set so that's you know one of the eight

402
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,649
million foreign IP I this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the bit</font>

403
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Verilog imagine the size of the bubbles</font>

404
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,020
are the size or how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> County</font>

405
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:03,320
represents in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire database set</font>

406
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,889
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have that you know imagine</font>

407
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:10,909
that

408
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:13,790
you know in a universe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this galaxy has</font>

409
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:16,790
this planet that is like it's called

410
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:20,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">butala which one a log in this case so</font>

411
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:23,120
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so imagine that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

412
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:28,910
beauty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch that we can actually</font>

413
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:35,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">zoom out and becomes you know different</font>

414
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:41,090
planets I'm still in the galaxy of

415
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:44,949
kernel32 imagine all the other different

416
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,949
galaxies that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually out there</font>

417
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,490
this is starting to become you know

418
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,850
something maybe i'm not expecting

419
00:20:52,490 --> 00:21:00,160
everybody to read it but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

420
00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:07,219
channel 32 now if I move this way oh I

421
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:14,240
have user32 and it's just 20 f so

422
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:21,380
imagine i zoom out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I have more and I</font>

423
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:30,320
have more and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amor amor</font>

424
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:35,710
and everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is like how it</font>

425
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:38,419
looks when you process 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> million files</font>

426
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:42,770
looks like a universe of function calls

427
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:45,110
each Bible represent actual yell on each

428
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:48,740
bubble represents you know the size of

429
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:52,159
all the colors is how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> in no</font>

430
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,770
instance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that function is being</font>

431
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,230
called so now we have actually spread

432
00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:00,010
the distribution for all the IP is from

433
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,960
now whether we process in a graph and

434
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:05,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's what we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presented so the</font>

435
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,790
beauty of this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is limited soon</font>

436
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:12,639
sorry for that the file is 80 megabyte

437
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:15,440
but the beauty is this is defined not

438
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,510
the one they're you know not this one

439
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">not everybody calls this one</font>

440
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:25,400
the beauty is finding like this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

441
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,100
the ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just a few people</font>

442
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:34,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this is like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> symbol one HTTP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IP I</font>

443
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:38,090
all the ones you know sorry it's

444
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:41,720
complicated this one's like maybe a

445
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">typist somewhere let's NTU map section</font>

446
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:52,100
or this one with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

447
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,810
map you know probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

448
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,360
all the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and this is</font>

449
00:22:53,810 --> 00:23:01,639
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> were this longer this is a Type O</font>

450
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,469
Lord livre re yeah create file are in a

451
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,860
different this is a canal authority with

452
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:11,750
a dot again trying to masquerade the

453
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:13,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">original one right so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what it</font>

454
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:15,740
looks like when you process a lot of it

455
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:20,300
that's again the data is telling us you

456
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:26,150
know hi looks in a universe type let me

457
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:31,820
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the presentation we call it</font>

458
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:36,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the universe my word IP is that's you</font>

459
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:39,760
know some of these revisions for um some

460
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:43,340
of the deals being cold and some of that

461
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:46,070
and again this is a I've never seen a my

462
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,870
graphic like that before so it looks up

463
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,530
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks beauti out of like mess</font>

464
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:53,360
it looks looks beautiful out of that so

465
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">we talked about the research but we say</font>

466
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,830
we built a software to do the research

467
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did so we're</font>

468
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk a little bit of the</font>

469
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:04,790
architecture and some examples so we're

470
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:09,020
basically do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is enjoying and this</font>

471
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">self y hat there that you know has a</font>

472
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:19,629
portal and out of that the portal calls

473
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the IP eyes and all the IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is is this</font>

474
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:26,960
182<font color="#E5E5E5"> different IP eyes as right now you</font>

475
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,209
call those IP is to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font>

476
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,399
data push the data or query the data

477
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,080
basically this IP I for each

478
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,820
differential for each of the five format

479
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,379
that we have been in the data in the

480
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:41,359
system the framework and then when you

481
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:44,539
submit something it says hey this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

482
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,609
mind type<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know executable</font>

483
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,950
he goes through the processors the

484
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:51,849
process has it has his own plug-in

485
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:54,769
system they extract each of them

486
00:24:51,849 --> 00:25:00,849
characteristic that each of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPI and</font>

487
00:24:54,769 --> 00:25:03,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">so each of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the processor clean blowing</font>

488
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:06,259
do like one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have one plug in the</font>

489
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:09,109
extract you know the strings want blue

490
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:12,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">and extract you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perform some other</font>

491
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:14,570
function like ssl leap string different

492
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:17,178
strengths that process to annex you can

493
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually add that and and you can</font>

494
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:21,349
actually modify the code whatever you

495
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:23,989
want and add your processor or your

496
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:27,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">plugin so you wanna do I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

497
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:29,929
like to do flaws which is the new tool

498
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:31,879
now and just coded the you know being

499
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:34,489
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to execute flaws it for each of the</font>

500
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:37,099
file when it matches the mind time you

501
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:39,229
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do that and that goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

502
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:42,109
know the search the Codex search in

503
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:43,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">China and all that all that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

504
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:49,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">Russian our information gets spread</font>

505
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:51,080
through different MongoDB database<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80</font>

506
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,960
collections if you want to prefer like

507
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,908
that where we store the samples and we

508
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,289
stored the meta data that we extractive

509
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:59,809
the samples and we stirred the

510
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:02,570
versioning of the plugins we do that

511
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:04,158
because maybe you develop one<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin and</font>

512
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,960
then you forgot something you want to

513
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">modify the plan you upgraded version and</font>

514
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,389
you need to execute only to start

515
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:14,509
plugging across the entire database set

516
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:16,789
so out of that I being on in a different

517
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:19,279
section is the actual web portal where

518
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:22,820
you're going to see a few samples in a

519
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:26,210
minute so out of that all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cole get</font>

520
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:29,749
you know been executed and give you the

521
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,879
data in a rational way that you can have

522
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:34,789
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> without rational</font>

523
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:36,619
information you can you know do my work

524
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:38,389
comp aeration<font color="#CCCCCC"> X you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for each of</font>

525
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:41,509
them made and made a data items that we

526
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:43,728
strive for each one of them and you can

527
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:45,159
do acro<font color="#CCCCCC"> comparation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by each of the</font>

528
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:47,320
single pieces so

529
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,809
you build a similarity base with the

530
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,229
sitting you can also you know out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of if</font>

531
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:56,559
you say this file<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iran's similarity and</font>

532
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:58,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">its equal as this for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever reason or</font>

533
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,549
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this piece you can just select</font>

534
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">12 of the finals and you create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

535
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:05,918
automatically general rule all of us who

536
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,509
are you hunting for a family<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font>

537
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,629
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> the files if we get the files and</font>

538
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:12,609
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a really other rule</font>

539
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,769
yeah that will actually protect you for

540
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:17,799
that given family if it stays the way it

541
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:20,019
stays in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a normal pattern like that and</font>

542
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:23,499
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you bring you what we call it</font>

543
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:27,159
the analyst panel which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a website</font>

544
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:31,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">with 150 different searchable index</font>

545
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:34,450
items out of that out of each file so

546
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:38,349
the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's behind is we use</font>

547
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:41,470
great FS for storage of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file with</font>

548
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:44,918
Mongo was running on wound to the web is

549
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:47,019
angular we used III for the graphics all

550
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,229
those bubbles<font color="#E5E5E5"> you saw when you of course</font>

551
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:52,570
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for easy implementation issue</font>

552
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:54,849
deployment and implementation is all

553
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:58,479
coded in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python that you can actually go</font>

554
00:27:54,849 --> 00:28:01,570
there just do whatever with the code Wiz

555
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:05,200
bottle as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPI and when i'll give em</font>

556
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:07,720
use a batch so i want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you some</font>

557
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,369
of them will say some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the examples</font>

558
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:15,970
that we will just be put together so in

559
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:18,789
this case one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

560
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,940
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all of the files are you</font>

561
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:25,389
know the sick this fine certificate the

562
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:30,489
code that's within the file so someone

563
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:32,678
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a certificate and and you</font>

564
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:35,259
process a file that has the certificates

565
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,529
your number in this case this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is search</font>

566
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:40,330
for for duku duku to actually if you

567
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:42,820
know the certificate thumb prints<font color="#CCCCCC"> here a</font>

568
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:45,039
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just put the certificate</font>

569
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,049
son Prince your number and we'll search

570
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will bring you that</font>

00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:01,379
name

575
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:04,409
this case it's a it's a malware goal

576
00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:08,369
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the family called Santa's um we can</font>

577
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:12,539
search hey give me all the files that

578
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:14,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">has a version string in the parameter</font>

579
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:17,549
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> name which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again occurs due to</font>

580
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:20,399
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> P file with the specific name</font>

581
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:22,320
just give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of that so we're not</font>

582
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,149
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about hashes and talking about</font>

583
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,668
anything I which is talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

584
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:29,129
characteristics other files giving all

585
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:31,409
that so again we're trying to walk away

586
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:37,678
from firebase hash and going after

587
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:41,700
characteristics and another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you</font>

588
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:44,789
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> this amazing research for for you</font>

know for ESET or even tie was from

590
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:51,210
Symantec you say you know stand next is

591
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,919
using these functions to hook into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

594
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,320
search for hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> give me exact labels that</font>

595
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,440
this piece of the strings that we know

596
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">is ipi there is no reference in the</font>

597
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,730

598
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:17,009
string within the file give me all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

599

and tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> well giving all that them</font>

600
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:23,309
has the match and the match is this

601
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:25,379
string with that particular name that is

602
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:28,259
not reference in the import table and

603
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:33,619
you have right there is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred and</font>

604
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:37,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">three different versions of stomachs</font>

00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:43,739
want to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in that way so we put</font>

607
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:45,539
you know all this we make it you know

608
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:48,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">the interface would make it as easy as</font>

609
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:51,570
possible tomorrow hunters to use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

610
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:55,259
start processing files to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

611
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:58,590
achieve that we actually we have private

612
00:30:55,259 --> 00:31:01,320
access to some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest my word on</font>

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:08,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">kit deloitte and so with this is there's</font>

615
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,279
this a place called apt notes which

616
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:11,639
collects all the reports from different

617

AP

618
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:18,810
the actors across the years it has 11

619
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:21,510
years right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now ypg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actors and we got</font>

620
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:24,210
all the hashes all the files on hash all

621
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:26,850
the files we've got all the hatches from

622
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:31,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> three boards we click on them all</font>

623
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:33,959
those files for all those reports and we

624
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:39,870
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in as Sibbett put in a file and</font>

625
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:41,940
we have loaded to our to our get so

626
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:45,300
everybody can actually download it is

627
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,340
seven thousand files I start processing

628
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,860
those fire which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a click in low</font>

629
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and let sit in process the file it takes</font>

630
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,479
time of course and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start</font>

631
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">searching and doing some stuff for</font>

634
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,300
know the beauty of this of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

636
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:11,820
research and we counter that there was

637
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:15,990
nothing like quite likely the way we

638
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,700
want it and well we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build it and</font>

639
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,790
might as well just share it to the worst

640
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,310
people can process file process malware

641
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:25,200
or pursue sometimes boot files to

642
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:27,960
determine what it's all the files<font color="#CCCCCC"> mower</font>

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,490
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say press</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the good files an</font>

644
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,530
example for the Bangladesh hack we had

645
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,840
the file we had the back language

646
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,240
malware and we knew that we have the

647
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,439
file because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> searched for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

648
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,120
regional VL because within our system it

649
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,230
seems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone actually upload the</font>

650
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,629
Swift some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swift the files so we</font>

651
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,940
knew the names of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpi I've been</font>

652
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:58,320
called by the malware and we put those

653
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:02,070
names hey the malware who was there so

654
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:05,639
again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you can go there clone it</font>

655
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:07,679
and if you want to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> just help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

656
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,480
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of help and make it better</font>

657
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:14,850
please let's help us to make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

658
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:17,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think have a few minutes we create</font>

659
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:21,030
also a twitter twitter account so you

660
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:24,180
can over there you can ask one of us to

661
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:25,649
provide the apt password for the save

662
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,350
file that contains seven

663
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:30,510
a roughly 7,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour we just don't give</font>

664
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:34,050
away because it's a kind of danger so

665
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:36,180
you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> dear message me or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever in</font>

666
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:38,070
the team<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will send you it will give</font>

667
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:42,000
you the password and if you want to

668
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow the twitter we post</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes we</font>

669
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,380
do my<font color="#CCCCCC"> where similarity so last week it</font>

670
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:53,100
was a malware type from think the people

671
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,860
from Symantec what's called old enough

672
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:58,500
or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and remember now</font>

673
00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:01,409
so they turn out that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the files</font>

674
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,350
that we process within our database we

675
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:07,020
actually have more than the actual

676
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:09,449
report from Symantec and that's actually

677
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:13,500
we say wait this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of strange how</font>

678
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:15,569
come this guy have more is because

679
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,969
sometimes we have files<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some other</font>

680
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,470
vendor doesn't have its semantics it

681
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:21,750
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all this prayer circle of</font>

682
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:23,279
the world it's not just then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

683
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,590
everybody out here in the antivirus

684
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,260
industry so if they don't see a file

685
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:31,260
they cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> caster the file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way</font>

686
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do sometimes we get lucky and we</font>

687
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,700
have one file that they know how so we

688
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,339
said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a this one has this</font>

689
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,678
percent of similarity you want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

690
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">had the file to the clustering again and</font>

691
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,700
maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one more hash to be</font>

692
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:47,520
published<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the website so we do that</font>

693
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:50,250
again for<font color="#CCCCCC"> free which is not no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

694
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,649
just this do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our clients so</font>

695
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:55,889
again this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter account if you</font>

696
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:57,509
have questions I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

697
00:34:55,889 --> 00:35:01,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't I'm sure I don't have all the</font>

698
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:04,760
answers but I will try so thank you

699
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,760
Christmas

700
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:30,840
thanks for the talk you talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

701
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,850
hovels generation yeah and when we

702
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,520
select multiple mad whales do you try to

703
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:37,770
generate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minimum set of rules or</font>

704
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,840
to just<font color="#CCCCCC"> generate a wider I of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

705
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,720
that will catch everything but the

706
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,820
turbot<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the minimum set we use we</font>

707
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:50,660
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reinvent the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rule so we</font>

708
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:54,240
use our<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand so that uses you know has a</font>

709
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:57,930
four hundred megabyte database of known

710
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,609
ipi so this card all that it goes after

711
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,609
you know some of the strings even in

712
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">unicode and also do cooperation so you</font>

713
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,840
have you might have depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the fact</font>

714
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,850
that you want to compare what they call

715
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:15,360
