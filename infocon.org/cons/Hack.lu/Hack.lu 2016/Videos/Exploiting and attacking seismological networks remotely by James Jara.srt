1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:12,510
okay hi guys index talk we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,980
talk about how to remotely exploit and

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:19,380
attack on seismological networks so

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,320
disclaimer before the talk is all bull

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,710
abilities until report to the US and

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,349
Europe<font color="#CCCCCC"> cert to avoid any issue legal</font>

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,720
problems and this is very important that

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,840
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not responsible of any action</font>

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,210
that anyone here can take off straight

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,000
and in this talk because we also we are

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,199
providing the source code to exploit all

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,929
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> zoological networks so what we are</font>

13
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:48,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">not talking about on the motivation and</font>

14
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:51,480
the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hand this research</font>

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,699
basic introduction to system illogical

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,498
networks to understand better all

17
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,739
elements and topology of the network

18
00:00:55,499 --> 00:01:00,809
they impact and then we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the</font>

19
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,370
t-mo about the attack on<font color="#E5E5E5"> penetration</font>

20
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:09,810
inside the network this research<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:15,000
been done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Burton burpees which is</font>

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:17,729
in the a dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 in Chile right now myself</font>

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,070
you see my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is James</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> djarum we have</font>

24
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:24,950
been at the DEF CON black hat echo

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,869
parian several international conference

26
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,670
we are from Costa Rica I don't know if

27
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,759
you know where it is located but this is

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:37,399
America as in drugs this is Latin

29
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:41,250
America we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small small country</font>

30
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:43,469
yeah it's not Puerto Rico because

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,920
everybody thinks Costa Rica is berto

32
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:51,179
Rico but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so which is the</font>

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,659
motivation behind this research well an

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,289
average attacker is not interested

35
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">because this is like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a scientific topic</font>

36
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:02,909
so also<font color="#E5E5E5"> because these are cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

37
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">scenario and this means that these</font>

38
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,310
devices are located maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the polar</font>

39
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:14,970
cap hundreds of meters under the ocean

40
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,530
so if you denial of service<font color="#CCCCCC"> over I'll</font>

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,160
these devices

42
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be pretty expensive to a company to</font>

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,290
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work again also the school leads</font>

44
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,470
into a financial sabotage to a specific

45
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:34,670
companies or countries so that's it that

46
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,230
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why the average attacker is not</font>

47
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:41,329
interested this is more so kind of

48
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google government stock or red team's</font>

49
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,900
this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of this is mecom</font>

50
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,518
volcanic activity over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world so</font>

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:54,360
basically we have sensors over all the

52
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:57,750
world there are a lot basics<font color="#CCCCCC"> isma logic</font>

53
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,840
terms which is the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:05,519
seismic network is basically record the

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,620
earthquakes movements and waves they

56
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,390
want to find the location of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> air</font>

57
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:15,209
quakes they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure the games</font>

58
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:17,579
calculate the magnitude also they<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

59
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,220
be processing and storing all these data

60
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,670
in different at concision servers across

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,100
the world this is one where certain

62
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,869
instruments<font color="#E5E5E5"> danisha the wave of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">earth so they're common applications are</font>

64
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,600
earthquake detection freaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dealer</font>

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:43,170
for oil and gas recovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> except or</font>

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:46,200
analysis of the earth mine safety this

67
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:49,290
is life is very important because the

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,858
sensors works also for oil and gas

69
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,828
recovery so there are companies that use

70
00:03:52,859 --> 00:04:02,430
the same sensors for earthquake sections

71
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:06,260
in the research of oil and gas this is

72
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:10,230
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are really small and</font>

73
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:13,970
we have the broadband sensor we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

74
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">salam accelerometer and the geophone</font>

75
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:21,209
which at the Bender's in this space we

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a lot of vendors but nano matrix is</font>

77
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,669
claims to be the number one in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

78
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:30,210
industry and then we have the group

79
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:36,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">system or research is on top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

80
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to vendors the internal of each device</font>

81
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,880
the internals they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> an linux-based</font>

82
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have a remote management system</font>

83
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:49,830
they have several services like ssh

84
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:53,160
telnet event ftp they have a web server

85
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:57,240
which is injury they have an accurate

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:03,090
gps system and they contains<font color="#CCCCCC"> a battery</font>

87
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:06,090
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least one year so what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> todos</font>

88
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,340
terrace is a portable digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco</font>

89
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,820
graph because we have the sensor which

90
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:17,280
connect to the towers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> tyrell sends</font>

91
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:19,830
the data to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the acquisition server this</font>

92
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how it looks their deployment which</font>

93
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:27,210
is pretty simple and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ocean water</font>

94
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:34,590
deployment which is complex we are

95
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:37,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about deployment of one month we</font>

96
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:40,169
have a deaf butter which is the

97
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:44,639
marketing leader of nano metrics who

98
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:47,549
claims the instruments malfunctions

99
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,330
wherever it's in the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ocean</font>

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> last forever so if they don't work</font>

102
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,250
for all this one second they will lost

103
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,539
the data forever there is not another

104
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:07,050
way to recovery this is how the looks

105
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:09,180
the topology of pathologic networks we

106
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,240
have as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before this is moment</font>

107
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:16,349
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sensor and sends the data to</font>

108
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital portable and deeds will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

109
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:22,020
sending the data to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> acquisition</font>

110
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:26,090
server so inferior we will see how to

111
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:29,070
execute a man-in-the-middle attack holes

112
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:33,210
there is an organization in<font color="#CCCCCC"> search of</font>

113
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:35,669
all related to this political neighbors

114
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,460
which is the international federation of

115
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:41,250
digital system<font color="#CCCCCC"> agra they have out</font>

116
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,239
several books and reference manual will

117
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:48,020
help us to understand how it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

118
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,120
network especially the seat manual which

119
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,520
is the most important because this is

120
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,349
the protocol that they are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

121
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:01,250
exchange the data so talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

122
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:03,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">little the impact on on the real war we</font>

123
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:07,009
discovery that these devices are located

124
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:09,469
in any part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world but they have a</font>

125
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:12,830
lack of security in all sense so

126
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:17,360
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the different points of</font>

127
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:21,099
failure are vulnerable so I have a

128
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,009
question here what if an earthquake

129
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:27,979
we're checking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the city of Madrid and</font>

130
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:31,909
even being a hugs this will be having an

131
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:34,940
impact of the economic of the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

132
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:37,490
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible right now we have</font>

133
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">another example which is involved a lot</font>

134
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money what if the company modifies</font>

135
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:47,810
the sensors of other company which is

136
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:51,229
researching specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space we</font>

137
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:55,669
which have oil and gas that is a

138
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:59,120
possible environment also and this one

139
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:02,060
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a more critical and what if a</font>

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,409
data consistent servers contains<font color="#E5E5E5"> faked</font>

141
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:09,139
data corrupted data so we are wondering

142
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">if the predictions will fail because we</font>

143
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:13,940
have an example here<font color="#E5E5E5"> here about the</font>

144
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,479
scientific is who get<font color="#CCCCCC"> jailed because</font>

145
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:21,319
they did not predict correctly another

146
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,080
quake so what happen if the data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

147
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:28,509
acquisition servers get corrupted<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

148
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,919
this cool having so yeah to stalk

149
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:34,039
basically this political networks are

150
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:38,029
pretty big so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have tried to give you</font>

151
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">an idea about the different elements so</font>

152
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:44,390
we are going to attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> them penetration</font>

153
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,640
all the system basically how the process

154
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,529
of printing how we discovered these

155
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,529
devices so let's see

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:10,170
we are using LED TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> I 0 which is an IOT</font>

157
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:18,480
search engine is root 3 so anyone can

158
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:20,969
try this is different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> challan which</font>

159
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,399
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alvis in syntax we have query</font>

160
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:27,360
builder syntax which is very easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

161
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:30,350
we have several operators<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ssl</font>

162
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,200
operators especially on<font color="#E5E5E5"> geolocation</font>

163
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:39,140
operators<font color="#CCCCCC"> but for this case we will use</font>

164
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:43,279
headers which the key will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sober and</font>

165
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,279
the value will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> terrace</font>

166
00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:01,550
so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results of this query</font>

167
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:04,490
as we can see they are locating here

168
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,170
from here so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we discover</font>

169
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,959
these devices and we have many

170
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,300
fingerprints that we can get to see what

171
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,229
what contains as you can see here<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

172
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:20,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">little is visible we have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jury the</font>

173
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:20,589
line looks and different fingerprints

174
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:39,160
so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see that is how we find the</font>

175
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:41,380
tablet devices but this is from the UI

176
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,689
we have on a script which will be

177
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:47,770
provided to anyone which will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

180
00:10:51,640 --> 00:11:01,540
of the world so as I say contains Jerry

182
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:07,240
execute anything we want also we get the

183
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,480
field where how we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we're looking</font>

184
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,210

an email to the nemetrix an order

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:21,460
vendors um I don't know why they the

187
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:24,340
replying or email with the finger that's

188
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy but we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the finger so you get</font>

a study<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hubbard the finger but one week</font>

190
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,080
later we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> another email from nano</font>

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">matrix this case which says nanometric</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll deceit reference manual is very</font>

198
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,709
important because this is only way we

199
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:02,969
can reproduce the package which is the

200
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:06,550
standard of exchange of earthquake data

201
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:09,520
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit protocol how do you work the SIP</font>

202
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:13,209
protocol we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have four sectors the first</font>

203
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,880
one didn't work out the station<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

204
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:18,970
because we can have several devices in

205
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:25,450
the same sector a location ID and

206
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:27,820
channel coach also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for group system is</font>

207
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:31,500
pretty easy to find these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices using</font>

208
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:36,270
again LED TV but looking inside the

209
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,270
certificate ssl metadata

210
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:45,529
and this is a not that common<font color="#CCCCCC"> quarry but</font>

211
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:48,170
it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to search data inside</font>

212
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:50,750
the certificates for the case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chillon</font>

213
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:53,479
is available<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll also need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be so</font>

214
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,120
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool to search rather than</font>

215
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,389
busca de looking of the headers looking

216
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:02,389
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the certificates so with which</font>

217
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:06,620
tools we<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to start looking what</font>

218
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:08,449
services has each each device we have on

219
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,029
the script which collects the IP so

220
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:14,089
worldwide that is one and we have fun

221
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:20,589
under the scripts will be a scanning all

222
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:20,589
the parts of each device so let's see

223
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,250
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty simple as you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

224
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:44,100
we are looking over shut down and they

225
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:47,160
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different scripts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an ATV on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

226
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:54,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">hang alerts so this will be create a</font>

227
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:57,959
file then we will use as can devices and

228
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,740
this will be just our map looking for

229
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:05,719
each IP and will return<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the option</font>

230
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,720
parts of each IP

231
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:22,550
so we can see here on output of all I

232
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:28,090
piece which is are a lot of hype is so

233
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:28,089
all this appease our only tablet devices

234
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:35,720
and this is a friend of Costa Rica which

235
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:41,300
is helping us to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end map</font>

236
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:44,690
devices maybe you know who is so

237
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,540
basically which are the common parts we

238
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:51,590
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the surface of telnet</font>

239
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:54,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">SSH and HTTP server we have also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n</font>

240
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,920
script to get an image about our highly

241
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:02,599
looks all these devices so we have

242
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:04,640
worldwide map contains all<font color="#CCCCCC"> continuous</font>

243
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">all all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> screenshots of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

244
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:16,880
application and let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you how to</font>

245
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:24,260
hide looks so this is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> he looks at</font>

246
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:28,070
out this device yeah is that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

247
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:38,810
pretty simple we have graphics about HUD

248
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:41,960
HUD what is happening the waves etc also

249
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:45,349
we execute fussing web technique however

250
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jerry server and it crashed it crash</font>

251
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,900
out which because this devices dozen

252
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,540
contains too much memory and which is

253
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:56,540
very sad very sad javaserver it's pretty

254
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,020
easy to crush<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they have a lot of</font>

255
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:04,000
information disclosure issues every word

256
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,000
this doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of security</font>

257
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,780
going back to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> where analysis we</font>

258
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,470
had cell looking for the root password

259
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,890
inside the files and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decoded we have</font>

260
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:19,640
also discovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> a back door there is not</font>

261
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:22,100
an official user documented which is

262
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,350
called factory as you can see here in

263
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,170
the image we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> central text and user</font>

264
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,400
the factory is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not documented in any</font>

265
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,770
place

266
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:36,350
anywhere of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> documentation of nano</font>

267
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:39,020
metrics so everyone can use it also when

268
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,300
we get inside the system of any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

269
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:46,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">device essential come auto kind of</font>

270
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,839
vulnerabilities and available the idea

271
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,630
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a malicious users protect</font>

272
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:55,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">perfected to protect your data what is</font>

273
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:58,010
it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> we always say to all the vendors</font>

274
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,350
because we can now execute a

275
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,380
man-in-the-middle attack so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

276
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,380
you

277
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:19,410
for this case we have a video because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

278
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:22,290
cannot execute this and real because

279
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:29,640
cold will cool it into any legal problem

280
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:33,330
so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend sent me this video yeah so</font>

281
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,900
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> on going to the streaming option</font>

282
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:39,659
for this case this could be by a script

283
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:46,800
but for presentation purpose we are

284
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:50,640
doing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front and each device has</font>

285
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:53,419
the exactly position in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world so we</font>

286
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,420
are looking for

287
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,500
you

288
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:08,880
so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see this device is in the</font>

289
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle of the ocean</font>

290
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,100
you

291
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:45,360
the video is is lovely<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there you</font>

292
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:48,290
have this is near to here and now we are

293
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:53,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to the settings of the device</font>

294
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,690
especially to the configuration

295
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:24,810
so we are going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data streaming</font>

296
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,810
options we will assign you<font color="#E5E5E5"> dps reveal so</font>

297
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:32,250
as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know which this is using UDP will</font>

298
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:39,110
be pretty easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do IP spoofing also we</font>

299
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:44,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going to add a new streamer we are</font>

300
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:49,679
setting or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a target IP this is an</font>

301
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,510
observer destination server so now we

302
00:19:49,680 --> 00:20:06,090
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the destination server and we</font>

303
00:19:51,510 --> 00:20:07,560
will start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting all the data so as</font>

304
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:14,000
you can see we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting all the</font>

305
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:14,000
packets this is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> n/p format</font>

306
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:32,359
and now we are redirecting the data of

307
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:34,909
course we are not presenting this data

308
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:37,309
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data acquisition circle because</font>

309
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:41,960
this will lead into a very big issue

310
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:45,109
right so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the package</font>

311
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,129
sang taek's plane there is nothing using

312
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:52,070
SSL communication or anything like that

313
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:55,099
there they are not out<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ating</font>

314
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:58,789
the data also so you can set up right

315
00:20:55,099 --> 00:21:02,979
now here fake device and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they start</font>

316
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,979
sending data to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> acquisition server</font>

317
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:22,658
so basically the protocol works like

318
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,970
this is not real this is just a visual

319
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:28,390
propers but they have sent in latex

320
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:31,000
latitude longitude and altitude so we

321
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:38,020
can modify all this data pretty simple

322
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:40,150
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a spoofy for example so I at</font>

323
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,490
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have on the script which will</font>

324
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,860
connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each IP and will execute any</font>

325
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:48,490
comment this will be doing in a massive

326
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:52,570
exploiting way so for this we recommend

327
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:54,970
to disable your ssh holds a key shaking

328
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:58,149
feature and then you will need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

329
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:02,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">an IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> txt file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with all the pieces and</font>

330
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:04,799
execute parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssh zeros so for</font>

331
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">example we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can execute all these</font>

332
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:14,250
examples for shell shock you name to see

333
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:18,580
which server is we call or even opping a

334
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:23,100
reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSH or even use a framework to</font>

335
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,100
end do anything inside so

336
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:40,229
so for example as you can see here this

337
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:44,190
screen you need the parameter with the

338
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:48,440
text it is the eyepiece and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment</font>

339
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,440
so we will execute your name

340
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:07,820
so there is or any comments possible

341
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,020
I am executing this over one single IP

342
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,409
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to make anything to</font>

343
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,410
the network

344
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,210
well something songs sometimes fails

345
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:48,540
that is the Karma because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I know why</font>

346
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:01,410
well that's just another example we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

347
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:06,830
execute any kind of comment to the all

348
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,830
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with within a single comma</font>

349
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:19,439
and the code is pretty simple is we are

350
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:23,070
using parallel<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSN clients so um I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

351
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:27,810
release all this source code but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

352
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:30,360
not releasing the password so if you

353
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:32,070
want get the finger start the password

354
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,639
and that's it so you can see in this

355
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:38,220
line we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are reading the password from</font>

356
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,080
other file to avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> any kind of leaking</font>

357
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:45,900
this information because this is pretty

358
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:48,929
sensitive so at the end we execute a

359
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:52,260
clean a clean comment overall the

360
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:57,540
network just to you know avoid any

361
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:59,879
problems so conclusions and we were able

362
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:03,960
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> locate this device anywhere in the</font>

363
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:07,440
world also we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in control of the</font>

364
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:12,000
device this is one mirror and the data

365
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:16,050
acquisition server basically anything

366
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,830
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure there is not ssl</font>

367
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:22,409
communications over the data finally

368
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendor splits called better and thinking</font>

369
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:29,990
security that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks a lot the</font>

370
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,990
presentation

371
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's 15 minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left so any questions</font>

372
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,720
it seems the web interface is not

373
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,840
authenticated or did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

374
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">backdoor user for the web UDP adding the</font>

375
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:07,939
streamer for the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of in this case is</font>

376
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:12,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">not authenticated but well in this case</font>

377
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:15,830
it is or look<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay only not but as you</font>

378
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:18,710
can see in the in the image that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

379
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:21,949
in the last slide they are showing all

380
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:25,540
the template users so we can use any any

381
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:30,760
of them for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example we have central and</font>

382
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,760
this is a pencil central is the password

383
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:40,100
so does it and you can login so you can

384
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:49,610
see we are inside my unsuccessful<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

385
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:52,159
thanks welcome any other questions do

386
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:55,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know if these devices I've been used</font>

387
00:26:52,160 --> 00:27:00,290
in recent de dos attacks against obvious

388
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:03,680
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a common question but we can</font>

389
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:08,360
do a do that but they are not good

390
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:11,480
strong for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> task because in fact you</font>

391
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,209
can set the target IP four and streaming

392
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,280
and if you control a fair number of

393
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,500
these devices and point to the same

394
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:22,100
target they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive a huge amount</font>

395
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:28,090
of publix and the details against Josh

396
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:28,090
was probably this kind of attack here

397
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:34,700
well the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these devices are</font>

398
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:38,350
not to a strong to create a de dos

399
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:42,830
attack so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will work</font>

400
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:46,699
they are like they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough</font>

401
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:49,730
memory you can do added us over a single

402
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">device and he will die soon as possible</font>

403
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:57,260
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a question actually could</font>

404
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,420
determine the attacker

405
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:03,740
brick all of these devices remotely at

406
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:07,940
scale if they can a break home devices

407
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:10,310
at the same time yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course with this</font>

408
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,740
script they can do it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if all</font>

409
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:15,740
these devices are in the ocean bottom

410
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:18,650
and you create on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the script</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

411
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,710
will disconnect the interface that's it

412
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:27,230
everything will be disconnected<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

413
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:29,150
means a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money all</font>

414
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,920
right if no further questions let's say

415
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,920
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to James thank you</font>
