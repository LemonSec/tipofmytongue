1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:09,780
thank you hello my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is Martin boss</font>

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,879
slit and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present a tool to you</font>

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,560
that we are currently developing it's

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">about secure emails</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,029
everybody in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> is at least</font>

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,000
familiar with ssl<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps and probably has</font>

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,800
also used<font color="#E5E5E5"> it before and this makes a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,739
of sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is a really helpful</font>

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,320
tool it allows you to check web servers

10
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:36,090
your own web servers or maybe you're a

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,160
banking side and the problem is are not

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,589
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem it's restricted to</font>

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,428
https so it's perfectly fine for web

14
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:46,469
servers but we thought hey why not have

15
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,300
the same thing for email<font color="#E5E5E5"> because right</font>

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">now we don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good tool that</font>

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:57,599
allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check our email providers</font>

18
00:00:51,809 --> 00:01:00,300
and on top of just what ssl apps gives

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,210
us so TLS analysis we also would like to

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,179
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the DNS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> record</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up because</font>

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,079
there are dns records that are really

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,979
critical for<font color="#E5E5E5"> email security think of SPF</font>

23
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:17,070
dekum<font color="#CCCCCC"> demark and so on so what we want</font>

24
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,890
is a combination of basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl apps</font>

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,869
plus something like a mix tool box that

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,530
allows you to look into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> record</font>

27
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:28,890
set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this tool should be able to</font>

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,130
talk all email relevant protocols so for

29
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,590
sending smtp for receiving pop and imap

30
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it should allow us to deal with</font>

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,180
either start you less when you're

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,479
upgrading an unencrypted connection or

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,049
if the services are encrypted by default

34
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:50,630
this should all work out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box so</font>

35
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:53,549
in a yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come to summarize we want</font>

36
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:57,869
all in one comfort tool for analyzing

37
00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:00,179
email security we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> developed a proof</font>

38
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,340
of concept for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and the intention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

39
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:05,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">to release this to the public as a tool</font>

40
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,640
for free it's implemented using open

41
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:10,829
source software so the back end is

42
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,900
implemented in rails<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 and all the</font>

43
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">front-end assets are</font>

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,540
managed by gulp now to say this upfront

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know that there's a lot of criticism</font>

46
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,600
going on whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ca system in</font>

47
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,840
general is secure if TLS is the perfect

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,910
protocol they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are not</font>

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to fix this so that's not all</font>

50
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,790
goal we just want to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool to</font>

51
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,070
so you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to analyze the</font>

52
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,170
features that are available today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

53
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,880
you know you're using them correctly or

54
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,859
you can see if there's any problems with

55
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,530
them let's have a quick look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool</font>

56
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,740
it's a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface much like ssl</font>

57
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,260
apps you enter a host name you specify

58
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,820
the protocol that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test and</font>

59
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,429
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something other than the</font>

60
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">default port then you can also specify</font>

61
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:07,060
an additional port and this is taken

62
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,549
from the results page so it's much like

63
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,780
what you would expect we have a section

64
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:17,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS here's an example with dane</font>

65
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,920
records and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Teela's a record sorry and</font>

66
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:23,490
you have a section for TLS analyzing the

67
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,170
GLS set up the ciphers and so on so

68
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:30,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what you already know</font>

69
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,690
from ssl apps and as well as the

70
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,390
certificates so you have to serve a

71
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:39,220
certificate chain and it would tell you

72
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:41,920
this certificate is valid and so on now

73
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,200
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed this proof of concept</font>

74
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
but we are now entering the next place

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,260
we want to release this to the public

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,410
and we want to develop further features

77
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,410
one important feature that we want to

78
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement is we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to acknowledge the</font>

79
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,450
a synchronicity of emails so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

80
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,030
allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply send an email to the</font>

81
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:09,220
service and after the checks are done it

82
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:13,270
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> reply to you with the result and or</font>

83
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:17,529
a link including<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out to the result</font>

84
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:20,440
page now to see this through we need

85
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">more support we need your support we</font>

86
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,390
also need funding the proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concept</font>

87
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,169
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been funded by the Ministry of</font>

88
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,940
Commerce

89
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,610
and this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of our current</font>

90
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,740
sponsors but we would also really

91
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,510
welcome anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who wants to get</font>

92
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,910

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop or if you want to integrate</font>
