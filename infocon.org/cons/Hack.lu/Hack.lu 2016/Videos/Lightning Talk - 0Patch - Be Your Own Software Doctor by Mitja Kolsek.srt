1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:13,690
okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm guessing from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the from the</font>

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,730
color of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> shirts mostly that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,619
guys know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the world we live</font>

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,269
in so full of vulnerabilities everywhere

5
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:24,249
and also i'm guessing that many of you

6
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:26,650
are security researchers finding bugs

7
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:29,380
anyone found bugs in someone else's code

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,179
please don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be shy I know you all have</font>

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,129
and those who haven't tried maybe

10
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:36,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't raised their hands but it's so</font>

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,740
easy now as a researcher you have maybe

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,440
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky that the vendor of the</font>

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,510
vulnerable software has a bug bounty

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,690
program but if they don't then you are

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,120
faced with a very painful dilemma which

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,250
is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to report this to the vendor</font>

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,290
and we know that well all hell could

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,650
break loose if you do that or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can</font>

19
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:58,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">be you can be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky you can just go</font>

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,449
full disclosure and hope for the best

21
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,750
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then justify that in all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ways</font>

22
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of you can sell it to well</font>

23
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,010
and then hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> not read the news so</font>

24
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,560
you don't know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability</font>

25
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,150
was being used for or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just</font>

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,770
forget about it so none of these options

27
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">are really very good for you and in case</font>

28
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,270
that the vulnerability that you found

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually got to the vendor and vendor</font>

30
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,658
apply I mean created a security update

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,710
that security update is very likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

32
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:34,659
not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been installed yet why because</font>

33
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,240
official vendor updates look pretty much

34
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,979
like if you go to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you say</font>

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,509
my knee<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurts a little bit what can you</font>

36
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:43,030
do something about it and the doctor

37
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">says of course I will just replace your</font>

38
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,860
entire leg and give you a different one

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,110
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't hurt that might work for</font>

40
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,950
doctors I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I wouldn't let them but</font>

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:57,400
case in<font color="#CCCCCC"> point last patch tuesday if you</font>

42
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,950
had windows 7 64 bit system and you

43
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,070
applied just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security only updates</font>

44
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:07,540
which is new thing now they fix 31

45
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:10,959
vulnerabilities and they replaced 232

46
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:14,680
megabytes of code on your system i'll

47
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,710
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sink in so 232 megabytes well</font>

48
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,380
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

49
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:21,380
most of it was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same source code but</font>

50
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,470
who knows what the compiler compiled now

51
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,390
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a big reason why well end users</font>

52
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,260
may may apply their updates immediately

53
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,700
but corporations and and enterprises

54
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,250
don't do that because too many times

55
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">things have broken and they go into</font>

56
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,870
testing so they test and test and test

57
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,780
and while the tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tests and tests</font>

58
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:45,440
attackers attack and attack and attack

59
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:48,650
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know one of</font>

60
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the recent researches has shown that in</font>

61
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,050
the united states the financial

62
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,540
corporations take on average half a year

63
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,610
to apply official updates which is kind

64
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of good times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> force for attackers i mean</font>

65
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm a pen tester to it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like cool</font>

66
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,220
it's easier to break into networks today

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,650
than it was years ago because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i</font>

68
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,310
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go to paste bin or or anywhere</font>

69
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:14,600
to find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> find an exploit and just go in</font>

70
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,880
and and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do admins fear applying</font>

71
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,359
updates immediately that's because it

72
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:23,450
it's risky they can break things and

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">also they need to interrupt their users</font>

74
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,399
unless they do it at<font color="#CCCCCC"> night and of course</font>

75
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">if something goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong it's very very</font>

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,990
difficult to correct things and get back

77
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,680
to yesterday when you were vulnerable

78
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:38,090
but things were<font color="#E5E5E5"> still working so</font>

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,750
patching is clearly a software problem

80
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:44,360
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does one do if you want to if</font>

81
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,920
one wants to fix a software problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

82
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,350
think it's obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> you create more</font>

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,420
software right and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did we</font>

84
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,400
created more software and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

85
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,170
created more vulnerabilities but who

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,410
cares let let's look at what what the

87
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,280
software does now what the software does

88
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:03,460
in trying to fix this huge software not

89
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,290
fix is not being applied problem is

90
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,860
nothing really<font color="#E5E5E5"> spectacular we're just</font>

91
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:12,109
using the what every antivirus is doing

92
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,300
everyone who's doing anything with

93
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,790
hooking function hooking and it's been

94
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,310
done for decades<font color="#E5E5E5"> so nothing new here but</font>

95
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,530
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say we put some steroids in</font>

96
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,850
there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can patch anywhere in</font>

97
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,549
the code instead of just at the

98
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,560
beginning of functions now let's let's

99
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,680
say we have a vulnerability here and and

100
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,400
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

101
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,130
fix to add some code to correct the

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,138
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem so it goes away so we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

103
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,539
inject the patch code<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this call</font>

104
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,490
that we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and we see this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

105
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">basic hooking we see that these</font>

106
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,780
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> instructions are relocatable</font>

107
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,270
to somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in memory and that is</font>

108
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,419
exactly what we do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> relocate those</font>

109
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,820
original code instructions somewhere

110
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,130
else and we put the patch code before

111
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,990
them and then we jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the patch from</font>

112
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,330
the original location and then we return

113
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the patch code back so it's just</font>

114
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,258
basic stuff everyone's doing it so we're

115
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it as well and it's it's time</font>

116
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:09,780
tested but what we just did here is we

117
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,289
patched a vulnerability and we did it

118
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:17,758
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok flickering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool can we patch</font>

119
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:19,740
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we did this without restarting a</font>

120
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,419
computer and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> without relaunching</font>

121
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,169
the process that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were fixing so it's</font>

122
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:28,620
just hot applying a patch now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

123
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:32,310
sample patch source code basically what

124
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,860
you need to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok add offset</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X I</font>

125
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,440
want to put these additional machine

126
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,180
instructions so I can fix this for our

127
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,310
bill it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple for instance if</font>

128
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,169
you have a buffer overflow what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

129
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,120
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do what the</font>

130
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,310
original programmer forgot to do he

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,289
forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check for the length of input</font>

132
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,150
so you do that you check<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the length</font>

133
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:53,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">of input if it's too long you cut it</font>

134
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,840
short or you do some other corrective

135
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,030
actions but just cutting it short just

136
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,789
putting a null byte at the end to cut it

137
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,820
short<font color="#CCCCCC"> and let the original code flow</font>

138
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:04,979
through and that's that's a fix there

139
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:10,849
now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual fix for an old</font>

140
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:15,180
player bug very simple now basically

141
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:17,340
good news is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can fix basically</font>

142
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,620
any critical remote code execution

143
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,130
because most of all most of them are

144
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,690
memory corruptions right so we can we

145
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,969
can fix double fries user to freeze

146
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,900
numerical under flows and check buffers

147
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:36,090
and so on and if you read yesterday some

148
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:38,609
guys came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a new exploit pipe for</font>

149
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:42,270
flash bugs it's called use after

150
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,720
use-after-free cool you can fix that too

151
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:48,719
no idea what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is now this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

152
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,970
you guys come in right you guys look

153
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,760
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crowd to me and also you guys</font>

154
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,260
look like you could patch why because if

155
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,270
you have ever found a vulnerability in

156
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,250
software you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> created</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an X point of</font>

157
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,140
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the fun part creating an</font>

158
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,490
exploit so he can show what can be done

159
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the vulnerability that you found</font>

160
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,150
you can also create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a patch there's</font>

161
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,830
that's the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> skill set that you need</font>

162
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:14,429
and this is what we're envisioning so

163
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,560
we're a small company and we cannot

164
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,840
create all the patches that that the

165
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,670
world needs but together with you and

166
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,310
with with all the other security

167
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,260
researchers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can become possible so</font>

168
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,880
what we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically we created</font>

169
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:32,730
a machine that allows you to patch stuff

170
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:38,490
sorry white white people I'm sorry just

171
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:40,530
the same that's the same guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

172
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,320
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic idea it's very simple a</font>

173
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:46,080
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security researchers finding a</font>

174
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of vulnerabilities and reversing a</font>

175
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,659
lot of patches from official vendor

176
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:54,840
updates and then putting them all in

177
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,970
that gray box which then distributes

178
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,520
that to millions and millions<font color="#CCCCCC"> millions</font>

179
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of users does that sound nice well you</font>

180
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,440
can be part of that I'm hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

181
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,630
of you will be now what we're trying to

182
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:14,460
do is turn this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation that we</font>

183
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:16,290
have today into this so where are we at

184
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an open beta for</font>

185
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,510
windows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can feel free to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try welcome</font>

186
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,330
to and give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback we have a proof</font>

187
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,490
of concept for linux and working our way

188
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:30,630
towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

189
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:33,510
hoping to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop the the hell that</font>

190
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,120
that's waiting is there we have a proof

191
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,799
concept for mac and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about to</font>

192
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,929
ship the zero patch factor which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

193
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,229
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple tool that that makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy</font>

194
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,880
for you to create patches so I'm hoping

195
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,900
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least will</font>

196
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,520
start start considering creating patches

197
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,240
just at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least for yourselves if you have</font>

198
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,730
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour or four</font>

199
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,670
