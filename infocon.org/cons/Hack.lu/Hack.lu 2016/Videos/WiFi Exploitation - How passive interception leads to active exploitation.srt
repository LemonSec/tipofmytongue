1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:10,889
ready to go so present Solomon<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sonia</font>

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thanks well hello everyone my name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,448
Solomon<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sonia and thank you very much</font>

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,850
for coming to our talk here on Wi-Fi

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,550
exploitation how passive interception

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,650
can lead to active exploitation so

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,840
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be good well let's see</font>

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,840
here's what to expect in this

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,119
presentation walk around<font color="#E5E5E5"> some I'll wave</font>

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,770
my hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit and hopefully will</font>

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,480
cover most of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because</font>

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,829
I have an idea of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to talk</font>

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,540
about and usually we just get carried

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">away and whenever our Chris whenever</font>

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,360
Chris tells me to stop I'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sit</font>

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,690
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know we'll take questions</font>

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,160
at the end but one thing I do show here

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,260
is the live demonstration gremlin

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,000
because i know our previous presenters

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,579
book about live demos and the thing that

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,469
happens so many times is that you know

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,000
you have live demos prepared it works

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfectly in your office it works</font>

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,420
perfectly while you're sitting down

25
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting ready for the presentation but</font>

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">as soon as you do something like things</font>

27
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,640
crash so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does not happen</font>

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,090
today but if it does just bear with me

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and fix it as we move along</font>

30
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so Who am I I am an assistant</font>

31
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:15,020
professor at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US Air Force Academy I</font>

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,249
currently teach computer science

33
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,229
software security cyber security and

34
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:21,089
this year i also created a new course on

35
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,039
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and digital forensics so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

36
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,869
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like computer security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> itself I</font>

37
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:27,240
like dealing with cyber security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

38
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,709
cyber threats so hopefully you'll see

39
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,068
that trend and a lot of the research

40
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:35,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I choose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do now security at</font>

41
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:38,039
present I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider how far have</font>

42
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:39,598
we come and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much do we still have to</font>

43
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,689
go in terms of securing our computer

44
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,429
systems for tomorrow now one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

45
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,380
is usually common with a lot of our

46
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:48,719
security architectures and our security

47
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,289
implementation is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> still believe</font>

48
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,389
detection is the key and with detection

49
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:56,969
this makes all of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> accustomed to patch</font>

50
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:58,319
after discovery meaning as soon as we

51
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,149
find a vulnerability let's go ahead and

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,189
patch it at this point as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

53
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,590
vulnerability is known in the wild and

54
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">it could have a significant impact then</font>

55
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,220
we'll go ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> release a patch</font>

56
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,199
against it but unfortunately with this

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,730
paradigm not everything is patched that

58
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,649
needs to be patched not all

59
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,079
vulnerabilities that should be secured

60
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,910
are because maybe some it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might only</font>

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,030
fact two or three people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we just move</font>

62
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,590
on now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bad methodology and</font>

63
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,500
this methodology I also refer to as the

64
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,850
bolted on approach which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as I</font>

65
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,040
see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs to be done I'll</font>

66
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,260
go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fix it at that point even</font>

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,790
your antivirus programs dealing with

68
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,320
signatures as soon as we know that

69
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,690
there's a malware out there I release

70
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,930
the signature I hope it gets out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

71
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,670
world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we should be secure now we</font>

72
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,380
have new paradigms and protecting our

73
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,600
systems that go into baseline in which

74
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,980
your statistical anomaly intrusion

75
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,239
detection systems intrusion prevention

76
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,670
systems antivirus whether things or the

77
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,700
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these architectures fail</font>

78
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,859
with is I use it lies here in your

79
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,839
baselining such that you have to have a

80
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,580
good baseline if I do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a base a good</font>

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,080
base line that now I can detect based on

82
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,240
anomalies from that baseline duly signed

83
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,660
software all right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna tell a</font>

84
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,520
story about this so last year I was

85
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,930
challenged whenever I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

86
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,030
malware I especially like to write

87
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,709
malware in Java because i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fun</font>

88
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,739
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> java deploys on so many systems</font>

89
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,230
around an enterprise so i was told that

90
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,910
did you know that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> java and all</font>

91
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,709
these applications that you write will

92
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,650
no longer run anymore because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

93
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,780
not digitally signed thus as long as we

94
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,820
digitally signed a lot of our code then

95
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,470
all these other malware out there should

96
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,780
be irrelevant you know they should no

97
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,230
longer work and then said oh okay

98
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,940
challenge accepted so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am I went</font>

99
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,709
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bought a certificate so how do</font>

100
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,780
you buy a certificate I first hired a

101
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,510
lawyer and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I established my own</font>

102
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,250
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I went out and found</font>

103
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,959
who sells certificate signing

104
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,350
certificates in order to sign your code

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,930
I then went to there were three main

106
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,160
antivirus vendors out there that sell

107
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,140
you certificates that you can sign your

108
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,730
program once it's sign is verified

109
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,970
secure and now it can run on an

110
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,320
enterprise so I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fine I had to</font>

111
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,390
register a company I then had to

112
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,459
purchase a phone number and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I bought</font>

113
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the certificate but the companies have</font>

114
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">to verify or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people you buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

115
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,010
certificates from they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> verify</font>

116
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,409
that you are actually a real working

117
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,050
company so what do they do they give you

118
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,850
a phone call so I weights it I got the

119
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,400
phone call from the company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

120
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,000
purchased from saying hey we see that

121
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,169
you have a

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,670
certificate that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to purchase</font>

123
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,200
the Civic it was not cheap<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one is</font>

124
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">about six or seven hundred dollars that</font>

125
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,890
i paid for on my own we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

126
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,520
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a true working company</font>

127
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,260
I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have over</font>

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,729
500 employees this year and we're

129
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,070
expected to have record profits in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

130
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,760
next following quarter said oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay no</font>

131
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,450
problem sounds legit then I got an email

132
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,039
congratulations your company has been

133
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,200
verified here is your certificate

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,070
signing or your code signing certificate

135
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,560
I said very good i<font color="#E5E5E5"> took this now code</font>

136
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,050
signing certificate I sign my malware I

137
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,210
was then able to execute my malware on

138
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,790
the enterprise trusted and verified in

139
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,280
fact unfortunately due to this deadly

140
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,950
science software my malware now ran

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,500
better after I signed it with a

142
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,020
reputable company<font color="#CCCCCC"> then even before it</font>

143
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,020
was signed and the unfortunate part with

144
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,090
just blindly trusting signed software is

145
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,609
whenever you look at who actually signs

146
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:30,359
this it did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even say my registered</font>

147
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,850
company no it said the name of the

148
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,520
actual organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I purchased it</font>

149
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,650
from so top AV vendor one of your top

150
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,359
three it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one of them said verified</font>

151
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,070
secure and it ran perfectly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,360
enterprise I said okay well I think that

153
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,560
one is good let us move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the next</font>

154
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,630
way we can attack and exploit

155
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,130
computermachines so in essence<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

156
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,860
just saying is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're bolted on strategy</font>

157
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,330
has failed many many many times so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

158
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,430
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to still come up with better ways</font>

159
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,530
to secure our<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems using different</font>

160
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,050
technologies and now let's go here to

161
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,849
the fallacy with security our fallacy

162
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,850
with security as I see it right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

163
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we believe so long as we start with</font>

164
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,320
a secured state I just bought my

165
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,840
computer nothing has run it has not

166
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,909
touched the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet thus if I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

167
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,619
secure my systems from here forward let

168
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,150
me just install the antivirus let me

169
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,280
install the software right now and

170
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,669
everything else shall be secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no</font>

171
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem we only have less than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

172
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation so I cannot</font>

173
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,150
go over all of these but what I will

174
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on is this one because sometimes</font>

175
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,489
we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say well good might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

176
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,990
enough but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case so here we</font>

177
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,970
are the root of the problem that we see

178
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,550
lies in how security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is considered</font>

179
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,590
during its inception so most people will

180
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,970
create a product and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then say well patch</font>

181
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,380
it after it's been released<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

182
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,420
install<font color="#E5E5E5"> software on the</font>

183
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,659
system and will still remain secure but

184
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,090
here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an issue three years ago we</font>

185
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,530
started to notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that was when</font>

186
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the report started to come out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

187
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,419
news that new purchased software new

188
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,520
purchase laptops in particular this is

189
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,110
lenovo that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually mentioned in</font>

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,229
this article<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wonder who make some</font>

191
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">novels so let's see they said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that now</font>

192
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:09,030
it was found brands<font color="#E5E5E5"> new systems that you</font>

193
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,720
are purchasing from the manufacturers

194
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:15,299
already come with malware embedded on it

195
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,560
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday Jake spoke about the</font>

196
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,290
different rings that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have that</font>

197
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,480
programs can run on so here i am at ring

200
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,989
antivirus to protect my computer machine

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're at even before ring 0 at your</font>

203
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,710
were embedded on it so how are you going

204
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,290
to protect it there's no software i can

205
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,109
create that i know of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can secure</font>

206
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,840
hardware that already has embedded logic

207
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,330
to compromise that computer machine less

208
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,330
that's us we still have a long way to go

209
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,620
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to better secure our computers</font>

210
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,300
now here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to talk about the</font>

211
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,590
anatomy of us of our cyber attack

212
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,630
because if i were to say what are our

213
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,580
steps to attack a computermachine we all

214
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,680
know this we would say it by heart we

215
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,270
first start with reconnaissance we scan

216
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the computer and enumerators</font>

217
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,500
vulnerabilities port services whatever

218
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,020
is running<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we try and exploit this</font>

219
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,700
machine via some sort of penetration and

220
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,500
then whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

221
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,450
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then finally you'll have some</font>

222
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,580
derivative of achieving your stealth and

223
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,200
persistence and maintaining access<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

224
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,039
good this is what we're familiar with

225
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:23,550
right any any changes here you can say

226
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:27,360
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if i'm wrong no we're used</font>

227
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:30,330
to this right head nuts<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well i like</font>

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,849
to propose that this is actually how our

229
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,789
new cyber attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually looks like</font>

230
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,560
now in fact Matt weeks sitting right

231
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,819
there I once worked with him in this

232
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,489
actually the smartest guy that I've ever

233
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked with before we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worked on a large</font>

234
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,760
enterprise to protect it and to secure

235
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,360
it from malware he was the best reverse

236
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,370
engineer I i I've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen so one of</font>

237
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,990
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know and protecting</font>

238
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,700
our computer machines is that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go</font>

239
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here to the anatomy of a</font>

240
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyberattack this fails so if you has the</font>

241
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,529
a cure you want to attack or launch your

242
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,149
exploits against a real enterprise that

243
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,070
actually has software running you will

244
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:07,080
not get past scanning because you have

245
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">various enterprise-level firewalls that</font>

246
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,670
are already established us I cannot

247
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,270
enumerate the machines behind the

248
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,339
firewall so if this works you're

249
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,890
scanning fails I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can even ask</font>

250
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,839
Matt now with all of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

251
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,270
had on our computer machines we still

252
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,520
saw that malware is still making<font color="#E5E5E5"> its way</font>

253
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,520
onto the computer so how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that working</font>

254
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,829
this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will still see here</font>

255
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,319
your main five phases are along this

256
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,080
side but attacks have grown and

257
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,970
sophistication so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

258
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,520
brute force my way how about I start to

259
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,200
stage my exploits out there let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

260
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,880
let me be patient let me launch

261
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,190
different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attack the computer</font>

262
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,000
machine and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be successful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

263
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,320
exploiting large enterprise networks so

264
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,120
here's something I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to pick</font>

265
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,490
on because people's ways and their

266
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,260
ticket in their capabilities on how they

267
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,290
exploit people and exploit things always

268
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,120
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change yesteryear if we had</font>

269
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,219
a country that wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spy on a person</font>

270
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,200
you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not gonna pick on one but</font>

271
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,620
let's say the first letter starts with C

272
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,290
and it rhymes with<font color="#E5E5E5"> China so a particular</font>

273
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,760
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a country if it wants to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

274
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">after someone you know you might have a</font>

275
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,260
spy that might want to come close let me

276
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,790
listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're saying let me try</font>

277
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,439
and know you so maybe you can release

278
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,000
information tomb you know I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

279
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">understand what do you do in your</font>

280
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,370
organization but<font color="#E5E5E5"> times have changed now</font>

281
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,470
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of even having to assign a spy</font>

282
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,240
instead of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know you personally</font>

283
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,100
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to let me just release</font>

284
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,380
software software that by the way is

285
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,329
definitely free but we'll have some

286
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,380
embedded software or<font color="#E5E5E5"> embedded technology</font>

287
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:45,089
inside here's a case in<font color="#CCCCCC"> point whenever I</font>

288
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,709
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about cell phones here are two main</font>

289
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:49,079
applications that I pick on because this

290
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:50,520
was you know this hurt that I liked it

291
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">was really good but I was like seriously</font>

292
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,199
we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how we protect</font>

293
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,899
our systems here are two simple

294
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,120
flashlight applications the only purpose

295
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,149
of this software<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to turn on the</font>

296
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">lights of your phone before yet we get</font>

297
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,839
there how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a show of</font>

298
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands whenever I install an application</font>

299
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,990
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone how many of you actually</font>

300
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,160
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> permissions you're granting</font>

301
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,540
the application

302
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,250
okay that's good most people now I would

303
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,439
say most of you are probably lying

304
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,199
because we're in a hacker coffee like oh

305
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,610
yeah I'm sure sure I'm secure or since

306
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,079
most of you do look at the permissions

307
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you grant your applications how many</font>

308
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:29,128
actually say<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm I'm not going to use</font>

309
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,109
this application because it wants access

310
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,610
to maybe my voicemail or my phone calls

311
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,129
or my messages how many would actually

312
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,139
refuse to install an application okay

313
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:39,540
still majority majority of our people

314
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,759
but here's something that I mean I'm

315
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,740
still seeing in the wild is that you

316
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,199
have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications out there</font>

317
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,639
and now these applications like this

318
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,040
flashlight why does this want

319
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,180
information about your location some of

320
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,579
these applications want information

321
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,739
about your microphone your contacts your

322
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:58,709
call history why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that just</font>

323
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,240
to have a simple function<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell you</font>

324
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,128
as a malware writer if I were to do this

325
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,540
of course because if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

326
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:06,209
your meetings you will have your phone

327
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,250
next to you special proprietary or

328
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:10,709
secret facilities that you might work at

329
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,699
your phone might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there oh now I have</font>

330
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,560
an idea of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about</font>

331
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:15,300
other people might even write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down notes</font>

332
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,130
on the phone with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> microphone pointed</font>

333
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,099
to them perfect that's an even better

334
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,410
way that I would exploit my machines now

335
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,870
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did agree that ok fine most of</font>

336
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,579
us do look at the permissions we add and

337
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,459
allow in our application so that means

338
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:34,500
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us are highly embedded or or</font>

339
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:35,819
highly I guess confidence about the

340
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,439
security software<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you install all</font>

341
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:38,459
right no problem but here's our thought

342
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:41,219
question for the rest of this

343
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:43,109
presentation even if we secure all of

344
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,240
our devices that we use secure your

345
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,339
computer machines your<font color="#CCCCCC"> smartphones how</font>

346
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,930
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you care about securing the</font>

347
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,250
communication protocol that these

348
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,670
devices used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

349
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:56,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm let's talk more about the</font>

350
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,199
communication protocols next now how do

351
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">I we get to this particular research</font>

352
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,300
area I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting at an airport waukee</font>

353
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:04,800
watching people just<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk by as they get</font>

354
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,319
on and off<font color="#E5E5E5"> her</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> airplane so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm wondering</font>

355
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">a priority without any information about</font>

356
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,800
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are coming from can I</font>

357
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,660
determine where their points of interest

358
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,059
the places of habitation because I'm

359
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,559
just curious to know like where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

360
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:20,040
from how would I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that without</font>

361
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking you well I then thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if</font>

362
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,389
we can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this what is something</font>

363
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,990
that just about everybody has everybody

364
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,550
just about

365
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,870
has a cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone you will carry some</font>

366
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,449
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of electronic device with you a</font>

367
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,130
laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PDA or something you'll connect</font>

368
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,290
that to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet all right so now we</font>

369
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a connection now we have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

370
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,120
that we can actually start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze</font>

371
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,770
then from understanding these we go

372
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,050
right here to your hackers mantra I

373
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,660
wonder what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> if and the rest is</font>

374
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:47,069
history so in this case research I like

375
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do research I like to start with a</font>

376
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,970
few research questions that help guide

377
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,160
what exactly is it that I'm looking for

378
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,480
and what I wish to accomplish in my work

379
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,130
so we have the following research

380
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,690
questions I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to blow by these</font>

381
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,570
because I'm still checking time and I

382
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want to run out of time but in</font>

383
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,920
essence I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see your phones your</font>

384
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,079
smart devices they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

385
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,729
called a<font color="#CCCCCC"> P&L or we refer to it as a</font>

386
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,830
piano which is your preferred network

387
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,279
list what your preferred network list

388
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:16,470
does is your phone every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you have</font>

389
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,570
it on and your wife I simply enable is

390
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,980
constantly beaconing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probing out</font>

391
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,480
there hey access point are you within

392
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the area are you in the area are you in</font>

393
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,980
the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then if that access point</font>

394
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,329
does respond which is the true access

395
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,950
point that it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be then your phone</font>

396
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,620
automatically connects to that access

397
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,570
point and now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> service but I did</font>

398
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,029
not understand this further and to see

399
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:40,680
like how exactly does this look like in

400
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:42,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> frame level and also what happens as</font>

401
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,649
soon as that phone is established with

402
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network does to continue to begin</font>

403
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,399
there's a stop beginning what does it

404
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">look like I'm further on so that's what</font>

405
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,600
we do on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this research now here's some</font>

406
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,730
initial knowledge that is required

407
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,529
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

408
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,300
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you'll see these words</font>

409
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,290
reference in the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as soon as</font>

410
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,459
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release the code i'm</font>

411
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,990
planning on having it released on to

412
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,589
github next week that since I get back

413
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,720
home now the 802 11 protocol before I

414
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:08,520
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I was actually intimidated</font>

415
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,700
by the Wi-Fi protocol cuz i was thinkin

416
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,500
it's complex it's hard is difficult but

417
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,779
in actuality it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll say it's an</font>

418
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,250
intricate protocol but it's not hard as

419
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,899
not complex once you know exactly what

420
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,970
happens once you understand the frames

421
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,380
and the communications so i'll talk

422
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these three here and then we'll</font>

423
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,880
move on so with the 802 11 your Wi-Fi

424
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,529
protocol you have three main types of

425
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,990
frames you have a management frame

426
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:33,329
control frame and your data frame your

427
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,779
management frames are useful or they are

428
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:37,890
used for setting up that connection

429
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,850
synchronizing communications across that

430
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,259
socket

431
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,540
maintaining that socket and then

432
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,069
destroying it when to device there two

433
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,620
nodes are finished communicating with

434
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:48,930
each other we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have control frames that</font>

435
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,850
are not mandatory in this protocol this

436
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,769
is mandatory these are not your control

437
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,360
frames kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> help see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font>

438
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:55,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of congestion and the</font>

439
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,509

until the line is clear then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to communicate and finally your</font>

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,079

444
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:05,550
communicate across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

445
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come in the form of data frames</font>

446
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,449
and then your attitude on<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 client</font>

448
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:14,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that right now so two things I</font>

449
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,589
refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to whenever your phone wants to</font>

450
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:20,250
connect to the network I first call it a

451
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:22,139
Marco Polo type of instance in which you

452
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,120
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two people or many people want to</font>

453
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,069
sing Marco the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones responding hey</font>

454
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,269
I'm here I'm here I'm here that's

455
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:30,649
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your phone is constantly</font>

456
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:33,810
doing whenever your Wi-Fi is enabled but

457
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:36,899
what I also refer to this as is an

458
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">unstable marriage because what happens</font>

459
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,620
that I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know until I actually</font>

460
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,269
look at the protocol is even when your

461
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,459
device is connected to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> access point</font>

462
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:47,339
it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> access point like here we're at</font>

or hack glue dual stack or something

465
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:54,540
whenever your device says okay hat clue

466
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:56,670
are you within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area the access point</font>

467
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,339
responds yes I'm here let's go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

468
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,349
connect so at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point we then follow</font>

469
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,209
your connection your authentication and

470
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,679
then your association process and then

471
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:06,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">immediately when that is complete you</font>

472
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,760
start to see the data flow by your HTTP

473
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:10,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">request your file upload file downloads</font>

474
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,619
etc whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to do across</font>

475
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:16,859
that socket but what still goes on is

476
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,208
even when a marriage has occurred your

477
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,158
device is associate with the access

478
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,199
point that device is still saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

479
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:24,630
yeah I know we're married<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we're</font>

480
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,520
paired together but perhaps there's

481
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,319
another device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to so</font>

482
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,940
we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> constantly probing for other</font>

483
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,559
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> even when that connection is</font>

484
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,080
already established I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

485
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,520
pretty cool but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that occurs we</font>

486
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,049
are now<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do additional tracking</font>

487
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,789
exploitation because your phone is

488
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:40,650
constantly trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to other</font>

489
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:44,220
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> even after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a successful</font>

490
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,900
connection is established now here here

491
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,360
these are the pertinent frame subtypes

492
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,159
so it's just notes it's just reference

493
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,600
for you because they want whenever

494
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:52,650
you're reviewing the slides you actually

495
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,629
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see well how do you know</font>

496
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,850
all that truly that frame you're looking

497
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,950
at is a pro or it's a beacon request

498
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,810
because inside the frames whenever each

499
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,520
nodes<font color="#E5E5E5"> two nodes are talking your access</font>

500
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,810
point and your smart device they don't

501
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,460
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey I'm sending an</font>

502
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,899
association message or I'm sending a

503
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,430
beacon or an authentication message no

504
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,100
you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

505
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,570
particular bit that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> set to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

506
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is the type of message that's going</font>

507
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:18,540
across and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is vital because</font>

508
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,850
here are<font color="#E5E5E5"> four most well three most</font>

509
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,920
favorite frames here the probe request

510
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,840
in the probe response these are your

511
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,600
phones trying to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay device are you</font>

512
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">here can we connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry that's</font>

513
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,439
your those are you yeah that's that's

514
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,450
your probes and then your beacon is from

515
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">your access point your access point is</font>

516
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,810
always saying hey I'm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area i'm in</font>

517
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the area i'm in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> area so if you know</font>

518
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">what to look for then now you can tell</font>

519
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,429
as soon as a person has answered the

520
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,720
area what they're looking for and

521
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,780
different associations that have

522
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,610
occurred at any point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time okay so</font>

523
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,350
let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about building the sensor so</font>

524
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:53,340
building the sensor is actually very

525
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,500
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap in fact did you know that you</font>

526
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,790
actually have most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools required</font>

527
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,140
in order to build your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own distributed</font>

528
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,450
sensor to carry out a lot of

529
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,890
exploitation at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum you can do the</font>

530
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,710
scanning and tracking of people very

531
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:07,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">very easily so what things do we need</font>

532
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first we need is an alpha card so</font>

533
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,430
alpha<font color="#CCCCCC"> cars we are very familiar with</font>

534
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">these alpha cards are nice I love alpha</font>

535
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,420
cards other wireless cards will work as

536
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,330
long as you can put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into promiscuous</font>

537
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,340
mode so i can intercept or<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can receive</font>

538
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,169
and analyze all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the frames that are</font>

539
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,550
occurring on the network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just like</font>

540
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,650
alpha cars because they're cheap going

541
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,300
to amazon purchase it for thirty dollars

542
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,670
or so and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a new car that I</font>

543
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,440
can work with and write code to then

544
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:35,040
let's talk about t-shirt how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

545
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">have used T shark before good good about</font>

546
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,530
10-15 people okay what about Wireshark

547
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,990
how many have used Wireshark everybody

548
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:46,230
perfect well if you've used Wireshark

549
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,150
you've actually used<font color="#E5E5E5"> T shark because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font>

550
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,890
shark is the actual network packet

551
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,690
analyzer that's receiving the packets in

552
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,430
determining what's going on and the

553
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,800
Wireshark is your GUI on top of T shark

554
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,810
so thus you are already familiar with

555
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,180
some of the tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need T shark</font>

556
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,070
is free it's already included in your

557
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,180
kali linux instance this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the only</font>

558
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that we have to purchase for</font>

559
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,360
thirty dollars now as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

560
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,370
purchased the

561
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,370
alpha card i looked at the the actual

562
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:13,290
antenna that comes with this this is a 5

563
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,610
decibel antenna usually by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font>

564
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,950
decibel that that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good</font>

565
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,929
range that means wherever this access

566
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,340
point is in this building this alpha

567
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,350
card likely can intercept and

568
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,110
communicate with that access point so

569
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,790
when I this actual software on my system

570
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,919
that will get to and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few slides from</font>

571
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,870
now for the demo I saw that yeah I'm

572
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,180
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> good range in fact there was a</font>

573
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,379
particular time that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

574
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,840
different packets that come on i see a

575
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,850
slew of just random request that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had</font>

576
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,220
never noticed before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering oh</font>

577
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,840
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> just came into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the area so I start</font>

578
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,900
walking around the house I look outside

579
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">I co a mailman has just delivered quite</font>

580
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,860
a few boxes of new Alpha cars i have

581
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,750
purchased like ah this must be him this

582
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,659
is good good range that we have with the

583
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:57,710
Alpha cards but I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> satisfied with</font>

584
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">his actual antenna so I then went on</font>

585
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:02,220
online antenna this is an alpha card<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font>

586
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,810
decibel range<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ten I said what is the</font>

587
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,670
best range longest antenna that I can

588
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:11,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">purchase this is 5 decibel range and</font>

589
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:15,390
then I was very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> fortunate to find</font>

590
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:18,030
this guy five decibel this is the 12

591
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,380
decibel range antenna now this decibel

592
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,000
range<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't go like oh well this is</font>

593
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,220
only two and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half times or so better</font>

594
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,440
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no this is much much much</font>

595
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:29,100
better much better than this actual

596
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,340
range antenna in fact with this antenna

597
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,169
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell when my neighbors come</font>

598
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,629
into the neighborhood and they leave

599
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:39,360
multiple streets away because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this I</font>

600
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">can also send a signal much much further</font>

601
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,080
because I have a better antenna to

602
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,120
squawk that signal without even having

603
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,439
to worry about the power input that's

604
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,219
not my device because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still want to</font>

605
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,280
have boys soon so power is careful now

606
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,840
this guy I call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the baa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

607
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,120
whenever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see acronyms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is</font>

608
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,030
my baa and and for me it stands for the

609
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,669
big antenna because it's large and it

610
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,410
works very well so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> add this</font>

611
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,880
antenna to your alpha car to increase

612
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,830
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> range and also the area of</font>

613
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,380
reception if you can receive and working

614
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:13,770
with this entire system and then finally

615
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,540
we have a gps receiver so one of the

616
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,180
things or the limitation just about this

617
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,250
work itself is that whenever we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

618
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,510
says that we can intercept

619
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,940
we then in to check it against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

620
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,620
database a large database<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really good</font>

621
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,570
states that have been intercepted at one

622
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,729
point and then correlate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS</font>

623
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,710
locations from that point back into the

624
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,450
sensor so once I have that information

625
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,130
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can tell that a person must</font>

626
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,630
have been in that area once that

627
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,120
connection have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> established so you</font>

628
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,620
can start to track people that way but

629
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,889
the limitation is what happens when a

630
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,060
CID is not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular area or</font>

631
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:47,340
what if you want to be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific in</font>

632
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,649
a local area that you've moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to well</font>

633
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,169
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually add you just your own</font>

634
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:54,000
GPS receiver plug it into the system

635
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've already created the interface for</font>

636
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,390
you that will work off of your GPS

637
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,860
established so now you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font>

638
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,870
were driving and now you can have

639
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,860
precise pinpoints of new access points

640
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:06,419
and people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're seeing in the</font>

641
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,500
area<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now as I said before you</font>

642
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,240
already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools needed to</font>

643
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,200
establish this entire sensor this entire

644
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:15,390
network how much time do I have I'm okay

645
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,490
okay all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right good so in fact</font>

646
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:23,390
let's just do this so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

647
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:25,560
me let us go into Kali Linux here good

648
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,210
so I was running the system earlier so

649
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,360
at least you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see let me close this</font>

650
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:33,560
and stop at least yeah i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was looking at</font>

651
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,060
I'm sorry looking at you sits previously

652
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,480
gotta admit I'm addicted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it okay so</font>

653
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:43,919
here we are once this loads give me a

654
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,630
new terminal new window okay so if we

655
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,340
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at an initial instance of</font>

656
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,840
what what what things can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do Justin</font>

657
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,870
much just in your own site if you have

658
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,030
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple alpha card let's see so</font>

659
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:57,780
let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> T shark well the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first thing</font>

660
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,520
wants to do okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to make</font>

661
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,910
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have the our wireless card</font>

662
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,860
is actually I'm recognized by our

663
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:08,840
virtual machine so the first let's go

664
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ahead and put this into promiscuous mode</font>

665
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,649
so first I'll turn it off

666
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,710
then I'll enable monitoring mode for a

667
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:31,590
promiscuous mode then we'll bring it

668
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:33,210
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up come on haha good still looking</font>

669
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,439
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start just</font>

670
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:38,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">tea shark</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can do this on</font>

671
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own t-shirt now I will give it the</font>

672
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,600
parameters for the actual wireless card

673
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:47,720
that I have plug attached to the machine

674
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:54,980
then let's use filtering on particular

675
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:54,980
and five packets or frames that's this

676
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,640
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll say which field bless you</font>

677
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,460
which feels are we actually looking for

678
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,020
so one field we want will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

679
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,240
transmission address so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

680
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,190
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> address of the transmitter the</font>

681
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,750
mac address of this of the car that's

682
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,670
communicating this will be somebody

683
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">else's mac address or the actual</font>

684
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,790
computer the mac address of that

685
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,800
wireless interface card thus i'm saying

686
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:24,649
transmission address and also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

687
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:24,649
address your source MAC address as EE ok

688
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,380
now the destination address which mac

689
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,660
address are we actually looking for

690
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">census we're at layer 2 we're going from</font>

691
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,200
point to point node to node

692
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:41,550
communication then we'll say we want

693
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:47,190
information about each frame that we are

694
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:50,370
receiving finally this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> include</font>

695
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:54,690
management frames<font color="#E5E5E5"> I must have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spelled</font>

696
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:56,510
something wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok sorry I must have</font>

697
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:01,230
typed something incorrectly where is it

698
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:09,450
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see it t shark what is it at the</font>

699
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:15,930
end which<font color="#CCCCCC"> one for ok here wait one</font>

700
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:17,850
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that looks good this one no</font>

701
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:21,320
that one's good yeah that that one

702
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:24,750
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine why WLAN that looks good</font>

703
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,060
what oh I spelt feel

704
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:30,060
yes thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thank you sorry is that it</font>

705
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:32,429
aha gosh just a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> type on my</font>

706
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,889
mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is what we have at</font>

707
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,420
this point this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually the</font>

708
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,910
main base is about writing the entire

709
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,320
sensor so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have different packets</font>

710
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,990
that we are seeing across this network

711
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,220
and the most important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I care</font>

712
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,980
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be something that you all</font>

713
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:50,520
can recognize already which is this side

714
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:53,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah we are right here do you recognize</font>

715
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,290
these yes these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sips that we</font>

716
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,480
have going across many of us are

717
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,970
connected here<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us hack glue ipv6</font>

718
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,650
hack<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lou dual stack these are what</font>

719
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,780
various devices are actually trying to

720
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate with even though you're</font>

721
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,730
established is also saying this so how

722
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,390
do we now create the framework well it's

723
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">very simple write your own wrapper that</font>

724
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:16,230
interfaces with this information now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

725
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,060
can send it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own aggregator and</font>

726
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,520
make additional understandings about

727
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,560
what's happening for instance if we know

728
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,870
each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these will send out an n</font>

729
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,850
number of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> City let's go ahead</font>

730
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">and correlate these now if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

731
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,209
correlate these let's check it against

732
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database if we can check it against</font>

733
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the database now let us map what we've</font>

734
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,570
seen here to these persons to begin to

735
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,900
create a location history of where

736
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,700
they've likely been<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so let's create</font>

737
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">our sensor what things do we actually</font>

738
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,570
need but that's the basis of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

739
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,400
this right there that easily and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

740
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:53,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">already have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools all you need is</font>

741
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,570
an alpha card let me wouldn't stop this

742
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the previous slide next</font>

743
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:04,260
slide no all right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably a</font>

744
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,730
hidden slide but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually included oh</font>

745
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,650
you can see right there you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

746
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,880
fields that i typed in order to get that

747
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if you want to recreate it on your</font>

748
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,710
own it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so now let's</font>

749
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:16,410
let's put it all together<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's put this</font>

750
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,240
puzzle together so here i created this a

751
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,000
new system a new tool called the thais

752
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,740
sensor suite now at a minimum I like the

753
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,420
program things as distributed systems

754
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,610
distributed computing so that I can have

755
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">each module or each component to handle</font>

756
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,929
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but to do that one thing very</font>

757
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,850
very well this is what I can now make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

758
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:35,550
extremely efficient and extremely fast

759
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,678
to carry out each step create your

760
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,730
sensors look at the network create your

761
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,770
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS</font>

762
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">beavers understand where people are tie</font>

763
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,120
this information together all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

764
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,860
aggregated here with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> main sensor</font>

765
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,350
aggregator that I just called it the

766
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,689
collector now your sensors these are

767
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:54,330
optional here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gps collector if</font>

768
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:56,340
you have that attach it to your actual

769
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,049
sensor<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will show you the flags and how</font>

770
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,790
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this running so you can also</font>

771
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:02,129
include your own war driving or you can

772
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,379
add additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> fidelity to your current</font>

773
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,580
framework that you are running then we

774
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,919
have the collector here now geo

775
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,809
retrieval geo retrieval is an important

776
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,790
agent in the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this one</font>

777
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:14,730
holds all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIDS that we've</font>

778
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:17,280
received along with the GPS locations so

779
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,620
any cid that has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> detected ever in</font>

780
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,450
the past whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's received from the</font>

781
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,370
sensor the collector queries for this

782
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,480
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the Geo retrieval and</font>

783
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,340
then that information is brought back to

784
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the collector so we can now see it later</font>

785
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:32,309
on but then wiggle I really love the

786
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,169
wiggle database though it how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

787
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:36,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">have used wiggle before willow that net</font>

788
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">right a few if you have not wonderful in</font>

789
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:41,910
fact everyone just say with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me wiggle</font>

790
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">wiggle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so at least you heard</font>

791
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,140
it once or twice<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so with this</font>

792
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,450
database you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> register and now</font>

793
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,980
additional SIDS that you've not seen

794
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,590
before you can query if it's in this

795
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,870
extremely large database if so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

796
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,790
add it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personal instance to</font>

797
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,918
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional fidelity towards what</font>

798
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,659
people are using in your current area so

799
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely a big module</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tie-in</font>

800
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,760
into the entire project and now over

801
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:09,570
here we log I log everything such that

802
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,669
ok ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so we log everything such that</font>

803
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,320
if there are any problems or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

804
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,809
your collectors go down I can simply

805
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,490
replay it at another side or if you have

806
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:18,990
distributed collectors around you can

807
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,549
collect everything at once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd send it</font>

808
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:22,140
to another collector via the log and

809
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:25,260
then you can see the entire network

810
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,390
replay again and finally all of this

811
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:30,270
information hackers we love to live in

812
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,860
the black<font color="#CCCCCC"> and white text or green and</font>

813
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,629
black right that's right that's our

814
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,059
colors but some people would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

815
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply visualize what all am I truly</font>

816
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:39,990
seeing in the network because we showed

817
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,429
a lot of text scrolling and in fact two

818
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,500
things I love most about being a

819
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:46,220
developer I love blinking lights and

820
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,110
scrolling text because it means progress

821
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,880
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case what if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only want</font>

822
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,350
to determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's happening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside my</font>

823
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,330
network well I create

824
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,559
separate interfaces that you can connect

825
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,899
across the network so now you can see

826
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is truly happening what decisions</font>

827
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,200
are being made by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the collector and</font>

828
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,449
every other module inside the network

829
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,730
all right so enough talk and I'll talk

830
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:09,049
enough talk let's demo let's do some

831
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,049
more demos let's hope all of these work

832
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:24,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start everything up</font>

833
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,470
right now except the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Geo instance so the</font>

834
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">geo retrieval that's the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

835
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,670
already have up and that's because this

836
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy takes about depending on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

837
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,630
the hardware that you're using it takes

838
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,400
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get it started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

839
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have various tables that you can</font>

840
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,240
actually incorporate into the system so

841
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,850
every table that you bring in I then

842
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,920
created separate are you separate

843
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:46,530
interfaces inside this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to then also</font>

844
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,470
determine which cities are located to

845
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:52,170
each Sid that's been detected so now you

846
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,910
can put alerts into your system let's

847
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,590
say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to find or alert</font>

848
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,660
whenever somebody from a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> city</font>

849
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,790
comes into your area that your network

850
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,770
is able to sense well this can provide

851
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,440
alerts so I created<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it just takes a</font>

852
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,580
while to actually do all of those

853
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,850
toppling so that's why I have it started

854
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,740
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the first we do wants to</font>

855
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,050
start will actually be the sensor I

856
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">always start with the sensor the sensor</font>

857
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:20,820
doesn't work he'll nothing will<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

858
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,040
to start it I will release also

859
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,860
executables but I'm still developing so

860
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,139
it's started with Java that jar yes it's

861
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,179
programmed in java I like the language I

862
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:35,460
like it a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you choose to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

863
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:38,280
Thea you will get to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java so</font>

864
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,460
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are starting the sensor is just</font>

865
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:44,520
releasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java des gardius enter enter</font>

866
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,500
now what the sensor does<font color="#E5E5E5"> I created that</font>

867
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">as soon as it starts it searches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

868
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">first wireless card that it can put into</font>

869
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,810
promiscuous mode then it tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

870
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,810
into promiscuous woman that it says it

871
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:57,389
was successful right that should say

872
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:59,550
good no problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> so at this side you</font>

873
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,860
then have four questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer the</font>

874
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is since it is a distributed</font>

875
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network what if you have a sensor here</font>

876
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,870
in this building<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have another sensor</font>

877
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:09,150
across the street you have another

878
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:11,010
sensor perhaps downtown somewhere so we

879
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">just add a little identification</font>

880
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,760
information so you know which sensor is

881
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,560
providing information because all of

882
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,230
this goes back into your sensor your

883
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:23,820
central collectors so here I'll say

884
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:25,340
specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> your name let's say hat clue the</font>

885
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:31,689
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this guy physical</font>

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:38,630
this is Park Hotel park hotel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ladder</font>

888
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to launch so you can leave it off</font>

889
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,310
because I did not connect the gps

890
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,960
receiver but if the gps receiver is on

891
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,250
and working it actually provides that

892
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,630
information over into the sensor so now

893
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:53,720
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that we are actually</font>

894
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:56,330
quite familiar with except<font color="#E5E5E5"> i add in</font>

895
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,740
quite a few more flags but at least we

896
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,590
can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sensor is working fine</font>

897
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:03,230
and providing additional data for us in

898
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,689
fact can you determine their that's the

899
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:13,280
blonde that's the redhead and a brunette

900
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:14,990
you see it yeah I made a punny<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

901
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,910
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the sensor working the next</font>

902
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:19,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing you wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is establish the</font>

903
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,989
collector so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect is receiving</font>

904
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,179
all of the information from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the various</font>

905
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:24,080
agents that are working aggregates it

906
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:26,060
and then starts to make decisions

907
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,659
towards what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside the</font>

908
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,659
entire network

909
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:37,368
so to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just Java the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> star Thea</font>

910
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,010
collector now as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as the collector</font>

911
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:42,049
begins he has so many different threads

912
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,220
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> added in because eventually the</font>

913
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:44,929
system is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to grow you're going to</font>

914
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:46,489
have a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> providing a lot of</font>

915
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,480
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your collectors so I just</font>

916
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,520
have multiple threads that are

917
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,319
established<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one handles frames as</font>

918
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,899
fast as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to keep your system</font>

919
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:55,788
running as efficient efficiently as we

920
00:34:53,899 --> 00:35:01,430
can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ok so the collectors</font>

921
00:34:55,789 --> 00:35:04,130
established how am I on time<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok good</font>

922
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,950
good good this still time ok so what I

923
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:10,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do here is I'm just oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let me</font>

924
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:12,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">back up so even though we have do this</font>

925
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,170
ok so the collectors established if you

926
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:16,520
type h or help you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

927
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,799
additional commands that you can send

928
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,089
from from the command prompt so these

929
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:22,788
are additional options that you have

930
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:25,038
inside each particular interface it has

931
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:27,740
its own<font color="#CCCCCC"> toolset that you can use so what</font>

932
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,390
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is sensor connect we want</font>

933
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,879
to connect the collector over to the

934
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:33,710
sensor so that's this command center

935
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,869
connect and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parameters just an</font>

936
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:40,160
IP address on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the port so here we are</font>

937
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:43,309
sensor connect I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna say</font>

938
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">localhost and the port that this sensor</font>

939
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,490
is usually listening on you can change

940
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:48,680
that I give you the option just read the

941
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:52,009
help what is by default i have it on

942
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,348
port 8080 so good so at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this point the</font>

943
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:57,200
collector is receiving a lot of packets

944
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:58,880
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess a lot of logs a lot of lines</font>

945
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,140
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sensor and then starting to</font>

946
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,700
aggregate those together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

947
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:08,960
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok what has it learned</font>

948
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:10,520
at this point now oops at this point

949
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,520
we're actually ready to visualize what

950
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:19,038
are we seeing inside the network ok let

951
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:21,049
me come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Linux here and let's</font>

952
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,720
establish the interface so the interface

953
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:30,770
is the visualization prior of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual</font>

954
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:34,220
sensors<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so here we enter the IP</font>

955
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:36,529
address of the collector wherever the

956
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,750
collector is and I know the collectors I

957
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:40,819
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here listening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're on port</font>

958
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:45,020
80 and then let's talk about some of

959
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:46,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">these widgets that will start to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

960
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,259
so in a second the interface is not

961
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,460
receiving information from the collector

962
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,470
collected receiving interface from the

963
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,580
sensors making various decisions so

964
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,689
you're now able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see new things that</font>

965
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,180
the collector has learned he kind of

966
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:59,450
spits it out here and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> now at this</font>

967
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,009
side this is your RSS I which is your

968
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,049
receive signal strength indicator that

969
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,790
gives you an idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how close with all</font>

970
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,770
things remaining equal how close is each

971
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:10,610
actual communicating device to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

972
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:12,890
sensor on this side<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will actually</font>

973
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:14,390
soon provide information on the unique

974
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,430
devices which device is out there and

975
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,740
communicating is it an apple product is

976
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:23,480
it a Samsung product lenovo etc at seven

977
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:24,950
center and the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing up here so</font>

978
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,240
that's unique devices which devices are

979
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,430
we seeing how can we visualize those

980
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:33,879
things now let's go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the detected</font>

981
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:37,700
clients tab so what we're seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here d</font>

982
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so for the detective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clients</font>

983
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,540
tab we have so many options at the top

984
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:43,640
that we can see here are the various MAC

985
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:46,250
addresses that we have here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor</font>

986
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,620
wait a minute did I say we can do some

987
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:51,380
enumeration or some information on the

988
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:54,380
vendors no vendors are showing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

989
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,910
let's fix that let's fix that so if we

990
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:59,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have vendor information about</font>

991
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:01,609
the actual creator of each device that's

992
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:04,220
communicating or each<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick of the device</font>

993
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:07,270
I created a separate agent that<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy is</font>

994
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:10,549
called oh you I so owe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stands for</font>

995
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:13,040
organizationally unique identifier now

996
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:15,140
if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain what that means your mac</font>

997
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,880
address six bites your<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual first</font>

998
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,799
three bites of every mac address is

999
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,750
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes that relates to the</font>

1000
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,000
vendor the actual creator of that system

1001
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,040
so if you have a list of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

1002
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,110
mac addresses then you can correlate the

1003
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,600
creator of that Nick network interface

1004
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,530
card to who's communicating so I did

1005
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for you so you have to go to</font>

1006
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:36,710
establish<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new agent so here we are</font>

1007
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:39,830
java<font color="#E5E5E5"> the star we want to load ouy so the</font>

1008
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:42,320
simple name is oh you I and<font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1010
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,190
it finishes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it established itself on a</font>

1011
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:48,530
particular port and then says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm</font>

00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:55,100
connect to the organizationally unique

1014
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:58,550
identifier agent on port 80 81 so that's

1015
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the collector and to do that should be</font>

1016
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:04,940
the texican continue scrolling but let's

1017

1019
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,710
that's done so now what the collector

1020
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,210
sees is all i have a new module that I

1021
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:16,130
know how to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with now he</font>

1022
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,380
starts to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> every mac address that</font>

1023
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:20,570
he's seen before over to the oh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1024
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,830

1025
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,140
his table that says hey by the way

1026
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,340
here's who's communicating the collector

1027
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,650
receives that information and now

1028
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,930
topples the creator of that mac to the

1029
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:32,480
actual mac address or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:46,939
mac address specified here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

1036
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:49,520
what I do see in a normal network is

1038
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,240
guess people really love apples but it's

1039
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,500
not the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> here or you turn off your</font>

1146
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:28,590
take you on to google and then if we did

1147

know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your gps location texas let me</font>

1148

see what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is heck glue the hell well</font>

1149
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:48,290

1150
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:53,630
sorry but normally I don't even happened

1151
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:56,480
around was that it's a VPN is it a VPN

1152
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:59,270
seriously I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think so well I don't</font>

1153
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,620
know anyway it would be nice it would

1154
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,850
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make me sleep better if it were</font>

1155
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:07,240
VPN does anyone know is it a VPN because

1156
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:10,009
I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we got Texas all right</font>

1157
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:13,430
so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other things you can do let's</font>

1158
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:15,080
see if we can go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> real quick I think</font>

1159
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:17,180
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only good look oh look at</font>

1160
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:21,350
this person well no need for that what

1161

1163
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,130
geolocation here let me eliminate that

1164
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so if I did want one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font>

1165
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,540
can come back here<font color="#E5E5E5"> say map all devices</font>

1166
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,790
so all the seeds that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been detected</font>

1167
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this particular area we can then</font>

1168
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,940
click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on them and then see the different</font>

1169
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,799
device that has connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

1170
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:43,220
where we've seen it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1171
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:45,680
are do we have anything here on our post

1172
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:50,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">guest anyone here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connected the post</font>

1173
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:53,810
guess in the past sound familiar no okay

1174
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:57,470
what else do we have well<font color="#CCCCCC"> LNG okay oh no</font>

1175
00:45:53,810 --> 00:46:03,590
I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the flag</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I'm out of</font>

1176
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:05,589
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> now something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one one minute one</font>

1177
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:09,430
minute please please okay alright okay

1178
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:11,960
alright so let's do this let's do this

1179
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:13,609
one thing we want to talk about is still

1180
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,440
vulnerability exposure in the entire

1181
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:17,660
network so that's just tracking people

1182
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,850
but we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually extend the attack</font>

1183
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,009
much much further because<font color="#CCCCCC"> your phones</font>

1184
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:24,170
are set up on a blind system of trust

1185
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,490
meaning it's always beaconing out the

1186
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,470
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> point are you there are you there</font>

1187
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:29,299
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me go ahead and connect to you but</font>

1188
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:31,160
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens we're here in Luxembourg</font>

1189
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,570
your home could be in Sweden we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1190
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,520
few friends we're talking to from Sweden

1191
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,020
or so but what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when that actual</font>

1192
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,759
access point becomes right next to your

1193
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,960
phone shouldn't your phone determine

1194
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,390
that wait a minute I've strayed beyond

1195
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,400
the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not the true one no it</font>

1196
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:46,520
doesn't happen like that instead any

1197
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,840
access point that says I am actually the

1198
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,040
access point you're looking for your

1199
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,020
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> will actually try and connect to</font>

1200
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so everyone on your phone what I'm</font>

1201
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,950
going to do now I have a separate wife

1212
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so by default Wi-Fi pineapple is</font>

1213
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,569
set up on this address I mean there is

1214
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:32,299
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of tutorials on how to</font>

1215
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:34,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">use it so let me login</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now once you</font>

1216
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:36,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">login now this is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mark five</font>

1217
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:38,299
so as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get home i actually have</font>

1218
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,280
a nano and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tetra that are on the way</font>

1219
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:41,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they've updated the device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1220
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,910
the different capabilities that can be

1221
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,829
provided to it now here i am actually

1222

just going to turn on the pineapple

1223
00:47:48,819 --> 00:47:56,599
actually before I do that let me make

1224
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:58,430
sure it can reach the internet because

1225
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:00,260
that means it's now so what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did I</font>

1226
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,210
established like additional bridge so

1227
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,589
any packets that are received it will go

1228
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,760
through my laptop that is connected so

1229
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,680
you can still search the internet just

1230
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:11,780
fine okay that looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay alright let's</font>

1242
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,040
disconnect from hak5 and now you will

1243
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,780
start to see that your devices are

1244
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,640
starting to connect to previous things

1245
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,180
that you've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your on your home</font>

00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,119
that's starting let me start Wireshark

1249
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:02,190
is anyone else seeing that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your is</font>

1250
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,900
your does your phone say that now you're

1251
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:10,320
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a device that it's not even</font>

1252
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:12,900
hot glue anymore no one yay nay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1253
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,510
well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did try this you would have</font>

1254
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually seen that in fact if I turn</font>

1255
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">this on if I go into my phone Wi-Fi yeah</font>

1256
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,710
mine says it's connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font>

1257
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,410
access point that actually connected to

1258
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:30,510
back in California but this actual

1259
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,850
device is doing it and another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

1260
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,260
that happens is if he wants to search

1261
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,790
the incident or so you should still be

1262
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to search the internet just fine</font>

1263
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,810
because it's coming through my device

1264
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:42,740
but I can intercept and view all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1265
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:49,070
packets that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sending now nice</font>

1266
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:51,180
LAN start<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we'll let that run so</font>

1267
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,650
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> working for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few people here</font>

1268
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">and see I'm back on the internet so I'm</font>

1269
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to get messages again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

1270
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,629
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and then I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finish</font>

1271
00:49:55,590 --> 00:50:04,950
I'll round up around up mr. Chris almost

1272
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:06,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">there well you give a mouse a cookie and</font>

1273
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:09,180
I'll ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a glass of milk as well</font>

1274
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so here are some recommendations</font>

1275
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:13,980
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have acrobat this entire I'm</font>

1276
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:15,720
protocol so one of the things is we

1277
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,250
definitely need an enhancement to the

1278
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,200
protocol because yes we write software

1279
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,700
hacking tools but is also good to

1280
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,339
understand how can we make our entire

1281
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,919
paradigm better so the first thing we

1282
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:28,080
definitely need a way to better topple

1283
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,420
the actual SIDS that your phone knows

1284
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:33,090
and the GPS location it's simple all of

1285
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,430
your smart devices have GPS already so

1286
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:37,440
they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be too far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a gap to</font>

1287
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,330
add this onto your phones once it is

1288
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,160
there your phone should then say wait a

1289
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">minute you're not in the area that I've</font>

1290
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,100
known you before do you still want to

1291
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:47,070
connect that should not be too hard to

1292
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:51,118
have the next thing on your phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1293
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:52,890
so as I say when we were young okay yay

1294
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,440
hi there are two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> our parents</font>

1295
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:57,299
always told us first thing look left and

1296
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,580
right before you cross the street the

1297
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,220
second thing always have unique seeds

1298
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,290
and your access points right oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1299
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:07,109
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they did however in this</font>

1300
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:10,109
case activate<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows now in this case I</font>

1301
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:11,150
say that having unique SIDS for demo

1302
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,620
laptop

1303
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:14,660
hackers you will definitely crash this

1304
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,700
machine so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care what happens all</font>

1305
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:19,640
right so your access points actually

1306
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,470
having unique very unique SIDS is

1307
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,120
actually what makes it more capable for

1308
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,919
me to track you because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've only</font>

1309
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,270
seen that particular sit in one area now

1310
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,140
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you've been in that area so</font>

1311
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:30,050
that's just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about</font>

1312
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:32,000
another thing how often have we actually

1313
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:34,070
audited<font color="#E5E5E5"> the networks that you've</font>

1314
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,840
connected to if we were if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was to</font>

1315
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:38,630
leave this on I like yesterday I saw

1316
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,670
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have like 15 20 about</font>

1317
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:42,440
17 different sits at your phone is

1318
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,690
actively beaconing to you don't need

1319
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,040
those as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you leave a network</font>

1320
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,480
that you like if you're going to the

1321
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,759
airport it's a free Wi-Fi when you're

1322
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,260
done remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so it makes it harder for</font>

1323
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,280
a person like<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to come back and track</font>

1324
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:56,750
where you've been in the past and then

1325
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,100
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've built this framework next</font>

1326
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,990
year I'm also explaining to build a

1327
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,569
separate exfiltration that doesn't even

1328
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:04,700
need internet itself but we need a

1329
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,860
better capability now of people to

1330
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,960
actually audit the 80 2011 protocol

1331
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,730
because you're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see people to</font>

1332
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,860
accelerate data just using the 802 11

1333
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,390
different frames out there i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can now</font>

1334
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,340
have covert channels<font color="#E5E5E5"> command control</font>

1335
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:18,080
without using internet don't trust me no

1336
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:21,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem you will see that's what release</font>

1337
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:24,350
next year<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i let me look wait i don't</font>
