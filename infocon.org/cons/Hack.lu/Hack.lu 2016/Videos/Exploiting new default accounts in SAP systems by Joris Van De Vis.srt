00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:28,470
everybody joined the talk from Quinn

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:31,288
earlier today what I got out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,500
at least a message that securities well

8
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,330
pretty much broken in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases she</font>

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,860
focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the networking part the</font>

00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:44,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet i will be talking today about</font>

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:49,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">ASAP ICP security used in many large</font>

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,870
companies and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very wide topic so</font>

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i cannot cover all in just</font>

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,919
a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i will zoom in on</font>

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:04,099
floor vulnerabilities that we still see

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:08,520
a lot and which expose quite dangerous

17
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:13,949
information well at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> every fortune</font>

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:21,329
2000 a lot of SP SP also has a lot of

20
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:24,509
customers so this is many many

21

businesses run on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems can I</font>

see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands is is instant is</font>

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:34,049
everybody bit familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> SI p again</font>

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,560
can you share your hand if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,689
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a CP not too many hands okay i'll</font>

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,329
i'll come back to that later<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll give</font>

ASAP basis consultancy which technically

32
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,289
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of installations and</font>

33
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:04,109
security-related work next to that I

34
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:08,240
also do quite some recipe security

35
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:10,799
research in the past couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years i</font>

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,390
discovered like 60 or 70 Filner

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,319
abilities in sp systems next to that i'm

38
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,108
also the

birthday thanks Cooper for recording the

45
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:38,280
a small company with a couple of guys

46
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,769
specialized in<font color="#E5E5E5"> SP security like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said we</font>

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,469
do SP security research and next to that

48
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:49,189
we do a lot of SP security assessments

49
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:51,599
for customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and last year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we also</font>

50
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:58,189
brought our own as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you p security</font>

51
00:02:51,599 --> 00:03:00,899
solution to the market so back to ASAP

52
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:05,939
for people who are not familiar with as

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,790
it be ASAP<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said running most</font>

54
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,578
of the corporate world it's big it's

55
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,209
huge it's storing all the business

56
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,669
critical data they have a lot of

57
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,250
industry specific solutions for oil

58
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:22,739
learning companies for financial

59
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:28,109
businesses for logistic cooperations for

60
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:29,729
governments and as mentioned and that's

61
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:32,699
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom line it's an interesting</font>

62
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:35,909
target because companies organizations

63
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:38,310
large organizations they definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely</font>

64
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:42,929
on this software if those systems go

65
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:46,169
down then well shipments cannot be sent

66
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">to customers or transactions will not</font>

67
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:52,049
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> processed all factories</font>

68
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:57,478
might stop running this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely a</font>

69
00:03:52,049 --> 00:04:02,569
business critical and there's also one

70
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:06,569
of the reasons why SP security is still

71
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:08,518
well under developed if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say it</font>

72
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,768
like that the thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

73
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,299
these systems are so business-critical

74
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:15,750
many customers don't tend to touch it

75
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,358
they're afraid patching means downtime

76
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,449
downtime means business down down down

77
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:24,400
time most<font color="#E5E5E5"> often and companies don't like</font>

78
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:26,229
that the good thing is that

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,690
we see more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more awareness at</font>

80
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:31,050
customers because this was a topic which

81
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,310
was for a long time really<font color="#E5E5E5"> neglected</font>

82
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,289
company spent a lot of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> on their</font>

detection systems endpoint security

85
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:44,830
whatever but a zippy security was for a

86
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:47,500
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a something that was</font>

87
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,159
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really looked after we see changes</font>

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,690
we see more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my customers actively</font>

89
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,580
you know at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least they are aware that</font>

90
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,830
they have to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> the step from</font>

91
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:02,590
their awareness to really fixing stuff

92
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:04,870
is quite it is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is little the</font>

93
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,239
good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that as you p as a as a</font>

94
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,260
company itself over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past couple of</font>

95
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,600
years did a lot to improve security

96
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,969
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think ten years or even longer</font>

97
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,520
after microsoft released their first

98
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,280
baseline<font color="#E5E5E5"> document now as if he also has</font>

99
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,960
one there they used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be quite a bit</font>

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,270
behind other big large software vendors

101
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,489
but they caught up they did quite a good

102
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,198
action there and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

103
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,849
there patches are their security guys

104
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,310
are there there is a baseline document

105
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:41,530
now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really up to customers to step</font>

106
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:44,380
into and to fix things may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good to</font>

107
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:47,469
mention we do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SP security</font>

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:57,849
funny or stupid in every assessment that

will be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic of the day when doing</font>

these as you p security assessments

116
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,960
there are two quite big attack factors

117
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,750
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily give you access to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">business-critical ICP systems one of</font>

those is the RFC gateway which is a

access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to port 3 3 X X where X X is the</font>

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,430
number of this specific SP system still

129
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,750
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot within companies if</font>

130

one of those systems is not properly

protected in your entire landscape if

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,010
this RFC is and protected it can give

you access to the whole as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> P landscape</font>

134
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:09,130
so that's an easy way in another easy

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,990
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> in is obviously fire default</font>

136

accounts and it's sad<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have to say</font>

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:17,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">it but like I said we still find them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:20,260
a regular basis so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could be talking</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">here about buffer overflows or some</font>

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:26,310
really deep technical cool ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

exploit ICP systems they do exist

142
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,510
however it starts with the basics and

143
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:39,730
many SP customers still don't have the

144

basics fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this this is a this is</font>

this you can find it on the internet or

148
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,239
order easily these are known for quite

149
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:01,630
some time as you can see for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example the</font>

158
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:39,520
known as apt hold accounts what we have

159
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,309
discovered some time ago is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

160
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,520
is a whole range of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> SAPT volt</font>

161
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:47,680
accounts which can give you sometimes

162
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,480
very high privileged access to ASAP

163
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:56,359
systems

164
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:58,699
this is the list these are also public

165
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,889
now but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny thing is I will</font>

166
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:02,930
mention it later is it was already

167
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:06,880
public for quite some time because it's

168
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned by SUV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in their documentation</font>

169
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:13,370
some of these users are created<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

170
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:16,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">so-called ASAP solution manager which is</font>

171
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,850
a central system to do technical

172
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:22,160
monitoring and stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but some</font>

173
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,199
of these users are also created in all

174
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,600
connected satellite systems as we call

175
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:29,120
them the solution manager is like a

176
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,370
central spider in the web and it is

177
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected to all the other SP systems in</font>

178
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:37,550
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> landscape so if you can get access</font>

179
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,130
to the SP solution manager most<font color="#E5E5E5"> often it</font>

180
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:46,579
means that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the whole</font>

181
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:49,819
landscape so many customers have<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

182
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:53,689
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok are those users in my system</font>

183
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:57,079
because we want to know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

184
00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,139
there how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we figure that out and the</font>

185
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:03,979
thing is if you run this SP solution

186
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:06,019
manager system for over five years then

187
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,940
chances are quite big<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those systems</font>

188
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:13,670
or in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> out those users are in your</font>

189
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:16,300
system because most customers use the SP

190
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:20,180
solution manager because it is

191
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,399
obligatory from SP itself because the

192
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">only way to read three patches and to</font>

193
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,399
download software is to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> via this</font>

194
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:32,449
essay p solution manager so back at

195
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,100
least back in 2007 as if he urged

196
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:36,949
customers to really start using this

197
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,050
system and as from them from then on

198
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,599
customers really did but already quite

199
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,459
before that time many customers were

200
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,560
working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SP solution manager if</font>

201
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,899
you set this up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system more than</font>

202
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,819
five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago then the wizard that</font>

203
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:53,120
introduced these accounts with evil

204
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:55,790
passwords was already there so most

205
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers do have these accounts not all</font>

206
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,130
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

207
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,830
but many do and it's depending on the

208
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,990
scenarios that you use if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

209
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:10,210
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> or way more of these accounts</font>

210
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:12,280
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> essay p system yeah like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

211
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,860
mentioned these default accounts were

212
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,810
introduced by a wizard if you install

213
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SI p solution manager you had to run</font>

214
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:23,920
like a post installation wizard and that

215
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,370
post installation wizard was creating

216
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,189
these users with a default<font color="#CCCCCC"> pollard</font>

217
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:32,170
nobody knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at least customers did</font>

218
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,830
not because these users and passwords

219
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:38,079
were used in like all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of background</font>

220
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:41,520
processes and as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as these processes</font>

221
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,520
were running everything was fine right

222
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:48,070
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the of</font>

223
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,720
the of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> code in a specific clause in SB</font>

224

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,460
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from as you can see there it's in</font>

226
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,680
it one two three four this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

227
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,770
class is still<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the most current</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">version of SE p solution managers the</font>

229
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,800
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's not being used anymore so</font>

230
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,390
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be scrapped within the past these</font>

231
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:13,479
constants were used to create these

232
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:16,230
users<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more on why these</font>

233
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,640
users got created in the first place

234
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,850
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> EP solution manager</font>

235
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:25,180
is like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical system that is used</font>

236
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,640
for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example technical monitoring but</font>

237
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,459
you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for way more you can use</font>

238
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">it to do checks on custom code you can</font>

239
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,710
use the SP solution manager for example

240
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,710
to do change<font color="#E5E5E5"> management where you can</font>

241
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,480
have a ver a flow that is automating

242
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,600
changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your landscape and stuff like</font>

243
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:48,040
that depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on all those scenarios</font>

244
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,350
did you activate you will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

245
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:55,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these particular users in your</font>

246
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:57,190
SP system but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one basic</font>

247
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,470
scenario that every customer needs to

248
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,480
run and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that already introduced quite a</font>

249
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,190
couple of SP default accounts with this

250
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,460
default positive in it one two three

251
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,460
four

252
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,970
so like I mentioned most of these users

253
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:14,420
get created in sp solution manager but

254
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,330
there are others that are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that get</font>

255
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:20,750
created all throughout your landscape

256
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,970
which is bad because that means one of

257
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">these users is most often enough to</font>

258
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,010
compromise an S EP system if they are

259
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at your landscape then it's</font>

260
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:38,620
quite hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop the leaking as</font>

261
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned this essay p solution manager</font>

262
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:46,130
it's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart of your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SP landscape</font>

263
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:50,120

264
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:55,460
entire recipe landscape are connected to

265
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:57,890
this central ASAP solution manager that

266
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:02,030
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it an interesting target because</font>

267
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:04,310
of these connections if you can attack

268
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:07,160
and get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this SP solution</font>

269
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,619
manager you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have basically access to the</font>

270
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,230
whole landscape from this SP solution

271
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,839
energy you can jump to the other SP

272
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:18,800
systems so it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it should be</font>

273
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,140
quite hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and protect it I don't see</font>

274
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">that too often in real life because the</font>

275
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,780
SP solution manager is like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

276
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,520
business system<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's abyss it most often</font>

277
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,380
it's a system for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> techies they do</font>

278
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,380
their technical monitoring there and

279
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:38,990
it's it's most often not not

280
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:41,540
particularly hardened it's it's it's a

281
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:46,280
dangerous thing will<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will show you</font>

282
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:48,380
that later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on yeah how bad is this like</font>

283
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,290
I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IP solution manager is</font>

284
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:55,370
is is definitely the most interesting

285
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:57,199
target in your landscape and if the user

286
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,730
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before exist with</font>

289
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:10,240
the what<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes it more complicated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

290
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:14,209
that most SI p<font color="#E5E5E5"> business systems are</font>

291
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,190
managed by as it be authorization

292
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:18,219
consultants they create users they

293
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,620
create passwords they make sure they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

294
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,260
do you hold the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in those systems</font>

295
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:26,080
but they do that most often for the

296
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,640
business systems as<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SP</font>

297
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:31,170
solution manager is often seen as a

298
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,790
technical system so the normal

299
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,890
authorization administration people are

300
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:42,969
not looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that system so it's quite</font>

301
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:45,090
quite ignored in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next couple of</font>

302
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:50,050
minutes i<font color="#CCCCCC"> will show you some live demos</font>

303
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:54,730
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you how you can exploit these</font>

304
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:56,589
users they don't all have big large

305
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,780
authorization some of them have a

306
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:02,710
limited set of authorizations but

307
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:05,620
nevertheless it's important some of the

308
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:09,220
demos will use other vulnerabilities we

309
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:13,420
discovered in<font color="#CCCCCC"> sp systems to to make an</font>

310
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:15,790
exploitation as successful what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

311
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,199
to stress here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it's always good</font>

312
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:22,360
to pop shells on ICP systems and from a

313
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,600
technical perspective or a pen test

314
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,450
perspective that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cool however</font>

315
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,650
keep in mind these are business critical

316
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:35,830
systems so having a shell having root

317
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:39,100
access or you know she'll do an essay p

318
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:42,520
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> always means a complete business</font>

319
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromise from there you can if you</font>

320
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:49,449
know how you can manipulate business

321
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:52,210
transactions you can get really

322
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensitive data encrypted credit card</font>

323
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:58,720
data you can steal intellectual property

324
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:01,570
you can still recipes for example from

325
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,660
you know companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Heineken or</font>

326
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,940
Pepsi or coca-cola they store light the

327
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,510
recipes of their secret magic formula

328
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:13,530
and ICP systems so popping shells on

329
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:17,190
such systems is definitely definitely

330
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,190
something not good

331
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:42,880
so what i will show you first and maybe

332
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">i should go back one more time to the</font>

333
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,130
slide because what you see here if you

334
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,350
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of those systems you</font>

335
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">will see that many of them are of the</font>

336
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:59,889
type system but some of their our

337
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:03,928
dialogue type users so what does that

338
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:07,179
mean dialogue users can be used to

339
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:11,190
interactively<font color="#E5E5E5"> lo home to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SP system</font>

340
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:15,789
via as a big gooey which is a fat client

341
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:17,740
system users cannot be used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not</font>

342
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:20,320
interactively but you can find other

343
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,510
ways to get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to SP systems I will</font>

344
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,139
show that later on first of all let's

345
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:28,840
have a look at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> essay p support user</font>

346
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,570
which is of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> type dialogue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have an</font>

347
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,820
ASAP system running here locally on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

348
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:39,210
laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope it won't crash because</font>

349
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:43,870
it's consuming quite some resources so

350
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:46,690
let's first show you what might happen

351
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,760
if this<font color="#CCCCCC"> SP support user is in your SP</font>

352
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:53,950
solution manager I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on within</font>

353
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:56,440
eight one two three four password if its

354
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:01,289
initial it's forcing you to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

355
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,289
immediately that's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

356
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:13,689
so this already<font color="#E5E5E5"> means we are in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> S EP</font>

357
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,899
system which is not good<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not</font>

358
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:20,350
good however this system or this user

359
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,400
has a quite limited role so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

360
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,929
go for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example to transaction as a 49</font>

361
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,270
which is a transaction where you can

362
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,360
execute operating system commands and do

363
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,160
privilege escalation and stuff like that

364
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,280
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

365
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:39,220
shows at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom of the screen you</font>

366
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:44,580
are not authorized to use transaction as

367
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:46,930
49 and quite a couple of other

368
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,929
transactions are also not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for</font>

369
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:52,420
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> transaction su 01 which you can</font>

370
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:55,690
use to give yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> more authorizations</font>

371
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not working as well however we</font>

372
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:01,330
discovered a vulnerability in the past

373
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,659
and I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you how that works</font>

374
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:07,210
because transaction as a 38 works for

375
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,250
the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are quite into S EP</font>

376
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:13,300
systems they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

377
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:17,290
execute a web programs and for example

378
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:20,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is a program called like this that</font>

379
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:23,980
you can execute and what it does it

380
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:26,399
allows you to execute operating system

381
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:30,010
commands with only a subset of

382
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,820
predefined whitelisted operating system

383
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:38,740
commands for example the end command if

384
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:41,950
I execute this it will give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

385
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:45,640
of the environment variables which is

386
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,440
well nice from a Decker perspective you

387
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,740
could say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I can use this for maybe</font>

388
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,830
gathering some more information for

389
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:56,440
further attacks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not all you</font>

390
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:59,260
can do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we discovered is that it</font>

391
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,860
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only allow you to execute these</font>

392
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,020
predefined commands but you can also

393
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:12,149
inject here and the parameters your own

394
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:13,500
ones so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say for example here Who am</font>

395
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,090
I

396
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,790
then what will<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen is that it execute</font>

397
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:21,639
that command instead of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> predefined</font>

398
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:25,840
one this is patched already quite some

399
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:28,600
time ago but this gets more interesting

400
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,040
because it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have like an shell</font>

401
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,809
within the SP GUI and you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

402
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:43,809
execute whatever you want if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

403
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:48,370
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to IP configuration you will have</font>

404
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:52,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is good from an</font>

405
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:54,219
attackers perspective because what this

406
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,740
means it means if you can execute

407
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,710
operating system commands on an ICP

408
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:03,520
system you have an implicit trust

409
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:05,799
relations with the database so from here

410
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,160
you can do anything you want in the

411
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:12,160
database get all data insert new records

412
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:16,809
update existing ones i will show you

413
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in another demo but this is to show</font>

414
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:26,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do with this as AP</font>

415
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:29,760
support user the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dialog one so in a</font>

416
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:37,389
second demo we will have a look at

417
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:41,429
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> user which is the as in the</font>

418
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:45,280
agent then the score sit user and that

419
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:47,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">one gets created as a system user that</font>

420
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,928
means that you cannot use the SP GUI to

421
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,629
log on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a system but there are other</font>

422
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:55,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways around what you can do you can use</font>

423
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,690
the RFC SDK which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a software</font>

424
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:02,110
development kit to execute RFC calls to

425
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,870
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> SP system it's like a system call</font>

426
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:07,059
it's not interactive via the GUI but

427
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:14,040
it's connecting to the ASAP system

428
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:15,800
anyway and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did i wrote a python</font>

429
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:23,149
script

430
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:26,750
that is using this RFC SDK what it will

431
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:30,140
do and for the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are quite</font>

432
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,840
familiar with SP systems this might

433
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,420
sound familiar for others I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

434
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,120
explain what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to do is I'm</font>

435
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,940
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call a particular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> function</font>

436
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,550
module a function module and<font color="#E5E5E5"> SP is like</font>

437
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,900
an API that you can call you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put</font>

438
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in it and it will give you</font>

439
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:51,050
something back and those function

440
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:54,440
modules can be either local or remote

441
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:59,330
enabled the local ones you<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot call</font>

442
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,610
directly via an<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC call and the one</font>

443
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:06,740
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to execute this SDF</font>

444
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:09,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">rbe native sequel select is a local one</font>

445
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:12,620
which sucks because we cannot call it

446
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:16,370
remotely however we figure out there is

447
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:18,919
a way because SI p was offering another

448
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:22,429
function module which is remote enabled

449
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,700
and which can act as a proxy to call

450
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:29,210
this local one so what despite the

451
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:32,120
script does it's connecting in this case

452
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:34,150
with the SMD agent user with the default

453
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">password in it one two three four it</font>

454
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:41,720
will use this remote enabled function

455
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:43,939
module to call a local one and this

456
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,540
local one allows me to do a select

457
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,580
statement on the US ro<font color="#E5E5E5"> to table and this</font>

458
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,560
gets interesting because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US ro</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

459
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:56,600
table contains all password hashes of

460
00:24:51,560 --> 00:25:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">SCP systems and then well in a hedged</font>

461
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:06,199
way but we'll get back to that later so

462
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:07,700
if I execute this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Biden script all you</font>

463
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,520
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know is the host the system</font>

464
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,460
number the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user and a</font>

465
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,980
password well this is nothing fancy just

466
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:20,480
by nmap kind of scanning you can get all

467
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:22,040
this information if I execute that what

468
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,390
it gives me back in a router and

469
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:34,940
structured way is username password

470
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:39,290
hashes user<font color="#CCCCCC"> buzzer dash these are rather</font>

471
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:45,230
old password hashes they are hashed in a

472
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:47,540
format which is md5 kind of hashing and

473
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:50,690
it can be proved forced really

474
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:53,810
relatively easy with tools like hash get

475
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:57,410
you might know hash get open source

476
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:59,990
freely available so just to give you

477
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:02,150
short demo of what it looks like all

478
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:11,830
these password hashes that you see here

479
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:14,000
I put them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a text file like this</font>

480
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:19,270
username dollar and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the password</font>

481
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:24,620
hash so if you feed that to hash get and

482
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:27,020
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just on a quite simple GPU</font>

483
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:31,669
that's in my laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> already after quite</font>

484
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:33,680
some time here you will see that it's

485
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,870
already proved first one of those users

486
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:39,590
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just would let this run for</font>

487
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:46,639
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of 20 24 hours it will</font>

488
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:49,459
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove first ammo so again fire</font>

489
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,560
another user combined with a couple of

490
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,810
other vulnerabilities which are patched

491
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,850
already by as a bee but still we find

492
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:58,250
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sp systems you can retrieve</font>

493
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:03,709
password hashes brute force them and lo

494
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:10,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">Han with any user you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want all right</font>

495
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:13,040
next to another example again a user

496
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,310
with this default password in at one two

497
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,840
three four and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a user which gets</font>

498
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:20,360
created with quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

499
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,409
authorizations it's called the soma

500
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:27,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">betch user which is used in the</font>

501
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,870
background to run batch jobs and as it

502
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,270
be

503
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:34,300
and since this user has quite a lot of

504
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:37,900
authorizations you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to call a</font>

505
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:41,980
specific function module which is there

506
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:44,290
to actually execute operating system

507
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,260
commands so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a function</font>

508
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:49,600
module that has a vulnerability this

509
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,280
just works as designed and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

510
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,770
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that this so much vets</font>

511
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:59,830
user has enough rights to execute that

512
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:02,860
so what we will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will abuse this</font>

513
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:07,030
specific user to directly in the

514
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,919
database create an SP user which is

515
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:11,379
rather nice because normally if you

516
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:14,860
create SP users in the application it

517
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:18,280
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot and probably if you create your</font>

518
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,260
own user it will trigger some

519
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,149
notification and somebody might start

520
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:25,120
asking questions hey why did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

521
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:27,280
a user but we are not going to do it in

522
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,469
the application itself since we do it

523
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,030
directly in a database the application

524
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:36,730
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you create this</font>

525
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:39,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">S EP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user so for that purpose I wrote an</font>

526
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:42,130
other python script as you see here we

527
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:46,450
will use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> embed user with init</font>

528
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:50,440
1234 password the default one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

529
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:54,210
we'll do here will execute this function

530
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:58,890
module three times will call an

531
00:28:54,210 --> 00:29:03,730
operating system tool command to execute

532
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:07,740
sequel native sequel and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

533
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:10,300
mentioned this before because as it be

534
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,950
operating system<font color="#E5E5E5"> users have an implicit</font>

535
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,770
trust relation you can directly access

536
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,660
the database which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally because</font>

537
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,360
the application also needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write and</font>

538
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,920
retrieve stuff from the database so you

539
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,379
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to specify a database</font>

540
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,660
password you can just say minus you

541
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:28,840
default and then we're going to update

542
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,760
into this us<font color="#E5E5E5"> ro</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to table that we saw</font>

543
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,570
before that contains the password hashes

544
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,660
i will make a user there go in with this

545
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:40,300
hash now the funny thing of these hashes

546
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,400
is there's no salt in it in this old

547
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,610
backwards compatible password hash

548
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,610
so this one will work in any ASAP system

549
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:52,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just created an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SP user in my own</font>

550
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:57,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">system I know the password obviously so</font>

551
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:59,379
i can import this hash did I know the

552
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:04,300
positive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can alone in a system</font>

553
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:06,100
later on we'll do another nice trick for

554
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:10,330
the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with SP</font>

555
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:12,820
user administration you can create

556
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:16,449
reference users<font color="#CCCCCC"> so called reference</font>

557
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:19,210
users are a user that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is taking over the</font>

558
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:22,030
authorizations of another user so what i

559
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:25,930
will do i'll just say our newly created

560
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:28,870
user go in make it a reference user for

561
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">d deck indeed it is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard-coded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel</font>

562
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,800
user and as a key systems that has the

563
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,930
role as it be all which basically means

564
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:39,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">route god mode whatever you want to call</font>

565
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:46,960
it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll just take it over and attach</font>

566
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:51,629
it to my own created user if I execute

567
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern script again I have to</font>

568
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,290
provide the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host name system number</font>

569
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:01,139
client and in this case we'll use this

570
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:04,030
so long bet user with the unit 1 2 3 4

571
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,580
default password now what you'll see

572
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:10,870
here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of rows are</font>

573
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:15,870
updated in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database so if everything</font>

574
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:21,429
worked we can go home with our go in and

575
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:26,229
in you go is the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the</font>

576
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:31,390
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> hedge that I insert it so we're</font>

577
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:33,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">in and what I will show you if we go to</font>

578
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:36,070
this go in user that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just created and</font>

579
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:40,060
have a look at it then you'll see two

580
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:42,370
things it has reference user<font color="#CCCCCC"> Didache no</font>

581
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,200
other also signed but it doesn't matter

582
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,870
it takes over as it be all from this

583
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,470
account and what you also notice is that

584
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:52,959
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last changed field is completely</font>

585
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,610
blank because it's not created filed

586
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,860
application the directly in the database

587
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:06,620
so not many people will figure out what

588
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:13,729
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this user another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> launch</font>

589
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:16,699
demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to show you is using</font>

590
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit maybe some of you are doing</font>

591
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Baptists if you ever come across an SP</font>

592
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,929
system and you figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out some SE p</font>

593
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,120
users you might wonder what to do with

594
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:29,450
it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might not be familiar with the</font>

595
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,209
GUI and SB specific stuff so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

596
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:35,980
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit modules you can use</font>

597
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:39,320
to just get your shell and<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit</font>

598
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:44,270
just a quick demo in this case we'll use

599
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:46,220
the soap RFC command execute module<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

600
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,940
already prefilled at this type II

601
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:54,410
address of the target this is my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

602
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:57,040
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come on show and again we'll</font>

603
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:01,940
use these default credentials so embed

604
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:15,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">buzzards in at one two three four let's</font>

605
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:23,809
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> run a module no session let's do</font>

606
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:25,760
bad let's give it another try<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

607
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:31,210
for the demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> gods we're fine with me but</font>

608
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,210
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a backup for this kind of thing</font>

609
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:40,580
as its allows them I'll go back to my

610
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:46,309
powerpoint anyway so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just quickly</font>

611
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:54,649
show it via a video the same screen that

612
00:33:46,309 --> 00:34:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just saw is here again using a soul</font>

613
00:33:54,650 --> 00:34:00,460
messenger it might be hard to read but

614
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:06,630
it's the same screen as we saw before

615
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">and basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it does is like a</font>

616
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:13,440
river is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cheryl and giving you back the</font>

617
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:21,600
show that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can further use in your</font>

618
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:25,020
dentist or whatever well for the ones

619
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,389
familiar with metasploit you know what

620
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:31,620
this means<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case I'm just doing I</font>

621
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:33,450
have config commands but who am i but

622
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,040
also from this command line you can

623
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:39,029
abuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> this trust relation with the</font>

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,489
database<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm showing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that here it might</font>

625
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:46,470
be hard to read but those were the

626
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:54,149
Buzzard heshes you saw there throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

627
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:58,290
in hash get and you win so quick some

628
00:34:54,149 --> 00:35:01,400
notes how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> discover this we use for</font>

629
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:06,390
quite some time open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool solar</font>

630
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,760
to index a web code most SP systems are

631
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:11,879
a mixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> tape stacks so called a web</font>

632
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,720
systems the programming language of<font color="#CCCCCC"> SCP</font>

633
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,550
itself and especially really large ECC

634
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,069
systems enterprise core systems they

635
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:22,250
might contain up to 300 million lines of

636
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:26,100
code you don't want to go through that

637
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:28,580
so we used some tooling from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martin Soho</font>

638
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:32,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a guy from South Africa I think</font>

639
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:34,080
hooray who wrote like an interface for

640
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:37,170
solar so you could index all<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bab goat</font>

641
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:40,080
and we're just searching through the

642
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:41,550
source code google style you just search

643
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,529
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific strengths i was searching</font>

644
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">for in at one two three and a half</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

645
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:49,680
in at one two three four and we thought

646
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,040
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> well where does that come from and</font>

647
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,779
then when we googled actually that

648
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,490
particular buzzards string that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

649
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,890
we figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ap</font>

650
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:05,040
documentation already from 2010

651
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:08,250
mentioning these users and buzzards also

652
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,710
there isn't a zippy note<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure</font>

653
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,530
you can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

654
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:15,200
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> SP documentation way more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

655
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:19,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">this that makes mention of this default</font>

656
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,129
password so we took the rather long way

657
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:23,720
to index all source code<font color="#CCCCCC"> and figure out</font>

658
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,359
this password while<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could you step</font>

659
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:30,348
read the fucking manual but nevertheless

660
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:32,810
we got it so how to protect yourself

661
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:35,240
there's quite some measures first of all

662
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,859
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out if those users</font>

663
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,830
are in your system with the default

664
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:42,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">password we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> created some tooling you can</font>

665
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:46,369
download it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our website erp said</font>

666
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:50,089
calm it will show you if it's there

667
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:52,609
apart from that there's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ASAP</font>

668
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:55,910
which is a tool from martin<font color="#E5E5E5"> casio he's a</font>

669
00:36:52,609 --> 00:37:01,160
guy from core security and he made a

670
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:03,920
bicep which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> python a framework to</font>

671
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,839
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of SP assessments it's open</font>

672
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,910
source so if you ever come across an ICP

673
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:12,740
systems your pen test make sure to<font color="#CCCCCC"> check</font>

674
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:14,359
it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not go through this slide</font>

675
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,790
because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

676
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:19,490
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically how to protect yourself</font>

677
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:22,550
is change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default buzzards it's as</font>

678
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:25,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple as that there's a lot of</font>

679
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:27,170
so-called<font color="#CCCCCC"> SOP security notes you can</font>

680
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,880
look them up and download<font color="#E5E5E5"> them later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

681
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,950
check there's a lot of information there

682
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,839
how to help you changing this puzzle it

683
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,669
might be a bit complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

684
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:37,820
because it might break business stuff

685
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:40,400
there's also why customers don't tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

686
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:42,349
do a lot of security<font color="#CCCCCC"> as be</font>

687
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,760
security-related<font color="#CCCCCC"> betch because it might</font>

688
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:50,330
break business and business is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

689
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,710
and you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if those if you don't</font>

690
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:53,569
need those users from a business

691
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,420
perspective you might create them as

692
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,830
honey tokens for example so you can set

693
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:02,170
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody's</font>

presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be available later you</font>

697
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,690
can look it up also the links to the

will be there this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically the</font>

705
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:48,170
for the first demonstration<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font>

706
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:50,480
call some other program and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

707
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:54,079
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know which kind of program you can</font>

708
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,510
abuse with because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very quickly and</font>

709
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:01,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean a Python script no no no the</font>

710
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">first demo when you exploit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a 38 and</font>

711
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:08,059
then you get you call a program sorry

712
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,640
with the end of random variables yes

713
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:14,599
this is what you mean probably yeah but

714
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:18,680
the name of this other<font color="#E5E5E5"> program this is</font>

715
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:20,390
the HP KU v ah sorry the first is the

716
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:29,509
particular name of the other program yes

717
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:33,828
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you here we go it's this one</font>
