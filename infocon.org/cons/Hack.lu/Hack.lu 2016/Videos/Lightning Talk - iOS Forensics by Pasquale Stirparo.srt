1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:08,450
so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon everybody I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pus-y</font>

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> power and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today we'll just be</font>

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,370
quickly go through a comparison between

4
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:16,730
the forensics analysis of mobile

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,230
messaging applications I unfortunately

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,869
don't get to do any<font color="#CCCCCC"> more on my daily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,730
iOS mobile forensics in general but I'm

8
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:25,340
an apple freak so whenever<font color="#CCCCCC"> half time I</font>

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:30,349
try to research still iOS and Mac

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:32,469
forensics devices so a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick</font>

11
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:35,720
background information that is needed

12
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:37,640
now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you manage to have access for</font>

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,519
access to the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want to</font>

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,700
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are since I guess 8 now</font>

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple kind of decouple the location of</font>

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bundles of the application with the</font>

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">data so now we get a bundle folder which</font>

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,820
contains the bundle clearly then that of

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,910
older were usually most of the

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,520
application stores their data and shared

21
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,309
up group folder which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the name</font>

22
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,050
suggests the location where application

23
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,309
stores data that they want to share what

24
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,920
they want to use to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

25
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:10,280
applications so it's very important not

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow to forget about this last</font>

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,199
the in the poll environment which is

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,940
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> pee list for like usual</font>

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
configuration files and the data are

31
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:26,539
actually almost all the time stored in

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,680
cigarette format civilized databases an

33
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,140
important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember when</font>

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,490
analyzing the mobile applications when

we talk about cigarette at the basis

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,960
that the when you delete<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font>

this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing another important and</font>

54
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:25,190
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relevant I'd say features of</font>

55
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,790
iOS that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful for the example we'll</font>

56
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:32,870
see later is this the fade out effect

57
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:34,700
for those that are they use iOS devices

58
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,230
you know that when you're using an

59
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,209
application and suddenly you receive a

60
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,829
call or you push the home button what

61
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,290
happens is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition between</font>

62
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">these two screens is done in a way that</font>

63
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,940
basically iOS makes a screenshot of your

64
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,970
current what you are going to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

65
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:53,329
current screen and then uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> des des</font>

66
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:56,270
fade out from the PNG that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

67
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,920
generated but this pinche is actually

68
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">stored somewhere because once it's done</font>

69
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,489
it needs to be saved somewhere and of

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,250
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> each application has its own</font>

71
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:07,610
location where the last screenshot is

72
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:11,480
stored so let's take this scenario you

73
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:13,400
are writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your dear trusted friend</font>

74
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,350
your favorite exfiltrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> are super</font>

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">secure message you are using the top</font>

76
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,630
notch encryption you are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> careful</font>

77
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,660
pgp or you use a messenger application

78
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:26,450
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course secure so encryption</font>

79
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,090
you're safe and you want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

80
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that nothing gets like linked back to</font>

81
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,130
you and while you're finishing your

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,040
typing something like this happens so

83
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,750
two things here<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly first your boss</font>

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">has a great sense of timing definitely</font>

85
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:45,260
and guess what happens then this your

86
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">super secret message gets is lying clear</font>

87
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,810
text well clear image in your device so

88
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,660
although you send it encrypted well your

89
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,870
messages is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> aligned clear text your</font>

90
00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:00,049
device lets them quickly compare the

91
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,880
three applications I what's up telegram

92
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,340
a signal which are like most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular</font>

93
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,310
anyway they<font color="#CCCCCC"> should claim some security a</font>

94
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,530
certain extent and we're interesting the

95
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,390
data tres not the encryption and that on

96
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,100
transit so quickly these are the

97
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,380
location<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you can get the what's up</font>

98
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,540
this is the sequel<font color="#E5E5E5"> a database you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

99
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're interested mostly into you get of</font>

100
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:24,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">course all that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information and clearly</font>

101
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,270
all the the charts are in clear text and

102
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,380
these are also exported in the backup in

103
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,180
case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got backup which</font>

104
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,820
not encrypted and yes what's up does

105
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,330
store they match the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshot if it's</font>

106
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,340
if it happens while you're typing

107
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,530
another application which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to</font>

108
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,150
be even more secure is a telegram<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

109
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,919
this is the database you are interested

110
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,799
in two and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the main table</font>

111
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,760
where you have messages encrypted

112
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,530
information but in cryptic conversation

113
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,599
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a telegram supports the</font>

114
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,320
feature of like you know the charts

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,880
secret chat so let's see if you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

116
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,940
search in encrypted see do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get this</font>

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,740
ID but guess what if you search in the

118
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,440
messages basically this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a flag</font>

119
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,080
so your secret that the chart is just

120
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,020
flagged as secret but is in clear text

121
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,390
in your device quickly last but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

122
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,859
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay of telegram instead doesn't</font>

123
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,740
store the screenshot they managed

124
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,540
properly and then seconds left last but

125
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">not least signal that's what he promised</font>

126
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,120
everything is encrypted and but there is

127
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">this descri is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear it by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> default</font>

128
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,370
actually you need to have you need to

129
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,820
enable there is the option enable screen

130
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:37,670
security and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

131
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,159
surprising for<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal so seeing what</font>

132
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,660
they actually they do but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,000
can actually enabling your settings on

134
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,430
the web this the screen protected and

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,710
this means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that before releasing the the</font>

136
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,420
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the application when the</font>

137
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,940
screen the screen transition has to

138
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,680
happen they blew the clear the screen so

139
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,340
what happened basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the signal</font>

140
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,400
logo when you go to to retrieve the

141
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:03,469
screenshot and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a quick</font>

142
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,299
summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course the color coding is</font>

143
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,990
from the analyst point of view from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

144
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,110
user perspective is other way around and

145
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,640
so you can get plenty of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

146
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,800
that's it i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> running to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> catch my plane</font>
