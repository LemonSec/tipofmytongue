little bit about you know predictive

risk and security analytics and what

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,680
really I'll do particularly around the

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,239
insider threat and the people within a

18

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,850
what's the problem well sixty percent of

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,990
all the attacks come from the insider

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,699
and the vast majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you be very</font>

problem it is outside that that that

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,009

a real way and that will become clear I

38
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,659
think you're all very aware of this you

we look at taking a unique risk where

you look at the behaviors of the

150
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,620
that's when they take the IP

151
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:40,250
and you can focus a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

taking what people are doing with data

devices applications and illuminated by

157
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,980
putting that contextual data around it

158
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,890
as well and here's an example with one

159
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,900
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers where effectively we</font>

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,419
within the organization with the context

162
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,850
around why we floated them and they are

163
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,550
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to then deep dive into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay as is</font>

busted he's stealing on information and

166
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,500
and one of the key things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to build a</font>

167
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,060
proper program around this you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you identify people of concern</font>

171
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,960
and and then validate that before you

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,940
make any<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision so you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build a</font>

proper insider threat program around

174
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,500
that and this is really dashboard wise

175
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,980

pulling an email chat and HR data and we

195
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,810
managed to surface things like you know

stealing our goes it was illuminating to

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:56,070
say the least so the key differentiators

204
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,590
you know we cover the broadest data set

that's it you know the people at the
