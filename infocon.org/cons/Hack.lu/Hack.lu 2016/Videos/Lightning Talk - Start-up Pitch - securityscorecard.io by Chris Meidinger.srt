one company is versus another and that

129
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,439
boils into the platform so I've got the

<font color="#E5E5E5">names obscured to protect the guilty hi</font>

of which companies these are but

132
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,209
essentially there's a portfolio of

133
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:20,309
companies each with a different security

134

rating each of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is broken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down if</font>

135
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:25,079
you click into the company into those<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

136
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:27,300

00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,479
the bottom right here of the overall

138

all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my vendors which companies have</font>

141
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,539
the most common issue which companies

142
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,119
have been decreasing so which companies

143
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,558
have gone from a high to a low grade in

144
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:45,569
the last seven days that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might indicate</font>

that it breaches imminent or it might

00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:49,379
indicate they just quit funding their

a large enterprise you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

150
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,789
rethink your relationship to that

152

second because this is a technical

153

conference and this takes a minute for

154

this to flip<font color="#E5E5E5"> high into some of the</font>

00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we've got because the one use case</font>

157
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:13,919
is pure vendor risk and that's the sort

165
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:31,919
the first early steps of a pen test or

166
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:34,649
you know the scoping discovery

167

169
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,480
data store would just have all this data

170
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,170
I'm don't lock on these accounts

171
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm if you would I I don't know who

172
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,870
cares I am minutes perfect just couple

173
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,840
in a couple examples I just coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

just three minutes ago I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hit a post</font>

180
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,640
search all this by whatever port and

181
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:16,650
look if there's any else to port 23 at

182
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,090
Oracle and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is leveraging</font>

183
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,919
the fact that we've attributed a

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,169
different parts of the internets two

185
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,990
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies and so we can go</font>

186
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,390
very quickly and figure out where does

187
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,250
Oracle have tell Matt<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a semantic</font>

Raptor firewall wow what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that thing</font>

189
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,050
even get updates anymore I'm all right

190
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,200
into this is the type of data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can</font>

191
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,390
be used it feeds the actual product but

192
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,610
it can equally well be used for auditing

193
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:45,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">pen testing lots of different ethical</font>

194
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:48,210
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am another example just looking</font>

195
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,369
at leaked passwords we scrape I paste

196
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:54,390
bin number different sleek sites in

197
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,420
order to find I password dumps and we

198
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:00,360
save those then again we attribute them

199
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:03,180
versus the high versus the company in

200
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,430
order to arrive at<font color="#E5E5E5"> score cards like this</font>

201
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,990
one so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to learn a</font>

lot of depth this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the current Cisco</font>

203
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,990
scorecard i have got a 76 percent and

204
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,370
we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last 90 days discovered</font>

205
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,500
two different passwords or at risk

206
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,660
bubble this up again we're not saying

207
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco is good or bad for having two</font>

208
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,770
passwords leaked we're making imperative

209
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,160
assessment how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco passwords are</font>

210

out there versus juniper versus Palo
