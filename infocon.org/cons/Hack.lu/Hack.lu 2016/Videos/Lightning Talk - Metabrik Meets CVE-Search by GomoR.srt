1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:13,280
yeah finally so tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning hi ever</font>

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eight-forty-five it's got re in</font>

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the morning so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make some</font>

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:27,830
teasing to help you wake up and at'em my

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:30,020
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so for today so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will not go</font>

6
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the details of bed meta brick but i</font>

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:36,019
will show you what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do with it for</font>

8
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:40,399
instance here in the circle some people

9
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:42,498
are developing a tool to krys v cv data

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,260
basil locally stored on your computer

11
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:51,170
and so I did write some weeks to to play

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,818
with the severe search so in meta brick

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,789
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to play</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

14
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:58,280
search by tag I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> play with</font>

15
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,859
several search and you see you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:05,120
two bricks which are speaking about

17
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:08,210
severe search so one of the first step

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,280
to do is to install dependencies for the

19
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,589
brick you want to use here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">install dependencies for apiic view</font>

21
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:21,259
search so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has followed password and</font>

22
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:24,229
those who did in it is installing some

23
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:28,509
open two packages and some perl modules

24
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:33,369
I said it I said the word<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's burn and</font>

25
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:36,439
so the rig is now ready to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and</font>

26
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:39,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can I do with this brick</font>

27
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,648
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> call her help of the brick and as</font>

28
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:45,890
you can see you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a few bunch of</font>

29
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:50,619
commands you can use we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with such</font>

30
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:54,679
TBF oh so here in fact it's creating the

31
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:58,189
API available on the Civil stats website

32
00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:02,659
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a REST API oh</font>

33
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:04,969
no no magic here you can create a

34
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:09,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">vailable API for instance if you bros</font>

35
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:11,769
you can get the list of vandor you can

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,410
suffer it because it's ultimately

37
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:19,460
automatically piped in the less stuff so

38
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:22,700
okay you're such a stuff what do you

39
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">have you see you of completion so if i</font>

40
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,859
do tab here it shows me what which

41
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,290
comments are available<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to fetch</font>

42
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,770
late latest addition to the base so it's

43
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:37,040
less last<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment so you have all the</font>

44
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,500
link all of that in fact is saved in a

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,390
variable which as the name of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font>

46
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,830
command so you can play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it again</font>

47
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:56,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">and couldn't the number of entry you</font>

48
00:02:45,830 --> 00:03:01,400
have because it's a hash not this one is

49
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:08,050
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to couldn't it's a</font>

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">result one all right</font>

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:18,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so I have to look again at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

52
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:24,829
restructure its results with<font color="#CCCCCC"> es</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I</font>

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:27,710
gather results<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok now I kind couldn't</font>

54
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,810
remember ok so the research results<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

55
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,240
just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day moment as you can see</font>

56
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,070
once you have a result from the canal

57
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,770
you can play with the result of the

58
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:40,310
canal like<font color="#CCCCCC"> two lights</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a Python</font>

59
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:43,610
shell but it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Porsche so you have</font>

60
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,520
another database another brick for

61
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:51,050
severe such its database if you search

62
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:54,980
what can you do with it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

63
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">some commands you can run whenever then</font>

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">is easy install there is a command to</font>

65
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,200
use the source code of a break sometimes

66
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,019
maybe you may be interested in in seeing

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,510
what you have inside so in a brick you

68
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:12,320
have some properties which basically

69
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:16,579
defines some commands some attributes

70
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:20,000
and the required modules to run and you

71
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,000
have the needed packages to run it so

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,530
for civil search you have to install

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">python 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by telling people to install</font>

74
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:30,200
dependence and thanks to the insulin and

75
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,270
it's done for you there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a brick that</font>

76
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:41,479
will just fetch as the git repository

77
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:43,760
three minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok perfect and once the git</font>

78
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,980
repository fetch it will automatically

79
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,760
call a peep tree install through to

80
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,290
fetch an installer requirements after

81
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,979
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have command to in its database</font>

82
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">I just followed the guide online on how</font>

83
00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:00,680
to install<font color="#E5E5E5"> civil search on you will</font>

84
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,570
local desktop and I will follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,350
it's calling a Python script once terms

86
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:08,030
of stuff you can update that obeys

87
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:12,229
repopulated at a base and of course

88
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:15,260
they're from some search so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

89
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:17,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to call the damp last to see which were</font>

90
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,500
the last addition to my local database

91
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:23,310
ok so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a variable with stuff I</font>

92
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,550
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more information on the sea</font>

93
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,190
ezel I just consider search and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

94
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:32,040
number so okay I do have all the

95
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:35,270
information well that's how civil such

96
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:39,120
works you can create your local database

97
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:42,240
so there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing new here but</font>

98
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,420
maybe you are well that severe search

99
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,080
stores data in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduced</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or MongoDB</font>

100
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,150
database so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just want to play</font>

101
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,810
with directly with what is written in

102
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:58,409
the ridges database<font color="#CCCCCC"> or just go program</font>

103
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:00,210
you want to list databases ah it helps

104
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,390
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> d tells me that I have to connect</font>

105
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:08,250
first so okay I'm connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the local</font>

106
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:11,490
database I do have two databases and I

107
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:14,460
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> list all the keys of you have</font>

108
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,070
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that DB 12 if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

109
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:21,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create it you have to call it 12 but</font>

110
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:23,400
that's ready and now it dumped the

111
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:27,270
complete content of the Ready Set abase

112
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,159
you have whatever we want the same is

113
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,770
true for mongodb for instance because

114
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,970
some data storing a MongoDB database so

115
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,969
you use an ungodly stuff what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

116
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,650
help you have all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps you want</font>

117
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:45,590
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to list available</font>

118
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:49,200
databases so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to connect first and</font>

119
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,020
you have three local databases in

120
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,630
MongoDB database as collections one

121
00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:00,000
minute some<font color="#CCCCCC"> collections so now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

122
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:02,550
list collection names from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE gb so</font>

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,430
I have all the collections but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

124
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:10,860
dump the content of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection so now</font>

125
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:15,810
I call another criminal call get-get

126
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:22,050
database collection find all cvd be and

127
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:25,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I will dump for instance NS so it takes</font>

128
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:28,260
some time so now I turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complete</font>

129
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:31,260
content of what story in the MongoDB

130
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:34,140
database and it's safe listen to do our

131
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,490
random variable so you can play with it

132
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">again and do whatever</font>

133
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:45,900
want with it let's meet a break tomorrow

134
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,900
morning 845 thank you
