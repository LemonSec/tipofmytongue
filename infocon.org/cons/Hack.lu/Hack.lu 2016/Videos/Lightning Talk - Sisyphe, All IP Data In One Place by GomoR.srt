1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:12,650
okay so welcome batteries you know it's

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:15,230
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the meat a big guy now I want</font>

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a project I've been working</font>

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,619
on thanks to meta brick so in fact it's

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,669
what you can really do as an industry

6
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:30,320
lies the stuff i have written thanks to

7
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:35,899
two bricks so it's called sees if that I

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:38,270
oh I wanted to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like ipv4</font>

9
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:44,239
address space scanning like many people

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing since since a few years so and</font>

11
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,288
I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have some information</font>

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:55,010
available in only one place like so to

13
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:58,660
LA I developed as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can post cans full</font>

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:02,149
internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've also fingerprinting on</font>

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:05,089
tcp port basis I mean you just send one

16
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:07,040
packet one open port and you have the

17
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,490
state of the pot if it is open<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,410
and you also directly have the operating

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:15,679
system like easy to linux windows or

20
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:17,509
whatever so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible thanks to two</font>

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,760
bricks the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass can one and the</font>

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks HP 31</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did also perform math</font>

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,700
reverse dns scanning of all ipv4

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,970
addresses thanks to the network genus

25
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:36,170
brick so it takes something like two

26
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,570
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to complete well to complete a</font>

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:43,760
full reverse dns scanning of all IP four

28
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:47,899
races without being blacklisted<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,430
provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> writes better and i also do</font>

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,980
some net block and<font color="#E5E5E5"> joe IP location</font>

31
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:56,360
information things to database ripe and

32
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,210
look up 80 location<font color="#E5E5E5"> bricks and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want a</font>

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">true cap</font>

34
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,679
to be able to have the state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP</font>

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,289
address if it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed as a threat or</font>

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,910
not by publicly accessible<font color="#CCCCCC"> so at least</font>

37
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">like SNS I blocklist logic threats in</font>

38
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:17,140
the end I have to to develop distributed

39
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,600
architecture to collect information so i

40
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,940
have to manage multiple machines on the

41
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet thanks to the client openssh</font>

42
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:29,319
break the log are collected he has a

43
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:32,230
syslog ng protocol so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i used a brick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

44
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:36,070
generate configuration file and another

45
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:39,130
brick to send message is formatted the

46
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">right way for letter inclusive inclusion</font>

47
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,320
in an elastic search cluster which can

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,920
be managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client elastics Africa</font>

49
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,329
and in the end all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is rendered</font>

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,208
on a website called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seas if dot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IO</font>

51
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:59,080
which is here so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> input</font>

52
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:02,440
field and you enter the IP address you

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:07,180
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> and click search so for instance</font>

54
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,160
here the website regarding the result is

55
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,040
not really fancy but you have the

56
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">information at least so if you put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

57
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,760
IP address you have ripe information

58
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:23,860
regarding the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address subnet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is n the</font>

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:28,690
organization owning stuff and well this

<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real IP location and this is the</font>

61
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,359
on the right side the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have</font>

62
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:39,130
when you download the right databases

63
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,290
and regarding open tcp port on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

64
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">from nursing but you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reverse</font>

65
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,150
DNS data so all of that story in a

66
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,850
database there is no active lookup

67
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:53,380
performed on the specified official

68
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:57,280
wrestle it's a screenshot so that's why

69
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,380
there is a date here that the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font>

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,840
reverse DNS lookup so you know if the

71
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:09,470
data is fresh or not and this one is

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,450
listed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by block list as malicious IP</font>

73
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,150
in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network which was</font>

74
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:19,760
attributed to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aking team the famous</font>

75
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:23,360
italian company and today because these

76
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:26,030
lists are<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated daily even though this</font>

77
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,920
network is no more attributed to the

78
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,940
aching team it's still wrapped as

79
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">malicious so you have to take care us to</font>

80
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:41,840
take care of cyclist and not trust

81
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:44,090
completely at least another example so

82
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,099
this one is located in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States</font>

83
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,789
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have ripe data of course</font>

84
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,420
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. don't share network data with</font>

85
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:56,330
with the world for free at least and

86
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:59,350
this one at the port port 80 open and

87
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:03,039
you know it was a linux operating system

88
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:06,740
it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been seen the last time in april</font>

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,830
this year and you have the reverse DNS

90
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,600
data again with gimp will give some

91
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,969
information on the company behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

94
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:25,969

informations at that helps you

97
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:34,820
understand which<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of IP address you</font>
