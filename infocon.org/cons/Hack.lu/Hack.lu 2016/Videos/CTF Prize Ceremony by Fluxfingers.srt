00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:12,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hello everyone my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Luca and</font>

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:15,559
i'm a member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> flex finger CTF team as</font>

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:18,710
well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nicholas and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Benjamin and now we</font>

4
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:22,400
just want to give you some information

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:29,150
about the CTF that took place from

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:32,028
yesterday 12am to today 12am and yeah so

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,420
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> some fun facts about the CF um we</font>

8
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:40,270
had 739 teams that registered an account

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:44,570
and only 574 were able to activate<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:47,300
yes this the set two reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> first they</font>

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,309
forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and second I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the most</font>

12
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,180
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an HTTP</font>

13
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:57,260
500 on the server we needed to activate

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,160
most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams by hand him and so</font>

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,678
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is one of the reasons by</font>

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,340
about 150 teams but we're not activated

17
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,900
because they missed our announcement to

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,220
tell us that their account was not

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">activated so that we can do it by hand</font>

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:18,080
and of these 574 teams only 220 actually

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,410
participated in the CTF and soft at

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,810
least one challenge so yeah it's like

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:30,800
about a third of all teams that

24
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:36,230
registered in total we had 644 source of

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,210
challenges and we captured the network

26
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,390
traffic and at the end we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had 13</font>

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,850
gigabytes of traffic dumps and I think

28
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,490
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot because we did not have</font>

29
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:52,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">many services that needed interaction of</font>

30
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:55,009
the server so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about us a lot yes</font>

31
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,350
before we get to the actual result of

32
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,560
the CTF we need to tell you something

33
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:03,410
about our bonus point system we invented

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">a new one compared to last year we also</font>

35
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:09,848
allowed bonus points below<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

36
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:13,280
had a range from minus 100 2<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus 100</font>

37
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:15,200
this has nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with how fast or</font>

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,190
how efficient team solved the challenges

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,369
this is

40
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,859
just in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ranked or change is</font>

41
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,760
wrong so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can dynamically adjust</font>

42
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:29,000
the points ahead I have two examples

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,179
like Call of Cthulhu we write at least

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,210
in this challenge with 350 points so

45
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,520
that's about sixty percent of the teams

46
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,380
should solve it or fifty to sixty

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,580
percent and actually only one team was

48
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,769
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so we need to get we need to</font>

49
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,500
set the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ranking higher and we added</font>

50
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:51,620
another 100 points and on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,200
we had this simple PDF challenge and we

52
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,330
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that about eighty to ninety</font>

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,640
percent of the teams<font color="#CCCCCC"> were able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solve</font>

54
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,500
it and actually about ninety-five

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,359
percent wherever so we needed to lower

56
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,770
the points and this is why we get a

57
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">negative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bonus points local not the</font>

58
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:12,470
inter de actually interesting part the

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">prices now we will start with the local</font>

60
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,790
teams because there is some differences

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,400
compared to the international teams and

62
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,280
the third place this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to Keo</font>

69
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,089
prices because the local team member had

70
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,860
to get his airplane and he left about

71
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:23,030
two hours ago so we had to hand him the

72
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:25,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">prizes a bit earlier and yeah so we just</font>

73
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,390
