thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> love and yeah I'm actually very</font>

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,369
uncomfortable with that ear Mike because

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,779
it keeps falling off my my ears are not

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:27,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">very well aligned so I'll just hold hold</font>

6
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,419
this thing in hand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a shot</font>

7
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:32,700
yeah morning good morning and thanks for

8
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:37,379
thanks for showing up early in the

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,410
morning I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love hot glue very much it's</font>

10
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:41,699
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my absolute favorite events but</font>

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,178
they always put me up in the morning

12
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:49,530
talk which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a challenge anyway so</font>

13
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:52,829
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for being here this soft after</font>

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,739
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years coming to hack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lou</font>

15
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,839
i decided i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change up the theme</font>

16
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,828
a little bit I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing offensive</font>

17
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:04,408
stuff all all my career thinking of new

18
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,300
ways of attacking and you know figuring

19
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">out where we get blocked when the</font>

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,548
defense catches up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we kind of</font>

21
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:14,399
innovate our way our way out and come up

22
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a new attack so I i started</font>

23
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:19,590
thinking especially from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my customers</font>

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,369
viewpoint what a pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> i must be to all</font>

25
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:27,270
of them to to block me or to defend

26
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,590
against attacks that are coming and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,479
started taking a higher level look at

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec thinking okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we've</font>

29
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">been doing this for almost 20 years</font>

30
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:42,509
something needs to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and security</font>

31
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually pretty strange but while I</font>

32
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:49,500
was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought we do have</font>

33
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:52,020
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact today we we do have an</font>

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,850
opportunity to change the way we do

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:59,340
defense to come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more proactive</font>

36
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,829
methodology for defense and actually

37
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,869
succeed while doing defense not to just

38
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:09,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know get blocked by the next attack</font>

39
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">so my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alicia and the theme of</font>

40
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,460
the talk that the thought process was

41
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:19,470
today's<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks succeed because</font>

42
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:23,430
the defense is reactive we've we've

43
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:27,330
spent all our years chasing the

44
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:30,090
attackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> tails we've seen a new type of</font>

45
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,270
attack we've then scrambled to defend

46
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,730
against it it works for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while it keeps</font>

47
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,240
the new attacks at bay but then the

48
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:43,769
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve and the attacks have</font>

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:46,520
started evolving very fast way faster

50
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,710
than traditional defense can now keep up

51
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,440
so you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a company that can</font>

52
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,420
produce a box with blinking lights

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,480
starts pushing it out in the market it

54
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,280
gets installed everywhere to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for</font>

55
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,840
about six months and then it sort of

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,790
stays there<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lights keep on blinking</font>

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,850
and there's a process built around it

58
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:13,320
and then you go and look for a new box

59
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:15,000
this is no fun so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,940
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to divide this talk into two parts</font>

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,250
the first part is kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how we</font>

62
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,130
got here and the second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font>

63
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,310
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it so if you</font>

64
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,780
start tracing back from say 10-15 years

65
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:33,450
ago and look at where targets have been

66
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:36,150
targets<font color="#E5E5E5"> have shifted when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I started pen</font>

67
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:40,140
testing it was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about servers they</font>

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,600
moved the targets follow the path of

69
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,760
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> resistance so as as one area</font>

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,650
starts getting hard you<font color="#CCCCCC"> open up a new</font>

71
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,899
area you go to applications desktop

72
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,940
browsers and now the attacks follow the

73
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,840
the pockets you're carrying kind of an

74
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,220
attack with you wherever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go and now</font>

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,580
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course there's a whole Internet of</font>

76
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Things thing he out there which which</font>

77
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,550
also is vast attack carrier the

78
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:11,370
motivation of attacks a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

79
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,460
have talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the motivation is</font>

80
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,660
very clear it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the money</font>

81
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,510
whenever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can figure out a way of</font>

82
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">making money you have an attack</font>

83
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:24,090
technique coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

84
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,330
when we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a handle on d dos</font>

85
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,698
well here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go d</font>

86
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,698
to the max again can probably take out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

87
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:37,219
whole nation with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of flood that</font>

88
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:38,719
we saw from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the botnet of things so</font>

89
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:40,939
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to update this slide</font>

90
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:44,509
today's fashion is no longer breeches it

91
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:46,250
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible d dos but yeah this there's</font>

92
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,199
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> train every year there's a there's a</font>

93
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,969
trend of attacks coming in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

94
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,300
year there's a new trend breaches have

95
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">now become so commonplace that yeah used</font>

96
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,870
to get really excited oh wow<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony got</font>

97
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,150
hacked and they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> owned and they got</font>

98
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,729
like slaughtered through the press but

99
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,400
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough press not not the</font>

100
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">same magnitude of press about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo it's</font>

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,359
like okay we've become numb to it yeah

102
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:11,930
breaches will happen oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> shit there goes</font>

103
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,659
our passwords again and we kind of just

104
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,490
we don't bother about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we've closed</font>

105
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:19,159
down or yahoo account and open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

106
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:22,879
other junk email account to collect spam

107
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:26,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">i wonder if google gets breached or what</font>

108
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:29,300
are we going to do but how have you been

109
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:33,699
behaving as far as defense goes over the

110
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:36,229
past 16 years we've kind of stride to

111
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,139
restrict everything somewhat<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

112
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:41,990
city of Gondor we've you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know had walls</font>

113
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:45,560
we've built walls in circles all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

114
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,740
to the inner core so we first start with

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perimeter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we started with</font>

116
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,180
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know securing applications endpoints</font>

117
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,020
desktop<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sonja there are there are</font>

118
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,930
creative Souls out there so yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

119
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,900
got all your firewalls at ids and dep

120
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,839
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sank boxes only to be circumvented</font>

121
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:10,789
by techniques created by smart people

122
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:13,610
and what we learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hacks happen</font>

123
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,650
they will always<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen yes there is</font>

124
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">control so integrity checking yes there</font>

125
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,210
is shadow stag yes there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know CPU</font>

126
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,430
level stuff that is being built<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and</font>

127
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:26,508
I'm sure some smart people figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a</font>

128
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,520
way two morrow how to get around it you

129
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:31,339
kind of keep going down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole the</font>

130
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole doesn't end the whole probably</font>

131
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">ends when everything blows up and you</font>

132
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,449
reach the core both attackers and

133
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,540
defenders die or when the matrix finally

134
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:44,170
swallows us

135
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:46,870
but going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the hole is not an option</font>

136
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:51,430
you just you making it harder we're not

137
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:53,710
not really stopping the attack and I

138
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,920
kind of last year I did a talk on

139
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:59,349
steroid how do i encode a browser

140
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,230
exploit entirely on two pixels and

141
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,870
cannot make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it invisible to eyes that</font>

142
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,940

traverse interiors in ways that they

169
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,890
infrastructure goes complex there is

170
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,210
more and more Nakatomi space being added

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:30,150
into everything file formats networks

172
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,679
like stack memory wherever you think

173
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,980
there's some little gaps some little

00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:39,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways in and out that an attacker can use</font>

and traverse through it in a manner not

<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure it just comes</font>

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:59,810
it's given you can't really clamp it

down if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how exploit</font>

183
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:07,729

186
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,640
to write exploit for the laws as fun we

187
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,339
could own everything and then we could

188
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,230
brag about it today if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

189
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,690
write exploits it's a huge effort

190
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,970
there's no publicly<font color="#E5E5E5"> available exploits</font>

191
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,149
around there's that the money has gone

192
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:32,540
up and exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> have kind of gotten</font>

193
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:35,740
really weaponize and they've taken place

194
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:39,319
in like serious offensive tactics so

195
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,510
what does this mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defense the</font>

196
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,329
defenders tried to react against this as

197
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:48,260
well say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we cannot find publicly</font>

198
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:50,029
disclosed bugs and where we try to screw

199
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,740
over the researchers by forcing them

200
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,839
into legal battles so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> researcher</font>

201
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,630
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> no more free bugs will not want to</font>

202
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,300
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they started using it for</font>

203
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:03,589
themselves so what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defenders do</font>

204
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:06,109
they tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy back their bugs enter</font>

205
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:09,770
the concept of bug bounties this is a

206
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,320
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> start the thought process was was</font>

207
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,839
was good it was designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for I mean it</font>

208
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,720
came about for addressing a real need

209
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,089
and the real need was to credit the

210
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,240
researchers for their effort and you

211
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:27,010
know say thank you the problem happened

212
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:30,380
when they started escalating the stakes

213
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:33,020
so from being a thank-you game an

214
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,350
appreciation game it became a money game

215
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:39,410
and as with money the escalation started

216
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:42,500
pretty fast I am NOT going to rent about

217
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:45,649
bug bounties but I am NOT a believer<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

218
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">the present form of bug bounties had it</font>

219
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:50,810
retained the original thought process

220
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:52,880
yeah that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good but you see that</font>

221
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,300
bug bounties did try to fill a reactive

222
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,970
need and what's happened now you have

223
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,240
situations like this bug bounties have

224
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,010
not remained bounties in the true sense

225
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,830
but they've become sort of a trading

226
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,000
platform

227
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:11,160
a a weapons acquisition market if you

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,660
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 diem declaring a bug bounty for</font>

229
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,400
iOS that's not really bug bounty the the

230
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,010
spirit of the bug bounty means a vendor

231
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,240
is buying the bug back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero diem</font>

232
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,760
is definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to give the bug</font>

233
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple not not after they played a</font>

234
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,910
million dollars or now it's like 1.5

235
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:32,610
million and it's it's it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

236
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,640
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> control you're acquiring bugs and</font>

237
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:39,840
then using<font color="#CCCCCC"> it recklessly this is not</font>

238
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was so my I mean my take on</font>

239
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,680
everything reactive is that don't play

240
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,150
this game<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's not going to benefit</font>

241
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,530
you it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to drain you out of</font>

242
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">money and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and publicity and you're</font>

243
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really going to improve much I mean</font>

244
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,560
Apple has now started a private bug

245
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,270
bounty only like eight or nine people

246
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,430
can contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and they'll get</font>

247
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,199
paid well that's sort of like saying

248
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,969
yeah we have an open bug boundary but

249
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,910
not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> open because apple doesn't</font>

250
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:11,330
really like anything open anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

251
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,420
the subject that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can debate later</font>

252
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:18,990
quickly cutting to how how users behave

253
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:23,550
and user behavior is one of my pet

254
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:25,260
points has sort of devolved over over

255
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:29,219
several years especially over the two

256
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:31,830
decades and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with user</font>

257
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:35,690
behavior is where users have remained

258
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:39,150
the same and advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology is</font>

259
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:43,170
advanced sometimes you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to</font>

260
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:46,199
use advanced technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you you know</font>

261
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,900
step into an Airbus and total it this is

262
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,980
what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when users are given what</font>

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think happens when users are</font>

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:57,270
given a smartphone with a camera they do

265
00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:01,290
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I mean why not this was this</font>

266
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:04,410
was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> August so how do you protect user</font>

267
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:06,449
safety when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of enable the user</font>

268
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,939
and made them feel good about<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweeting</font>

269
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,760
pictures of their debit cards<font color="#CCCCCC"> and whose</font>

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,280
fault<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it the banks surely the banks</font>

271
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,430
are going to get blamed but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you</font>

272
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,430
do

273
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:23,949
I there's several points that I you know

274
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,279
agree and disagree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schneier one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

275
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,600
the points that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really agree with is</font>

276
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:32,560
you give the user a choice about

277
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,680
security the users<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to make</font>

278
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:40,209
the right choice about security they

279
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,239
will choose features fun and frolic<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

security any day the pop-up is bugging

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,220
them from dancing pigs they will click

282
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:53,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay just to get to see the dancing pics</font>

283
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:56,519
it's true so we've seen so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

284
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,139
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very reactive approach to defense</font>

285
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,519
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that has Orizon out of</font>

286
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,820
this whole reactive approach of

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,100
Defense's old phenomenon called

288
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,290
compliance something happens in this

289
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,209
compliance being enforced in the name of

290
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,750
security this is a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my</font>

291
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,880
hometown where we have a law that riders

292
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,310
of scooters and motorcycles must wear a

293
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,610
helmet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this picture is compliant</font>

294
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:24,069
but nothing to say about this person's

295
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">wife was riding behind and if she gets</font>

296
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:31,089
if they get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a wreck she will have</font>

297
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,089
to be scraped<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with a spatula it is</font>

298
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,500
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is compliant but it's not secure so</font>

299
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,899
are these guys these guys are all

300
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,709
compliant they probably still are and

301
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:44,470
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting breached the golden</font>

302
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,930
truth you and I know attackers don't

303
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:50,079
follow standards and certifications they

304
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:53,290
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have they never will and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

305
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:58,870
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing to defend in this manner if you</font>

306
00:14:53,290 --> 00:15:00,849
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go to a large conference you see</font>

307
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:05,740
a picture like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so today's infosec</font>

308
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:08,910
defense is kind of boiled down to three

309
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,940
or four major areas you sum it up all

310
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:15,250
infosec defense is all about rules

311
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,639
signatures and updates if we've learned

312
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,690
how to do this for two decades and oh

313
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,089
now we have this new thing called

314
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:25,690
machine learning thrown in as if it's

315
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:28,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything for us where</font>

316
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,550
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is back to the</font>

317
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:33,730
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it's it's about being</font>

318
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,399
reactive<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we know antivirus has</font>

319
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,230
has its limitations I am NOT going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

320
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:43,899
knock it because yeah it served its

321
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:46,089
purpose frustrated me sometimes but we

322
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,399
don't we don't sort of learn lessons

323
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:51,329
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years ago and we have more</font>

324
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,620
statements coming up saying okay we<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop</font>

325
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:56,859
99% of malware attacks before they

326
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,570
happen well that's great you thought

327
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:04,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent would</font>

328
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:06,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">occupy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent malware</font>

329
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:11,170
that really matters in today's age they

330
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,240
end up owning everything well then your

331
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,370
antivirus gets machine trained on this

332
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,260
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll detect it only to be owned</font>

333
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:21,279
by the other one percent of malware and

334
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:24,790
this game keeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on we've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

335
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:28,209
existing strategies simply do not match

336
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:31,120
attacker tactics<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is</font>

337
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:35,050
part one we've you come to a conclusion

338
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,360
this this is not going to be the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

339
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:40,540
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to defend ourselves</font>

340
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:44,589
something's got to change so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

341
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:46,469
that change where are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> headed in terms</font>

342
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:50,380
of defense if you want to do it right

343
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:54,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one thing I known as we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

344
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:58,270
switch our approach from being reactive

345
00:16:54,329 --> 00:17:00,899
to being proactive and in a proactive

346
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:05,439
defense can only happen when you have

347
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:07,990
the proper intelligence gathered to

348
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,740
defend yourselves there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

349
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,780
said about intelligence as well and so

350
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,309
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say so okay you do you mean</font>

351
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,339
that you should get threatened tell

352
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:22,418
feeds heck no there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like little maps</font>

353
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,938
that shoot things against each other so

354
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:30,340
where you get your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> intelligence</font>

355
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:35,290
first thing look within you pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

356
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:37,199
have all the intelligence you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

357
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:42,879
able to defend<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own organization</font>

358
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,580
know yourself is the first approach if

359
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you simply look at your</font>

360
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,389
organization's data must be like

361
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,540
generating a phenomenal amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font>

362
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:55,120
petabytes of data these were all your

363
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,800
intelligence is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing is what do we</font>

364
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,979
do with the data we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

365
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:07,300
extract proper intelligence from it and

366
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:14,140
this brings me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my the rest of my talk</font>

367
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:17,700
on proactive security testing if only

368
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:22,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">infosec learns from high-velocity</font>

369
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,400
ecommerce<font color="#E5E5E5"> and adopts the same process we</font>

370
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,980
will stand a way better chance of

371
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense let me give you an example you</font>

372
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:35,470
see you see a large retailer like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon</font>

373
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:38,530
or a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> e-commerce site not only do</font>

374
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:41,590
they sell very fast but they keep a

375
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,389
watch on every transaction where is the

376
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,760
user looking how are they clicking can

377
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,530
we shorten the clicks are they using

378
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,170
more mobile phones are they using more

379
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,629
browsers what's the bottlenecks in

380
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:57,970
delivery can I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I shorten this curve</font>

381
00:18:52,630 --> 00:19:00,040
it's all about analysis and actions this

382
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,990
process is very well established they

383
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,780
also generate petabytes or maybe like

384
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:08,500
exabytes of data but they have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power</font>

385
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:11,410
to analyze it surely we can as well when

386
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:14,500
it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to defense so with this I kind</font>

387
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">of thought of seven axioms of security</font>

388
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:22,630
which I want to lay out to give you a

389
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,570
broad guideline of what what meaningful

390
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,560
defense is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be and the first</font>

391
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:33,639
axiom is collect everything by

392
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:37,720
everything I mean everything this

393
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,930
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this is proven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of our</font>

394
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,570
customers did it they started collecting

395
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,640
every HTTP request on all their web

396
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,129
facing applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a bank in</font>

397
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States they started</font>

398
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,350
collecting every HTTP request since 2009

399
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,020
they have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few petabytes of data</font>

400
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,230
in a homegrown Hadoop cluster and

401
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've kept it</font>

402
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,830
they just started<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing we're</font>

403
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,919
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect it and see what we get</font>

404
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:07,409
and then they started running modeling

405
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,990
and analysis on it trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect</font>

406
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:13,549
patterns frauds were happening and then

407
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:17,580
they try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look what led to the fraud</font>

408
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:19,889
historical data is your biggest asset in

409
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">this case and from this historical data</font>

410
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,059
they learned so many things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

411
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:29,580
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve their own homegrown</font>

412
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:32,760
fraud detection by so much that the the

413
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,580
frauds our way minimized and the program

414
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">essentially pays for itself they also</font>

415
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,710
and the cost it was like about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 250</font>

416
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,770
thousand dollars to fill up the hardware

417
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">and another similar amount like</font>

418
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">three-quarters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a million dollar to</font>

419
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,129
run this program year<font color="#CCCCCC"> after year and</font>

420
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,570
there is nothing compared to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

421
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:55,500
frauds they say if they were saving

422
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:58,200
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 425 million in frauds simply using</font>

423
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,650
this this this strategy and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> strategy</font>

424
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,900
was based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security data warehouse</font>

425
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,000
as they called it now that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

426
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,429
step to proactive security and that's

427
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,700
what set me thinking saying wait a

428
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:14,460
minute this is the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go here and</font>

429
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,710
look at Moore's<font color="#E5E5E5"> law Moore's law has</font>

430
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,320
proved that retention is cheaper than

431
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">deletion I haven't deleted anything from</font>

432
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,750
a computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over like five years have</font>

433
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:26,850
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten a bigger hard drive and so</font>

434
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,190
we it doesn't matter BB google code

435
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,168
every little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bite you can it costs you</font>

436
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,240
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to store it in fact it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

437
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:38,940
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more painful to scrub it</font>

438
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:41,520
properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the more valuable I mean</font>

439
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,640
the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> aged the data collects the more</font>

440
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,590
valuable it gets like a good vintage

441
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,840
there is i mean the the value of

442
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:53,820
historical data increases exponentially

443
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:56,428
with time whenever something happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

444
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,070
can always go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look and really</font>

445
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:01,919
narrow down several root causes which

446
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,570
you never knew this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

447
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answers for everything but it's</font>

448
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,178
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help you arrive at conclusions</font>

449
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,179
really quickly

450
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:17,330
now what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do after you collect</font>

451
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:21,260
everything this the second axiom is if

452
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:23,389
you can't measure it you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this</font>

453
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,180
thought process came from a talk given

454
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,670
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marcus raynham is one of the guys I</font>

455
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,820
respect very much and he was speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

456
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">IIT defense earlier this year in January</font>

457
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,950
in mines and I woke<font color="#E5E5E5"> up actually early</font>

458
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:39,919
for his keynote one of the few key notes

459
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:43,130
that I attended<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he made a point that</font>

460
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,800
security is all about metrics what our

461
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,650
matrix matrix are nothing but measurable

462
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,790
units of info SEC or measurable units of

463
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:56,210
anything and it is is like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

464
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:57,950
need metrics for several things to

465
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,110
either show that you're succeeding or

466
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,670
failing these are basically his slides

467
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:06,850
that I want to repeat over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

468
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:09,470
essentially to take informed decisions

469
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:13,159
his talk was all about how to establish

470
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,540
matrix at a very high level so you look

471
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,450
through your process and make a note of

472
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:21,409
what's quantifiable measure it track it

473
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:24,980
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up or down and the real</font>

474
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,040
reason why matrix are very important it

475
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,110
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide which I like very much</font>

476
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,180
it's what he called a battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two</font>

477
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,860
narratives and this is typically what

478
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,320
happens when decisions are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being taken</font>

479
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,969
like some wizard will come and tell you

480
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,460
that oh by moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the cloud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you will</font>

481
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,530
save half a million dollars per year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

482
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,210
they're pulling numbers from thin air

483
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,300
they're pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what</font>

484
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing nothing more than a while</font>

485
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,300
thought over a cup of coffee<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

486
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a business case</font>

487
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:55,250
out of it the only way you can call

488
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,500
bullshit on it is if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> metrics so</font>

489
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,840
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

490
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">his way and and your initiatives are</font>

491
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,280
going to be sideways if you have the

492
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,380
matrix you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either credibly defend</font>

493
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,180
against it or justify what you're

494
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,470
thinking of or maybe actually even prove

495
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,260
that they're right and take the right

496
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,180
decision in this case I love the random

497
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,890
statement is if you can't defend then

498
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,970
plan B is to come up with lies of your

499
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:21,800
own if you don't have matrix but

500
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:25,430
I have seen this with<font color="#E5E5E5"> C source</font>

501
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:27,560
throughout the years the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main blockage</font>

502
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,810
for security is somebody from marketing

503
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,270
comes and says oh if you do this user

504
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to suffer there's no</font>

505
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,629
way of measuring how many users<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

506
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,880
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to suffer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm going to talk</font>

507
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,950
about users in a little bit where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

508
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,160
actually measured and realize how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

509
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,200
users<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to suffer well go for it</font>

510
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,760
there's always collateral damage we've

511
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,710
kind of become numb to it haven't win

512
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:56,210
today's day and age right the third

513
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:58,190
axiom is if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test test</font>

514
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,310
like an attacker I mean if you want to

515
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,800
do red team do red team thoroughly I

516
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:06,230
have several instances of me walking

517
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,090
into a red team engagement and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

518
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,280
customer kind of starts throwing

519
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,290
different rules like oh wait we got to

520
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,460
wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a production release don't test</font>

521
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,850
on production you're going to kill it

522
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">well that's the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dammit don't</font>

523
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">perform intrusive testing what's a</font>

524
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,440
non-intrusive penetration test i mean

525
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,600
the the words are just conflicting

526
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,770
aren't they and then oh yeah this is out

527
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,240
of scope that is out of scope that is

528
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:33,290
out of scope so what do you want me to

529
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,910
do walk on the carpet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah this</font>

530
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:38,020
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite Oh test during off-peak</font>

531
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:41,300
hours basically from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 a.m. to four am</font>

532
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:43,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked them</font>

533
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,680
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok who are you more scared of are</font>

534
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,199
you scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attackers or auditors and</font>

535
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,120
make a choice if you're scared of the

536
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,710
auditor is a get a compliance report<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

537
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">will give you one for free and go away</font>

538
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:58,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">he'll be all green save your time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> siva</font>

539
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,050
money don't bother me but if it is

540
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,360
attackers you're worried about all these

541
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:06,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">rules don't apply just do what an</font>

542
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:09,740
attacker does coming to users this is

543
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:13,430
axiom for and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of was inspired</font>

544
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,820
by a tweet debate between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> grog who</font>

545
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:18,530
is a very dear friend of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and SP</font>

546
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,080
it's like it's high time we paid

547
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,879
attention to user ratings we've always

548
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,570
talked about users you always told<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

549
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,070
user is stupid no they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not they can</font>

550
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">be incredibly smart and incredibly</font>

551
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,360
stupid and there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a curve we've</font>

552
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,559
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize where we are with it</font>

553
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,370
that's what's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a big</font>

554
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:41,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference in our info SEC landscape so</font>

555
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:45,030
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was the the origins of the</font>

556
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:47,250
discussion is the statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that user</font>

557
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,100
hardening efforts have barely made any

558
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,710
progress compared to software hardening

559
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,689
over the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> year's and it is time we</font>

560
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,240
look at this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously from an</font>

561
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:00,600
organization's point of view it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

562
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:04,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay using metrics using data that you</font>

563
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,629
collect who are your users who are they

564
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,940
what are they how mature are they in

565
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:11,600
terms of infosec practices and your

566
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:15,000
typical curve will always look like this

567
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of users on the low</font>

568
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,919
maturity curve to begin with the moment

569
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:23,159
you start measuring you start seeing

570
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:27,270
this bell curve appear and then what do

571
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:29,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do here and of classify them you you</font>

572
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:32,580
know there's there's a hopeless users

573
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:36,000
yeah there's uninformed users the pro

574
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:39,720
active users and the rock stars now

575
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,450
every user is different you cannot use

576
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,919
the same treatment for every user this

577
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,309
is the one big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that organisations</font>

578
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,640
are doing and failing if you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

579
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:54,540
force me to change my password 12 times

580
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,150
a year i will<font color="#CCCCCC"> start writing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it down you</font>

581
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:00,270
know it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way you you</font>

582
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:03,049
cannot apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lowest common</font>

583
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,460
denominator across your entire user base

584
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:07,379
so what do we do first of all the

585
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,660
hopeless users<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're always</font>

586
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,150
going to be an enigma you give them

587
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:17,250
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do something stupid out</font>

588
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:18,960
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it leave them alone right on the</font>

589
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">other hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you of the rock stars leave</font>

590
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,080
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone too because they are doing</font>

591
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right thing maybe you want to learn</font>

592
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,980
from them maybe you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> convert your</font>

593
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:30,389
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pro active users to be rock stars</font>

594
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:34,710
too but your main target area are the

595
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:36,600
uninformed users this middle segment the

596
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:39,090
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about these people is if you</font>

597
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,570
guide them they<font color="#CCCCCC"> will end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the</font>

598
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:45,240
right thing so your goal is to kind of

599
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,870
shift the curve take the slice of

600
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,990
uninformed users

601
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:52,419
and push him more proactive if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep</font>

602
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:55,210
moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> the graph this way and you keep</font>

603
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,130
tracking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metrics I believe you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

604
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,180
very good game going and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can be</font>

605
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,580
done through several things through

606
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,610
technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> from messaging sort of like</font>

607
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,559
you know user feedback continuously AK

608
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,240
your updo using an old browser do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

609
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,670
want to update because if you don't then

610
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,550
where this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stop working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

611
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:15,120
be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Clippy that that is</font>

612
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:18,760
not call being proactive user<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

613
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,100
right fifth axiom is to set booby traps

614
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,440
and this was inspired<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a dear friend</font>

615
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:26,260
of mine her own mere who actually has

616
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,900
built his company on selling Canaries

617
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:32,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> canary tokens I mean it's it's time</font>

618
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,460
that honey tokens made a comeback you

619
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,919
know see where your<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is going</font>

620
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,480
market mark your data mark your

621
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:42,070
transactions and keep an eye on them I

622
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,679
have suffered<font color="#E5E5E5"> three credit card frauds</font>

623
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,200
in this past one year fall from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Citibank</font>

624
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:48,820
they showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a new card every time and</font>

625
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,850
then it something happens it gets

626
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:57,250
breached and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe i am not a stupid</font>

627
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:59,770
user something's happened now this

628
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,350
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> i started thinking they issue</font>

629
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,000
credit cards and batches what have<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

630
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,719
end up retaining a few cards themselves

631
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,480
and these few cards will never be used

632
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,220
and just just program these credit card

633
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,980
numbers into anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that takes a</font>

634
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,559
regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> expression the moment you see</font>

635
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">activity on these unused credit cards</font>

636
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if it is simple lookup query be</font>

637
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,340
very aware like okay what's happening

638
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,860
track down<font color="#CCCCCC"> your process and you see you</font>

639
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">see where this data is moving on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

640
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,979
internet you kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch where the</font>

641
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,139
leaks were catch with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the breaches were</font>

642
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,140
and figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> something's happening</font>

643
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,620
before it really explodes you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

644
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,640
like one canary in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole batch</font>

645
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,590
invalidate the batch you know reissue

646
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,550
them proactively before fraud start

647
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:47,699
happening I mean this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way of</font>

648
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:50,500
seriously actively defending against

649
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,720
against these threats encourage you

650
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,450
highly to read read up about canary

651
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,380
tokens and see any youtube videos of her

652
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:03,250
own stock it's very very inspiring

653
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:06,130
sixth axiom is that analysis decides

654
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:07,960
actions<font color="#CCCCCC"> corollaries basically you will</font>

655
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:11,470
not take any action without proper

656
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,510
analysis so fair warning for this one

657
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,850
there's a few block diagrams ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

658
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:20,650
generally don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like block diagrams what</font>

659
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:22,480
I am going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use them so the way you</font>

660
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,490
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I saw</font>

661
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,780
with one of my banking customers the

662
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,870
guys would build thick petabyte

663
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:32,139
warehouse is every new estimate they

664
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:35,649
kind of first estimated what impact it

665
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:38,380
would have so they decided very early on

666
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:41,320
that we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not allow I six to eight in</font>

667
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,910
our organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they met with a lot</font>

668
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flack saying oh you're going to do</font>

669
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,120
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to break so many users</font>

670
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,980
and they came back<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying no we're going</font>

671
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to break like about thirteen percent of</font>

672
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,720
users let's break<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's okay the</font>

673
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:56,080
rest of the eighty-seven percent will

674
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,610
not complain and we will manage this so

675
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,649
they estimated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would have</font>

676
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:03,129
about a week worth of customer calls and

677
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,840
customer support issues and they

678
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,520
launched the initiative they started

679
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,129
tracking it they started tracking it

680
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,629
over two weeks and found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that ok</font>

681
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,540
didn't take a week it probably took a

682
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:15,870
whole month that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok but then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they kind</font>

683
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,129
of went back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the feedback loop and</font>

684
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,260
reviser process is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

685
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:23,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduce some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new initiatives and</font>

686
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,910
started started pushing changes where

687
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,790
initially every change is met with

688
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:30,520
resistance here you have a proactive way

689
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:34,290
of pushing changes with proper effect

690
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:38,280
and tracking<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go I</font>

691
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:41,350
drew a basic blueprint for a proactive

692
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,149
security defense architecture it's

693
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:46,000
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like everything has to feed</font>

694
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,310
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security data warehouse every</font>

695
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,390
application user activity perimeter

696
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:57,100
activity collect analyze and then

697
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:59,320
trigger actions wherever they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

698
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:03,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and that leads me to the last and</font>

699
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:06,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the seventh axiom of of info SEC which</font>

700
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:09,040
is a hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> one to solve hard as for the</font>

701
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,090
last and this requires buying from the

702
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,129
top

703
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:16,840
this is where the most resistance

704
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:20,260
happens the sad part is that info SEC is

705
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,209
still a cost Center to most

706
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,580
organizations it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a money-making</font>

707
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:27,070
machine and because it isn't a

708
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:30,668
money-making machine it takes the

709
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:33,010
sidelines<font color="#E5E5E5"> the approach is okay how how</font>

710
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:35,049
much can we optimize spending<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec</font>

711
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,629
and how can we like minimize his budget

712
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:40,179
and just get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the job done just don't get</font>

713
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:41,890
the auditors in my face and oh I don't

714
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to be on the press all over these</font>

715
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:49,450
are the overall goals given to any<font color="#CCCCCC"> C so</font>

716
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,429
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not want to change the the cost</font>

717
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Center approach is not going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change I</font>

718
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,419
mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how info sex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

719
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:58,210
start making money for you unless you

720
00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:59,590
like tell your banking red team to go

721
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,649
attack other banks and steal money from

722
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:08,049
them but otherwise you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> no make</font>

723
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:11,199
money so what do you do I was then going

724
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:13,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the job role of a Cecil and here</font>

725
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:18,310
is what a seesaw needs to do it's a huge

726
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:19,989
time suck with with today's today's

727
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:22,750
responsibilities on the modern seesaw

728
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:26,638
but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you kind of find a little</font>

731
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:36,460
free up ninety percent of the time that

732
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:37,839
I see so as to spend and this ten

733
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,060
percent you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it very</font>

734
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,339
well but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that little corner is</font>

735
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,879
something that says compliance and

736
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:47,949
audits compliance and audits are not

737
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:49,598
enforced sick in fact if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

738
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:52,569
make an organizational change in the

739
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,570
organization create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new business unit</font>

740
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:57,609
that gels just deals with audits sit

741
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,320
them in a corner pay them some money and

742
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,900
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell them not to make noise do</font>

743
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,390
whatever they need to do but please move

744
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,220
this functionality from under the sea so

745
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:09,160
and put it somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else because</font>

746
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:13,209
honestly it's not their surface not

747
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:16,750
they're monkeys info sexy source need to

748
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:19,750
be creative and need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make something</font>

749
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:22,240
not scramble to keep on complying and

750
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,050
fulfilling all the hassles from all

751
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,029
sides

752
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:28,780
this is going to seriously free up

753
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:31,810
ninety percent of the time and then you

754
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,440
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question is your info SEC team</font>

00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:38,590
doing something creative every day

756

rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just responding to rules</font>

757
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:47,110
signatures updates and compliance

758
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:53,080
requests so well that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the</font>

759
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:56,200
end of my talk I just have to do this I

760
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:59,080
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> this hat at 44 gone a friend make it</font>

761
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:03,460
made it so it's time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make security</font>

762
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:08,590
great again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's what it says</font>

763
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:17,920
thank you very much questions any

764
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:20,740
comments any questions the security hats

765
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,320
you can contact Joe Fitzpatrick he makes

766
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:28,060
these really nice make security great

767
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:31,530
again he'll probably give him to you we

768
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,529
have a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the back yes</font>

769
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:46,359
objective method of communicating to

770
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:49,500
upper yeah so the objective metrics for

771
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:53,350
communicating to the upper<font color="#E5E5E5"> echelons</font>

772
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,850
first of all failure rates and show that

773
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:59,770
if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure rates can be</font>

774
00:36:54,850 --> 00:37:03,549
minimized attempts of attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

775
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:05,470
happened user classification is a big

776
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,450
thing like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's here's the users</font>

777
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:11,529
that we have and give you an example

778
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:13,720
about users we had 11 bank in<font color="#E5E5E5"> India roll</font>

779
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,700
out a fingerprint based banking

780
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,220
initiative and they made a statement

781
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with this we are going to get</font>

782
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,169
rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of passwords forever and everybody</font>

783
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">can use their fingerprints to log into</font>

784
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:28,660
internet banking from their phones the

785
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:31,600
the fallacy here that was not backed up

786
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,600
by numbers is that very few devices are

787
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,970
touch touch ID enabled or fingerprint

788
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,200
enabled so for the vast majority

789
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:41,230
still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be usernames and</font>

790
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,029
passwords even for the users who have

791
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,890
the touch ID if they drop their phone in

792
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,619
the toilet and get like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cheap knockoff</font>

793
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,598
phone then they will degrade back to

794
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,430
username and passwords so do the

795
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,810
attacker touch ID means just simply

796
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:58,480
degrading to a lower quality hardware

797
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:01,049
device and you get it so these once you

798
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,810
have these type of metrics put in place

799
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:06,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make a very convincing point</font>

800
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,650
rest of it depends totally on the

801
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,359
initiative<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to launch you</font>

802
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:13,570
think of an initiative like say a

803
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:15,190
browser upgrade or you know do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

804
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,930
more mobile users you want to even

805
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,270
invest more money into web-based

806
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:21,868
applications reduce to start 10 killing

807
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:25,359
like still slowly start killing them

808
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:28,090
that's what it's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I i wish i</font>

809
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,619
knew the the answers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe i can</font>

810
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:32,830
make like some process and offer

811
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:38,530
certification around it and then drive

812
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:40,509
compliance no sorry any others yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

813
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:42,730
have one actually go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

814
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:48,190
move audit and compliance away from the

815
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:51,580
sea so yeah move it where<font color="#E5E5E5"> to another</font>

816
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:53,020
department which department well you

817
00:38:51,580 --> 00:39:01,060
know in Germany they started creating

818
00:38:53,020 --> 00:39:07,720
bad banks that's you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create an</font>

819
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:10,359
audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> department I guess marketing so</font>

820
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:13,509
I'm very see so no no seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

821
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:16,089
it's a I mean humor aside I'll tell you

822
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this job is like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> full-time job in</font>

823
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:21,549
itself if you put the two together the

824
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,990
Cecil's never the the infosec

825
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,599
organization will never get an

826
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,669
opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be creative the only way</font>

827
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,310
is you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move it out let order do</font>

828
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:33,130
its audit job<font color="#CCCCCC"> cesar's go to survive the</font>

829
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:35,859
audit period but let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

830
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">budget at all right so if you look at</font>

831
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:41,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the whole thing there the mind map for</font>

832
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:44,859
CISOs yeah the red box is my biggest

833
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:47,650
elephant to get budget without that box

834
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:50,060
my budget decreases and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to fight</font>

835
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:59,130
so much harder for any budget

836
00:39:50,060 --> 00:40:02,640
budget thingies are here yeah use

837
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:05,100
metrics<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get other parts of budget but</font>

838
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,839
if it's a classic denim says I'm sorry

839
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,700
but in four seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost center</font>

840
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,160
right you said it is a columnist ases

841
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:15,210
organization still view it as such it is

842
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,740
a cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> center</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> until the bigwigs see that</font>

843
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:19,440
it is stopping other money from

00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,450
hemorrhaging the way many<font color="#E5E5E5"> Caesars</font>

845
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,540
actually successfully implement metrics

846
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:26,549
and show business value is by you put

847
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,890
numbers you put money actual monetary

848
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:30,990
values yet risks yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a risk</font>

849
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,629
reduction is a monetary benefit to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

850
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,850
corporation right but then you need to

851
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:40,080
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk and the compliance of the</font>

852
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:43,009
audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the gaps in security so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

853
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:47,700
you can measure and monetize on

854
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:50,760
mitigation risk mitigation that's I mean

855
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,049
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true we are stuck in this the</font>

856
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,300
thing is do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

857
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,910
loop or not there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

858
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,400
this I mean that's fine we want to get

859
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,740
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this loop I do something</font>

860
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,570
different or just still keep on doing

861
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:09,419
