1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,290
her own as a on government out

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,309
director for 10 will never scare Z makes
messes

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,469
you for your interest so I wanna
projects I'm working on my man

4
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:19,880
is helping connect security to the
business helping people

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,930
understand why skiers important things
really big deal for a lot of us

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,099
a whenever going into its complete is
question they say

7
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:29,830
between the security

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,560
a

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,439
a

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,030
an example of that business is talking
they say

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,449
always kills and of course I what
they're actually saying is

12
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:43,670
I'm really scared one hearing bout with
Scott we got security

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,350
you got shellshock the next new from
ability with a beautiful Logan

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,489
I am as well as a hotly and

15
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:55,399
the reason why they don't miss and
security is because we're talking about

16
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,089
bits and bytes we talking about

17
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:00,399
a SSL encryption we're talking about

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,140
I am yep with all this new far will win
so when they ask is always secure we

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,630
giving them the wrong on Sat and so

20
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,909
the thing offering beary constrain of
the last three years is

21
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,920
counter should communicate effectively
with the CEO the company

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,979
with a very high a person I realize one

23
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,090
very fundamental thing is businesses

24
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,420
don't give a shit about security because

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,759
they don't understand it what they do
understand though is measurements

26
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,750
to talk to nece I you or any business
leader

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,440
they understand measurements and they'll
send a few commish something you can't

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,140
control it

29
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,310
and so good flashy

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,050
so well I've been working on is a
building

31
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,110
communicating metrics it do matter

32
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,319
and I think something that you can ship
consider

33
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,500
I when talking had to mention basket ISE

34
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,569
I simple metrics the you can use

35
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:02,429
by the way these are signs top 20
effectiveness metrics us to be worth

36
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:03,140
reading into

37
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,920
I know what is the time takes but critic
easy easy disposal for an ability for

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,940
business unit breeze warmed up a
business unit or the reason why you

39
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,590
should do by

40
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,819
for business use people competitive so
let's say I measured myself my measure

41
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,230
this young gentleman issue with this
stunning hacker

42
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,629
I'm how long the if I'm peacing him he's
gonna try and be made

43
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,690
and so if i've patch my things

44
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,390
in three days he takes 10 he's going to
try and speed up and be as good as I'm

45
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,200
which you never will be I'm same
aggressive sensitive systems with

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,159
malware defense

47
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,860
if you look at the target breach this is
something that we should be detecting

48
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,500
and because the you know they have a
reporter rich and they also ignore the

49
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:41,930
labs

50
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,510
I was the time taken to a tense 19
assets on the network 802 11 X

51
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,710
is great but not lobby will use it I'm
how quickly can identify things and then

52
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,350
also you

53
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,220
how quickly can I i understand whether
that system got from ability on it and

54
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,550
then

55
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,150
things are corporate security policies
well how r each of our business units

56
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,320
i working I am against this corporate
security policies I

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,140
measuring these things put them on
simple dashboard in fact I i

58
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,870
achievements just using sunlight

59
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,380
in program like a scissor technical guys
been always a nice flash when it comes

60
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,080
to design

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,739
I if you use an IM program to present
these types of measurements to the

62
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,350
business

63
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,940
the result to understand it a man

64
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,170
you need to also align the security
issues to the business risk

65
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,850
okay quite often we talk about very very
complex things that we need to mitigate

66
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,500
the business doesn't care if it doesn't
impact the business he's not risk to the

67
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,090
business

68
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,100
then it's is not a risk to them at all
okay

69
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,150
you not gonna get funding to mitigate
security risks you can get funding to

70
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,690
miss gay

71
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,739
a business risk more flash

72
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,940
skier got some I am

73
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,350
if you want to it'll be more about some
the effectiveness metrics that I've been

74
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,250
working on and

75
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,510
helping communicates we see so using
CIA's businesses a Grampy

76
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,230
I will be drinking I'm or you can I
follow me on twitter

77
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,549
will drop me an email think very much
