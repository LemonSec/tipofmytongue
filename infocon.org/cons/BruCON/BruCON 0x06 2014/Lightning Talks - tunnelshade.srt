00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,290
hi guys a an engineering student from
India

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,250
she have to clap for that it have a long
way to attend the school conferencia

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,369
want it to be among some people so 'em

4
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:20,730
up flashbang what is it

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,590
its flash grenade you stand people you
through it to play shooting date:

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,460
up so in that application security even
though the plane's

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,710
loving your day to analyze i flash
fights a

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,880
if they are not properly coded Letty a

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,239
but colette was the general procedure
used the

10
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,590
the a the you be gone by the flashlight
looked at the source code and you then

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,680
alleged statically already have few
tools the

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,250
which do the same thing automatically
Lake they become by late for you and

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,239
then then lays and

14
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,570
day show you some red flags ok at

15
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,290
so what is this this

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,960
is a project the the chase to cover

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,590
mmm almost the many oz in many aspects
of

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,010
testing a flash file for across a
stooping 18 ability

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,990
so up yeah up you will need to have
knowledge if anything you just

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,510
a need to put in the flash file into the
flash bang it will

21
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,140
do the magic for you a the Viet bike
this

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,799
this is written in jail escape will come
to that latest dial escape

23
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,570
for civil can you please raise your
right hand once

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,040
quick quick hell if I minutes please who

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,810
to understanding what I speak late
yesterday people don't understand unions

26
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,280
easy

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,150
so have an Indian so

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,150
the second they might not be mine that
is me

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,820
you must be doing my deal a flash-bang
is built upon

30
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,860
and was it a technology glitch ambition
me is quite famous

31
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,460
much to the people run Flash files on
their browser using

32
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,030
Adobe plugin backed this is an alternate
actually which much less I get an open

33
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,740
source project

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,790
so they believe the VM using up

35
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,549
is jim is a technology and Alastair
which allows you to run flashlights

36
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,420
%uh which is open source so what

37
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,490
the the ideal flashbang actually is

38
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,890
really creative Lake you have a

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,080
do you have something which runs a flash
fail a

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,330
what is the best way you can use it just
place

41
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,790
looks at the right point in the player
and expect the information you need

42
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,610
that is really effective so show flash
ben was based on top of some miss

43
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,400
overuse

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,370
the summit which had machine I'm Lord
flash failing to it

45
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,060
and then get the information which would
equate a

46
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,239
yeah I'm sancho Maybach sports what
actions to do an ActionScript 3

47
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,260
flash pen works for both that's when
it's ok but why is flashbang effectively

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,290
up Lake what is stacked that

49
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,470
other flash analysis to lose our scripts
do not provide

50
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,560
up flash members protections and due
dates one

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,680
is us tactical early detection and I
that is it and a metal detection

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,769
most at the given detection is somewhat
similar to what I wanted it or you just

53
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:11,370
the

54
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,530
Lake begun by the source for nunu LASIK

55
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,130
which is one thing defend the landing a
detection is

56
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,920
a big difference Lake then I'll

57
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,390
flash medieval aims which get calculated
on the play and then this Devin

58
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,750
flashlight actually runs

59
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,870
so then you statically by Glendale AZ
you really don't

60
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,680
the understanding you really don't get a
how the flash financial

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,970
static analysis phase in those scenarios

62
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,370
so you need and even as for that and in
order to improve the cloud coverage as

63
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:42,760
well

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,600
I'll might have already simulated using
easy to use event which is neat as it is

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,260
late for example in some cases

66
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,630
and even the Lake I suppose

67
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,709
other notable call is triggered only on
on

68
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,500
a that legal for use it audit up a man
who type so much so that Zoe

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,940
you need to stimulate does he wants to
get the maximum coverage survey testing

70
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,640
something so

71
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,970
this is also really important and this
has been made possible only because of

72
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,450
some day because

73
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,880
it runs in the browser so it is easy to
gendered evens yeah

74
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,130
as of now we have this capability to
text

75
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,680
even a single also that is a type of
Colleges

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,950
wit if used in a wrong way can lead to
end

77
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,860
process to pick one over 80 so this is
the UA

78
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,639
actually the display temple is not up
since it has completed an indigenous

79
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,910
nothing gets uploaded not it you just
open the fight

80
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,020
you and then everything runs in your
browser to use your own

81
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,230
the have to upload anything that and is
set stuff so once you select

82
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,169
flash million year you will get an
answer something like that it will

83
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,860
detect all the flash that it was

84
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,080
the the dictating cause you can now

85
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,660
eddie and then assessment division
change so

86
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,490
yeah deal this is so the log bitch you
not all

87
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,150
it brings all the information like
what's happening in the background so

88
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,600
yet this is still important Lake up

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,270
this tool get is delivered I'm

90
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,950
if you want the supported you can do
multiple things Lake

91
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,360
you know submit issues open bugs

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,990
are yep you these are the links if you
want to contribute and

93
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,990
yet again meet me if you want to watch a
column of the student looking
