00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,660
hello I'll

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,510
thanks for staying five minutes reach
okay so

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,590
cv-22 all its old its

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,730
everyone I hope kinda knows what it's
about

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,330
very important lied about me take it all
in

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,250
i'm talking about all shit this is
really all 2012 everyone knows what it's

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:30,680
about

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,670
it's not cool shit sizzle shit I'm

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,840
it's basically remote code execution in
PHP

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,300
you would have probably seen it it looks
kind of like that

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,820
in your patch logs and that's not really
that easy to read because it's white

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,449
and black and it's on it's been far away
so let's take a closer look at it

13
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:54,210
first line is my blog access log

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,839
the attacking I pitched I mean the I
digits coming towards me

15
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:03,859
am or trying to request that page date
blah blah blah

16
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,500
its posts and then it's the a call to
see job in PHP blah blah blah you'll see

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,890
this right hands up who see this

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,080
so you'll know what I'm talking about
saying go home

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,940
awesome pets you can decode the

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,000
the basic the the encoded stuff they it
doesn't really give us anything

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,410
useful because it's tiny text that you
can see on the screen but thats

22
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,560
and the decoded bit but the problem with
that is

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,980
it's the that it's not the post stated
that that you know it's

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,670
the poster is where all the good stuff
so we need something to get to that post

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,200
eight er

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,400
which is a Class toughest Lucas here
johnson's here

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,470
because is not here Lucas rights on

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,230
honey pots of nickel glass of what it
does is it says yes

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,810
on this phone piece a web software and
it takes and everything

30
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,850
and then you get stuff back in hospital
reports

31
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,210
that looks kinda like that this is a
horrible script that I wrote to you to

32
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,250
pull out information

33
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,700
but this is a similar request except the
CIA at the bottom the thats

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,200
the post a to boring anyway

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,030
times gone and solicit take a look at
another one this is another attack from

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,110
somewhere in the world and you can see
the posted at the

37
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,260
there's a it's calling PHP system to run
ID find out who we are

38
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,300
run kill on dot K log D because that's

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,610
great idea and CD entertained directory

40
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,680
remove old stuff make new stuff and get
are payload

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,470
an which is usually like an RC bottle
something like that

42
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,220
and this is all we really talking about
its its remote code execution

43
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,230
pulled on files from remote service onto
your webserver

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,760
execute them extract them whatever the
case may be these are some examples

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,900
love it particular tech attacking my
machine

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,880
it's all pills the dust stuff which is
fairly boring

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,870
I did get very interesting sample a
while back at

48
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,550
CCC Ron CCC time I'd didn't have axis it
now because I'm a retard

49
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,810
but it was six false met

50
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,140
tune-ups files to on files and to x86
files

51
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,260
we didn't quite figure out what they're
doing but

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,450
be think it was some sort of the Duster
I'm not Service Engineer

53
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,500
at all so I did reverse it reminded

54
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,520
it was interesting this was an issue 1

55
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,040
recently wall of text and same stuff for
the type

56
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,260
but it's basically and three different
variables

57
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,190
which is Bay 64 encoded of binaries
safety check this whole wall of text

58
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,640
into

59
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,720
p pay 64 decoder you get elf binary

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,290
they were 30 funny still

61
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,310
batteries that buffer if and buffer to
you are the two of binaries

62
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,860
and manages dumpsters to fall runs runs
and

63
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,540
change the the missions on and then runs
at and thus

64
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,230
is you dee da spot that's going around
the world

65
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,770
dozen people because the doses orson
looks like that and that's pretty much

66
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,530
what I'm talking about this is all I'm
releasing on my honey pot

67
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,470
is just or indeed us gets better
instinct so what going to take away from

68
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,910
this

69
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,850
it's really bad for us good guys

70
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,970
bad guys love it because it

71
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,750
it's you picture goldfish in portables
what I want you to take away from the

72
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,380
statue should always get like a dog in a
mustache

73
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,740
and prefer be don't use PHP because it's
part a crap

74
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,230
I'm sites products wonderful and

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,450
thank you babies
