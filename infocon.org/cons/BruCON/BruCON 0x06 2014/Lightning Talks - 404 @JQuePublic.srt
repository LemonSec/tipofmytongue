1
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,690
okay a.m.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,240
about some forensics first I was
thinking

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,450
talking about 12 Parsons Flying Circus
but I want to

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,800
take another topic let's talk about

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,189
pp to condone stockings everybody knows
is

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,320
little girls sure this in a very clean
houses animals and stuff and have very

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,170
clear life

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,390
so she's a bit crazy so we need to talk
to base for this

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,399
to structure a life am

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,290
as a set we have a lot of annuals in
this house and

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,430
any notes a very different kind so

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,520
we have coast we have horses you have
pics

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,640
they have different colors and you can
create a table out at out of this

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,020
so if the tables called an email to the
author animal ID with a name and a color

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,750
I'm sorry that this is in German but I
was too lazy to translate everything

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,030
English Luke from time to time

17
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,150
you need some forensics a.m.

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,720
my si quote so what should be do peaked
at goat

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,470
to wallet into database name there are
some frm files

20
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,670
missed a complete database structure
isn't index

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,710
so be don't have any time

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,450
for reading it manually so I wrote a
little pies in script quintuplets

23
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,150
textile aunt pops out to complete
database structure

24
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,670
so going to prove it in the topless

25
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,370
the result of my script and it's totally
equal to the scribe database

26
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,470
so this good for us it's proof no

27
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,640
nets put some stuff from the database so
we have a great horse

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,890
bf broke it if a clue talk blue docs
don't exist so

29
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,200
let's say if a white talk so my secret
history service

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,860
okay in South something something
whatever update animal set

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,790
kind of quiet well color is blue for
forensics

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,979
we can go and Guadalupe my sequel and

33
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,340
there are three files I would look
photos I will look for one

34
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,090
and the it down to one wasn't these
files are all

35
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,860
SQL statements what twenty bullets like
insert

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,500
update and

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,430
delete I wrote a items to for this

38
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,980
so the coast and the files and
reconstruct everything

39
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,250
what happens in the database those
hearts 5 NP

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,629
pic each statements about 402 of bytes

41
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,120
so we have a lot of statements you can
reconstruct /url

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,299
to be honest this crypt doesn't booked

43
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:42,000
that good because as you see here

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,049
set column 3.rar the it's nothing that
should be

45
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,730
something like wide because you changed
pluto wide

46
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,849
but we find

47
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:57,329
all the books so at this point even bet
minutes got about the script it's

48
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,410
totally pocket

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,430
won't work but I have no time to explain
how to do it

50
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,450
in total and populate at the Barbican

51
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,459
talk about it so what to do and we need
a code review built

52
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:13,730
the costs like Peyton Scott so very
could wrap and

53
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,060
I need someone who to litter box

54
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,380
at more parks and add more features and
so on and so on Proby

55
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,239
from just two scripts you can start
project to build up a completely

56
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,269
a complete tool for my school forensics
am

57
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:32,579
next week and I talk at results
different rock about

58
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,750
my super forensics all database and
operating system level so

59
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,799
I guess is less will be a long two into
if you're interested a

60
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,359
in my secret forensic shows coat was
also caught aunt

61
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,910
she's flights am you can catch me on
twitter

62
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,870
on double and my spirits

63
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,489
tightens grip so online on get up well
just let's talk at the bar later

64
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:58,319
so that's all from my site thank you
