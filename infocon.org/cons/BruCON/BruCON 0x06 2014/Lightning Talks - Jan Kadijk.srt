1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,870
tanks

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,370
so automating wired

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,469
air 2.1 X Men in the middle I hope you
all know

4
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:18,140
to one exits away to attends case

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,180
the computer on a switch ports in this
case

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,840
and Kate's and you can be put in a
different feel and

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,700
or just get shut down altogether my
project is

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,620
aimed at the case where if you make one
mistake

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,960
the switchboard goes down and game over
so

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,180
middle this is still set up I used

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,540
a you certain case termite

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,950
BeagleBone to switch

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,970
and to the Gateway its Amanda me know in
the purest sense

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:58,250
Osterhout indication the which which has
only one way of detecting the legitimate

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,770
clients to make a dress

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,060
so if it impersonates the

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,100
to attended user

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,140
a completely there's no way for switch
to detect its

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,789
so some you might be thinking is nothing
new

20
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:18,030
DEFCON 19: Alford up hopes percent to
dismantle I implement

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,380
did that that's where I started and

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,719
Pony Express phone plugged us the same
but

23
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,950
it's really expensive so

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,170
when I set out to do this or not a lot
of scripts available

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,520
and there still room for improvement
this

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,670
and meet Giffords working so

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,149
the when you good connected same subnets

28
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:46,959
with original method there were a lot of
ICMP redirects

29
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,139
because every all traffic is bounced

30
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:54,020
of the default gateway that's something
a network admin

31
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,020
could detect on

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,380
another problem is communication with
clients broken and you might want to do

33
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,110
claimed tax port security

34
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,280
a.m. that took the most times good
working

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,970
you when you send one packet it's game
over

36
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,330
a source for collisions you have to

37
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,960
to set up short sports and if they
collide with the USART

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,930
it might stuff like a broken a

39
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,850
completely determining the configuration
of the network

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,030
automatically I improved upon dats

41
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,990
you have to text the Gateway mac Address
user IP

42
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,760
user mac Address you might want to
detect

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,020
DNS settings and other things you need
are over 18s

44
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,910
I didn't fix that and fiscal texan
that's why I got animated gif

45
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,850
with two ninjas kept by maybe you know
it's can

46
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,590
took solve my solutions on

47
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,590
I figured well you need to our

48
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,230
requests dark table to to stop bouncing
everything

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,390
of the default gateway which come to our
progress post because to colonel

50
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,830
just uses its your Mac dress and you
don't want it

51
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,300
Honda on the network so

52
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,120
I just listen for all Harper quests and
are ProQuest

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,810
work just fine so it's and optimization
basically disable

54
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,230
ipv6 because it's really noisy I used

55
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,830
IP tables denouncing rules and SL sniff
to

56
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,180
attacked a client in some ways instead
of

57
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,460
using

58
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,210
deterministic met its like the most

59
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,570
traffic to the internet or something
that was used by

60
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,290
unplugged and alpha I use detail based
gateway detection

61
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,260
because if it's uneven and not one or
255

62
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,450
is probably the Gateway a

63
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,270
and I have not yet souls short for
collisions or the internal DNS

64
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,270
configuration

65
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,930
so this it it's so on get help

66
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,160
a and if you ask me I can get you in SD
card image

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,720
not now because I've got my reader so
yep thanks
