1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,770
thank you good morning

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,320
Anton thank you all for being awake this
morning after the party last night I

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,730
I appreciate you being here today I want
to talk to you about threat modeling

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,480
lessons from Star Wars

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,500
and really there's three main things i
wanna talk about I want to explain what

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,410
threat modeling

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,650
is I want to cover simple approach

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,320
Chi threat modeling share with you top
ten lessons than

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,420
I've learned over the years in helping
people and a wide variety of

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,650
organizations learn to trust model more
effectively

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,370
and then give you some resources to
learn more superstar down

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,420
what is threat modeling threat modeling
is something we

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,670
all G wits about abstracting away

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,110
details so that you can think about the
threat

15
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,230
if I ask you to strap model houses last
year helped rat model my house

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,530
you might think about someone who's
gonna break in and try and steal the

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,409
stereo

18
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,759
you're probably not gonna worry about
what color shirt they're wearing as they

19
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:10,360
do it

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,840
you're ignoring irrelevant details to
focus

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,119
on a model you might also think about it
in terms

22
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,170
access points like doors and windows

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,619
and use that as a basis for
understanding has someone may break into

24
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,490
my house

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,359
and you're strapped modeling over the
years we've created a lot of complexity

26
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,869
in the way in which people

27
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,060
instruct you to sprout model when you
think about software

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,749
sick a lot of that complexity takes away
from are indeed ability to do these

29
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:43,119
sorts of tasks

30
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,649
and to apply this sort of thing getting
and so

31
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,679
I like to think about a simple approach
to trap model line

32
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:54,340
and this simple approach boils down to
four questions

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,549
the first question is what are you
building

34
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:00,619
the second is walking the wrong

35
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,739
the third what are you gonna do about it
and then finally did you do a good job

36
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:06,200
numbers 123

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,890
this is really simple it's all things
there

38
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,830
everyone involved in a software project

39
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,080
in a system's rollout or in any other
believe technology

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,110
should be able to answer you can say

41
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,020
we're building this you go to a
whiteboard you draw a picture

42
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,500
you try picture napkin that's the start
of the water you build in question

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,530
the question of what can go wrong we all
have and should have

44
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,060
answers cheese that sort of question we
know that things are gonna go far wrong

45
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,959
with the software that we bills

46
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,080
in the interesting question

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,380
to me is how can we get systematic

48
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,420
about thinking about what can go wrong
how can we go from

49
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,880
intuition to some sort of structure

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,049
so than win youth rat model in use at
modeling use rat model

51
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:03,519
we come up with a reasonably similar
answers so the house

52
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,280
we can say you know we did a good job or
we didn't do a good job because

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,209
everyone's intuition might be different

54
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,980
and that's why we look to frameworks and
so before I go to questions

55
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,380
3&4 wanna share with your framework

56
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,290
than I find Chi be very useful

57
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,930
and that is strong I'd strident stands
for Speed contemporary repudiation

58
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,190
information disclosure denial serves an
elevation of privilege

59
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,500
now that you know that we're ready to
move on and rice no

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,220
let's let's go through that a little bit
more slowly arm

61
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,640
spoofing tampering repudiation
information disclosure denial service

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,340
an elevation a privilege these are
threats or attacks that worker

63
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,370
over and all over again in all sorts of
software projects

64
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,530
box software web services web sites

65
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,720
arm mobile app's all of these suffer
from these sorts of problems

66
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,319
in to help you remember zzzz I have a
few examples

67
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,350
from Star Wars so spoofing

68
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,190
is anything from look sky Walker
pretending to be a stormtrooper

69
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,019
through someone pretending to be pay pal
dot com

70
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,000
or a Nigerian prince with money to give
you

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,320
spoofing might be here's a copy is NT
DLL

72
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,190
which isn't really fast there's all
forms of spoofing attacks which involve

73
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,539
confusing mean

74
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,930
were impersonating one party to another

75
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,930
so the essence tried stands for spoofing
the T in stride stands for tampering

76
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,080
and whether that's been to know be
turning off the power

77
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,810
the power to a tractor beam or somebody
modifying packets on desk

78
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,620
or excuse me packets on the wire orbits
on test

79
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,590
each of these it is an example of
modifying something that you shouldn't

80
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,780
be modifying

81
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,780
so the T in stride stands for tampering
the are in stride stands for repudiation

82
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,169
and that might be Han Solo declaring
that there's been a reactor meltdown

83
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,570
very dangerous cuz he doesn't want the
conversation to continue

84
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,470
it might be sayin I have no idea who
ordered them out

85
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,220
it might be saying I'm sorry I didn't
get your email must've been eaten by a

86
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,310
spam filter

87
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,270
whether it's true or not each of these
is an example

88
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:35,060
over repudiation of some action which
might or might not have taken place

89
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,240
so the are in stride stands for
repudiation

90
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,870
the I in stride stands for information
disclosure

91
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,860
and whether what's been disclosed to the
plans for a battle station

92
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,180
on confidential information about us

93
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,190
on your stock performance or meta-data

94
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,060
information disclosures all about
information that's not

95
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,520
authorized to be out there in some way
now if you're paying attention and

96
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,380
I know it's early in the morning but if
you're paying attention you might notice

97
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,650
that I don't have a LEGO version of this

98
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,580
in the reason for that

99
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,090
on is because a lot of people

100
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,289
petrol let me ask a question here a lot
of people think Star Wars

101
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,219
is about looks journey into manhood
anyone believe Star Wars is

102
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,289
outlook string into manhood yeah

103
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,340
thank you we got at least a couple on
how bout looks relationship to his

104
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,020
father

105
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,069
okay we've got a few more and I'm

106
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,129
I'm sorry but you're wrong Star Wars

107
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:37,219
is the story and information disclosure
through the

108
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:41,039
very opening scenes where we see Prince
a slave ship

109
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,139
being preceded through to the climactic
battle at the

110
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:50,479
and Star Wars is all about information
disclosure and its consequences

111
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,280
I urge you to go we watch the movie in
that light I think you'll enjoy it a lot

112
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,379
so the high in stride stands for
information disclosure

113
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,710
the D in stride stands for denial of
service

114
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,969
and whether that's freezing Han Solo in
carbonite whether it's

115
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,370
sending millions packets to a server so
that the legitimate ones can't get

116
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,009
through whether that's a zip

117
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,539
bomb filling up the hard drive all of
these are about

118
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:23,430
destroying access to some resource or
limiting access to some resource

119
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,520
so the D in stride denial of service

120
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,889
elevation of privilege whether that's
been to know be saying these aren't the

121
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,610
droids you're looking for

122
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,319
someone finding a hit in the head admin
interface

123
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,870
or perhaps other no sending few bash
commands to your web server

124
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,310
each of these is an example other
elevation of privilege

125
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,659
doing things that you're not authorized
to do

126
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:51,249
and so strong I did and

127
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:56,269
acts is a framework a monarch for
helping people

128
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,759
think about the question of what can go
wrong

129
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,249
in the system that we're building or the
system that we're deploying

130
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:08,959
cell questions 3&4 what are you gonna do
about it in did you do could charm

131
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,069
Franklin I don't have great Star Wars
examples from those

132
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:17,729
arm what are you gonna do about it the
right thing to do is file box

133
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,879
track what it is you learned and go deal
with it in the same way you deal with

134
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,269
any

135
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:26,110
other issue in the system's your
building and

136
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,549
did you do good charm do some Q a look
through what you've done

137
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:36,000
but rather than focus on those I wanna
actually share with you tell lessons

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
that I've learned

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,009
along the way is

140
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:44,009
as a strat modeled and more importantly

141
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:47,889
as I've worked with organizations that
have trying to trap model

142
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,990
not succeeded and the reason I wanna
shares ease

143
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,329
is not to point a finger and laugh at
those organizations

144
00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:00,019
but because the mistakes that I've seen
over the years fit into categories they

145
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,529
fit it and she repeated patterns

146
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:05,779
or as it were traps

147
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:10,029
and adlai to explain to you each of
those straps

148
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:14,420
how you can discover that you or an
organization that you're helping is

149
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,509
in one of those traps and help you get
out is it so that you can trap model

150
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:19,759
effectively

151
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,009
so the first rap

152
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:26,259
is something that we as security people
are shocked to say

153
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:29,790
I've said this for years its think like
an attacker

154
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,339
in the trouble was sayin think like an
attacker

155
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,399
is a lot of people have no idea how did

156
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,819
to US but they're embarrassed to admit
that when you say it as if it's an

157
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:45,660
obvious thing so I like to say things
like a professional chef

158
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,029
because even if you love cooking it even
if you're an enthusiastic home shaft

159
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,279
if I ask you to plan a menu for
restaurant with 50 seats

160
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,730
asked you how much do you should buy to
minimize waste and maximize your profit

161
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,689
you'd probably have no idea how to go
about answering those questions

162
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:09,399
a professional chef nose had a jewish if
I walk you through what you could

163
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,889
probably learn

164
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:15,279
but most people need structure and the
question the

165
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,879
exportation to think like a preferred
think like an attacker excuse me

166
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:25,370
doesn't help you understand what you
need to do you in less you already know

167
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,240
and so thinking like an attacker can be
a trap

168
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,439
the second trap

169
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:38,399
is to say you're never done threat
modeling and diagrams like this which

170
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,819
I I'm responsible for this being a lot
of Microsoft

171
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:46,480
modeling documentation are my friend and
he check with likes to call this a

172
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,120
hamster wheel of pain

173
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,600
because you get on to lose in the new go
around and around and around and you

174
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,240
don't get somewhere useful

175
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,170
and the reason that this is really a
trap

176
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,019
is let me be optimistic and say I go to
your VP of development

177
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,920
your VP of Operations and say for this
project that you're dealing

178
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,189
I would like you to add threat modeling
Chi the process

179
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:12,459
be optimistic and she'll see great

180
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,860
I'm happy to G's Nash and then try ask

181
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,470
how long will it take say you never done
threat modeling

182
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,290
she'll say great the doors over there

183
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,430
the problem is if you never done

184
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:33,079
it doesn't fit into a project schedule
insult rather than thinking about this

185
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:33,740
and

186
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,540
is approx the hamster wheel I like to on
rules this loop

187
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,080
in think about it as a linear process
and these four questions are these four

188
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,320
stages model what you build in

189
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,590
arm identify threats what can go wrong

190
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,170
arm mitigate what you gonna do about it

191
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,130
and then validate did you do a good job
this the same four questions

192
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,940
but thinking about it is a linear set of
steps rather than

193
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,800
you're never done helps an organization
pick up and execute on these processes

194
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,890
cell the seven trap you're never done
trap modeling

195
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,180
the third trap is to say

196
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,040
the way to scrap model years and this is
another trap that I've personally fallen

197
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,900
into

198
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,360
where I get very focused on

199
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,030
the way to scrap model he is
strong-minded with this type of diagram

200
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,710
because I've seen that work for lots and
lots of people

201
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:37,020
Bihar also seen other approaches work
well for people

202
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,040
and so now rather than saying the way to
Strathmore was this is an

203
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,410
a much more focused on what helps people
find the threats that they care about

204
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,780
and also focus on the question of what
helps lots of people

205
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,370
I'm really excited to be here true con
with a set of security professionals

206
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:01,250
bar you're not always the people who are
building software

207
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,980
I'm really focus these days on how do I
help the people who are building

208
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,970
software

209
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,860
for building new systems were deploying
those systems think about their strats

210
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,270
because they make decisions without us
in the Rome

211
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,350
and

212
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,560
and if we don't give them ways that they
can make decisions

213
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,880
we don't give them ways that they can
understand what's going in the wrong

214
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,540
then they're gonna make decisions
without that security knowledge

215
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,900
and then we're going to come in and say
oh my gosh you made this big mistake we

216
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,230
have a big problem

217
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,890
and arts are unfortunately we're gonna
do towards the end of their project it's

218
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,960
going to lead

219
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,520
to a lot of conflict that we can avoid
surrounded in sayin

220
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,730
the way to scrap model its I want to
borrow a line from the Pearl folks

221
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,020
and say there's more than one way to
jewish

222
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,370
and because there's more than one way to
do with us

223
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,740
I no longer think about this in terms of
monolithic processes

224
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,440
you might have thought that the lead
those earlier we're just a fun little

225
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,290
thing

226
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,630
and they were but also I think about
threat modeling

227
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:13,170
as a collection of building blocks a set
of things which we can snap together

228
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,800
and we can actually construct different
ways to track model

229
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,770
out of composable pieces in if we go
from a monolithic approach

230
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,940
to a composable approach that it gives
us a couple other advantages one

231
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,980
we can experiment more easily she we can
adapt more

232
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,550
easily so we might use data flow
diagrams as a way to model

233
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,540
and data flow diagrams consistent
processes data flows data stores

234
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,960
in there what's used in a lot of threat
modeling work because dire

235
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,240
David because threats excuse me threats
tend to follow the data flows

236
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,660
so data flow diagrams are great but if
you're strapped modeling and networking

237
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,350
system

238
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,950
you might want to use swim lanes those
long time grams which show packets

239
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,290
moving back and forth

240
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,450
between systems when you're identifying
threats

241
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,660
strident screech for many people in all
talk about

242
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,630
for whom it works but there's other
systems there's a library of threats for

243
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,490
mitre

244
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,590
called keep the common attack pattern

245
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,819
enumeration in categorization aren't you
can use attack trees

246
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:27,449
each of these compds lot Ian with
different types of diagrams

247
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:30,749
you can print model for privacy is while
you can

248
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:34,339
substitute in something like in textual
integrity

249
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:39,359
instead of stride contextual integrity
is a system that says most privacy

250
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,279
violations

251
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,299
have been when the content the
expectations in a context are violated

252
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,109
in a context they barred from sociology

253
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:52,669
where for example going to your doctor's
offices one context speaking at a

254
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:54,209
conference is another

255
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:58,839
being in a car they're just different
expectations and norms behavior each of

256
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:02,479
these if I go to my doctor in sick he
doctor have this rash

257
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:06,549
and my doctor says oh well that's
interesting asked me some questions and

258
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,339
then goes in the other room makes a
phone call to another doctor for some

259
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:10,139
advice

260
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,429
that's perfectly normal in the doctor's
office

261
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:16,660
if I run into my doctor at the
supermarket she said

262
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,350
hey Adam was telling me about this ranch
she has what do you think that would be

263
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,289
weird

264
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:26,160
seen people same conversation

265
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,999
different context and settle the

266
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:33,129
the approaches that contextual integrity
offers

267
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:37,229
allow you to track model for privacy
similarly

268
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:42,069
dance so long in his book understanding
privacy puts forth a categorization of

269
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,459
privacy harms

270
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:47,829
you can use the Han was a data flow
diagram with another diagram

271
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:52,559
to find privacy threats similarly
there's different ways you can address

272
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,159
threats there's different ways you can
validate and so you don't have to think

273
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,079
of these things

274
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,619
is monolithic you can think of them is

275
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:05,220
things that may well composed together
not everything will compose but a lot of

276
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,049
truck model in parts well

277
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:12,629
so i've alluded to this a little bit and

278
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,419
bud

279
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:18,639
different approaches to threat modeling
work for different people

280
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:23,740
for example for many %uh view you can
sit there and use stride

281
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,120
as a way to go through what's going to
go wrong

282
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,889
but if your database expert if your
networking expert you might not have

283
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:34,289
examples of information disclosure

284
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:38,059
hands you might find yourself wanting

285
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:42,340
a more precise more drawn out sort of
approach

286
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,480
Cape ap handles detailed descriptions

287
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,879
I'll different types of threats so for
example will tell you that sequel

288
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:51,750
injection

289
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,649
tends to occur with databases and
database Scranton's

290
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:58,720
this is had test for it this is how to
correct yes

291
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,789
and it's a very organized systematic
approach

292
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:06,509
that meaning no disrespect to the folks
who created his

293
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:10,659
many have you might find a little
tedious to go through

294
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:14,769
in the reason you'll find it tedious as
you know a lot of the information that's

295
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,120
included within its

296
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,450
but if you're expert in something other
than security

297
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,190
keep it can be a real value and for
those

298
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,750
people because it provides the knowledge
that you've absorbed through conferences

299
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,789
like this

300
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:32,049
attack trees something somewhere in the
middle

301
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:36,470
they're useful creating attack trees can
be very hard but using them can be a

302
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,840
little

303
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,590
easier there's one other thing that
often comes up when we're talking about

304
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,450
lists threats are organizing threats

305
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,009
and that is checklists people say can I
just have a checklist

306
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:53,529
everything that might go wrong for my
application and the answer is

307
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:58,149
if your application isn't doing anything
new then yes we can give you a check

308
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:00,370
list with everything that might go wrong
with it

309
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,539
but you're writing nuke food to do new
things you're composing pieces

310
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:11,269
in new ways to do new things and that
probably means there are new threats

311
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:14,440
now I used to really heat shock lists

312
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,210
I completely

313
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,730
and then I read this wonderful little
book called a checklist manifesto

314
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,880
by a true local want and if you hate
checklists

315
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,990
you should take a look at this book it's
an easy read taking an afternoon

316
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,830
and what I learned is that checklist
apply in certain situations which is

317
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,680
when there's a common set of things that
go wrong

318
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,470
that's limited in skill maybe five or
seven items

319
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:44,010
each can be judged quickly a checklist
can be a great thing to use to help you

320
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,970
make sure you're not making a mistake so
for example your landing a plane

321
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,190
is the landing gear down or the flaps in
the right position have you contacted

322
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,130
the tower

323
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,600
you're good to go that doesn't tell you
how to fly a plane

324
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,910
it just tells you these are common
things that are going to go

325
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,990
wrong that people skip over and don't
remember so

326
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,970
you can use checklists as part of
throughout Mar morning did I look at

327
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,810
this

328
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,770
to look at this components do I think
about this threat to think about

329
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,610
tampering today I think about
information disclosure

330
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:23,610
but they can't replace crap modeling so

331
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,970
true

332
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,370
number four is to think about strap
modeling as a single skill

333
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,730
do you understand how to scrap model

334
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,090
Thursday different sub skills within the
church

335
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,539
drawing a Creek diagram which really
helps people

336
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:46,360
see what's likely to go over on is a
skill in another itself

337
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,740
he remembering understanding

338
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,940
what spoofing attacks are likely what
tampering attacks are likely

339
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,309
have drawn attack Trey each of these is
a separate skill

340
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,860
and if you think about strap modeling as
a single monoliths

341
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,559
as a single skill set ups then it
becomes very very hard to teach it

342
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,980
becomes very very hard to learn

343
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,330
because there's so much that's wrapped
up in what you're calling one thing

344
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,000
you break it down it makes it more
accessible so there's techniques there's

345
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,470
also

346
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,220
repertoires the knowledge that we
accumulate each

347
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,679
through conferences to conversations
over beer

348
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,460
about what's gone wrong acts as a
repertoire and you can draw on this and

349
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,580
someone can say

350
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,590
well how would someone do this is that
easy to you

351
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,620
well yeah it's easily do this I can take
as a cell

352
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,900
out with SSL spoof I can use Firesheep

353
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,700
to steal your web cookies in you you
acquire this knowledge over to her name

354
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,280
and i think im one of the things which
really distinguishes

355
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,820
experts is not this idea inborn skill

356
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,210
or thinking like an adapter it's the
knowledge that we accumulate the

357
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,039
frameworks that we put it in so we can
come up with the

358
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,010
answers quickly in apparently
intuitively

359
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:14,350
and a lot of experts i no threat model
in ways that I find

360
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,380
don't work for me for example they start
from that

361
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,509
a list if it had occurred

362
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:21,899
nurse and then they come up with all
these great attacks

363
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:26,059
and the trying teach other people

364
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:29,249
and the other people struggle and I

365
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:32,769
what I've come to believe is that
they're using these attacker lists as a

366
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,589
framework as a mental

367
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:41,139
a mental Truls help them remember what's
going to go wrong in a given situation

368
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:45,059
and that the techniques that I is an
expert might use in the techniques that

369
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,570
a beginner might use might be thirty
different

370
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,999
subtract modeling isn't a single skill
it's a combination of skills

371
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:55,519
and

372
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,789
as a combination of skills there's a

373
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:02,239
there's this belief that when people get
good at this that it must have been

374
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:07,269
inborn it's not inborn anymore than
playing the violin is inborn if you hand

375
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:10,369
me a violent this is a mistake you
should not do this

376
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:15,269
but if you were to him me a violin I
can't make music with this

377
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,319
but if i sat down with the violin
teacher and I learned the fingerings I

378
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,079
learned to use the BOA over time I could
make it less painful for the other

379
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,359
people in the Rome

380
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:30,269
arm but what they would do with that
teacher would do would be give me

381
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:33,309
easy tunes to play he wouldn't start me
off

382
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:38,169
was like Barack violin concertos because
there's simply too difficult for someone

383
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:39,279
who's new

384
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,800
in

385
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:47,280
and so we need to give people manageable
problems as they're getting started

386
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,720
and we need to recognize that not
everyone wants to be a virtuoso not

387
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,090
everyone's goal

388
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,890
is to play in the orchestra I have a lot
of friends who are weak and musicians

389
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,910
they enjoy playing with pickup bans they
have fun

390
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,000
bar they have no aspiration

391
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,780
they don't have the time to really
become an expert and that's it okay

392
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,470
saying

393
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,060
I think if we think about strap modeling
is

394
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,430
something which can be too hard we're
different skill levels

395
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,560
in different things are possible that we
get a lot more

396
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,200
out of the people that were working with
we get a lot more however organizations

397
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,070
than if we demand that everyone be a
concert level violinist

398
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,210
in order to participate in security work
cell

399
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,570
trap number five thinking about threat
modeling is something that's born not

400
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,290
touch

401
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,820
cell is Lando Calrissian says

402
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,440
we've got to give them more time trap
number six is the wrong focus

403
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,710
and gonna walk through these

404
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,010
one by one rather than put them all up
on screen

405
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:57,630
because a lot of what I'm going to say
might be a little shocking

406
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,660
or confrontational for some people

407
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,180
and I apologize I don't mean to you to
confront anyone's ideas as much as

408
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,750
examine them the first focus that i
think is wrong

409
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,750
and I think it's wrong because the panel
explain why

410
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,280
is to start from assets and

411
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,580
starting from asset seems so logical
that it's hard to argue with us

412
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,480
if you don't have any assets why would
you be threat modeling if you don't have

413
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,640
anything to bridge capped

414
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:33,080
why go through this exercise grayish
scene seems logical

415
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,960
the the reason that starting from assets
is a trap is twofold

416
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,110
the first is the question of what is an
answer

417
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,380
so you might start out and say well

418
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,910
Armani our reputation and then you go
through and say well where's the money

419
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,850
the money is in the general ledger

420
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,070
and then the money is in every system
that connects to the general lecture

421
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,809
and then the money is in the developer
desktop the constraints the systems that

422
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,790
connect to the

423
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:06,130
general ledger and so you end up with
these disparate things like the general

424
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,780
ledger in the reputation

425
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,170
aimed everything is now sets you make
this list which is very apples and

426
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,530
oranges

427
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,710
and what he is and do with it

428
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,030
word it where do you go you say well how
could someone attack this

429
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,830
then you draw diagramming your system
and each

430
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:31,780
word when do you use that asset list he
is not asset list when you re valuating

431
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,300
threats when you're sayin

432
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,720
does this matter and

433
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,160
so when you start from assets you do
this

434
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,710
exercise that's complicated

435
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,460
thats failure prone that has
definitional issues

436
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,530
you use it much later in the process
whereas when you come to a system and

437
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,280
say this system right here sir general
ledger do we care about people tampering

438
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,760
with a

439
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,080
give would you arm you can use your
assets later without having created a

440
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,450
comprehensive list at the start

441
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,640
cell I don't like starting from assets

442
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,440
as a way to strap model I also liked rat
model went from a list for tampers

443
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,210
and I don't like starting from a list
which hackers

444
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,240
again for two reasons first because

445
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,260
you might get the less strong

446
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,929
you might forget an attacker that's
going to come after you

447
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:33,620
and secondly you might misunderstand
what those attackers are gonna do

448
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,809
for example arm

449
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:38,340
I had the

450
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,890
I had the interesting experience of
having an office me for a while

451
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,419
who worked for the FBI's counter
intelligence division

452
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,700
and I really like her spine novels I
like john lecarre eight novels and stuff

453
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,640
when I fly

454
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,100
it so I have this picture in my head of
how russian spies

455
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,710
operate and turns out that my office
mate Chris new half Russian spies

456
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,090
operate because he used to help catch
them

457
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,409
my model was completely off base

458
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:09,559
and so if you start from a list of
attackers

459
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:13,700
you have you might have the wrong
tempers you might have the wrong attacks

460
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,039
were is you might also say

461
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,190
while attackers can be useful in trap
modeling in the place to let hackers are

462
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,270
useful

463
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,990
is when someone says will no one would
ever do such

464
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,760
and that's when you can without your
list attackers and say well

465
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,090
actually anonymous did that last year

466
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,740
in this way and that's why you should
care about that or you can get

467
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,419
even a little bit more clever when
someone says no one would ever Jesus

468
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,919
when I know what to do you is I like to
say

469
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:49,880
if I can explain to you who would do
that will you agree to fix this issue

470
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,799
in the reason i ask the hot is because
oftentimes people say

471
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,679
no one would ever do that on what they
mean is not known would ever do that

472
00:28:58,679 --> 00:28:59,570
what they mean is

473
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,580
I don't wanna bother fixing this thing
and so we're gonna have an argument that

474
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,960
no one would do that much

475
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,559
and by asking the question will you
agree to six ish

476
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,500
you can end up having a much more
productive conversation

477
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,309
about is this the cost of fixing or is
this really the belief that it's not

478
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:17,480
going to happen

479
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,200
the

480
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,510
another wrong place to focus is thinking
that threat modeling should focus on

481
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,840
finding threats

482
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,899
this is also pretty natural it's called
track modeling

483
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:35,289
why wouldn't focus on finding threats

484
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:38,789
and the answer not talk more about this

485
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:42,350
in in just a second but the answer is
you should focus on fixing these

486
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,960
problems if you just rat model

487
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,960
you create a list that rats you don't do
anything about it

488
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,849
what's the point of the exercise and so

489
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:55,929
its easy it's easy to get trapped their

490
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:59,570
its easy to get trapped in the way the
threat model years

491
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,149
rather than get focused on what's going
to be wrong

492
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:08,249
and what are we going to do about it arm
and I should I should just mention

493
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:11,279
there are people out there is probably
some with you in the room

494
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,059
P start from assets Easter which hackers
and it works for you

495
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:19,090
great don't change maybe experiment

496
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,649
but if it's working for you Who Am I to
tell you that it's the wrong thing

497
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:27,659
there's more than one way to track model
Ange

498
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:33,200
to the extent that it works have that s
traps 7

499
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,789
is a trap that I'm not positive how we
get out love

500
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:40,409
but it's an important rap in one that I
wanna think about

501
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:43,799
over the next few years which is

502
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:48,789
that threat modeling is for specialists
if a developer came into my office and I

503
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:50,960
was interviewing them for a job

504
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,979
and I said Tommy about branch management
inc.'s

505
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,799
or if I was being nice to me about ranch
management subversion

506
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,109
arm and they said well I've heard about
this version control thing in Prince

507
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:06,220
management but it's not for me

508
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,330
I write my coat once and that CS

509
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,759
I'd say thank you very much nice talking
to you

510
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:15,869
and my have a good day because

511
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:19,940
every developer knows how to use version
control

512
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,700
and when I was a sysadmin I used for
Shin controls a way to manage the system

513
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,320
configuration files

514
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,970
arm I would like a threat modeling to be

515
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,989
at that point were every developer every
sysadmin

516
00:31:34,989 --> 00:31:39,609
knows the basics of threat modeling
understands how to ask what can go wrong

517
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:41,440
and what are we gonna do about it

518
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,460
in a comprehensive systematic way

519
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,759
and this is a stretch goal I'm
optimistic that we can get there

520
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,020
through simple finding in through
identifying the trap

521
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,290
apps that we need to consider and by
teaching it in new and

522
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,300
easier to access ways and

523
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,600
if we can make strat model not
accessible I will consider it a huge

524
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,520
victory for security

525
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,160
so trap number 80s

526
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,240
is thinking that strap think if threat
modeling is

527
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,910
in a vacuum and so they're strats that
are easy and I say easy in quotes

528
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,990
for a developer to fix if there's
business launcher

529
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:27,490
ok in your code you can log what the
business logic is deciding NY but once

530
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,060
that code is compiled and ready to
deploy

531
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,240
you can't figure out what the business
logic is doing saws talked about this a

532
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,220
little bit yesterday in sayin

533
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,840
that complex adaptive at harlem's
vehicles

534
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,420
do things that surprise their creators
and designers

535
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,930
and if you don't have the right longs
you can't figure out why it did the

536
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,150
thing that it did

537
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,780
there are other threats that are easy
for

538
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,450
operations people or easy for hardware
developers to work on

539
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,820
ended each point in the supply chain

540
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,120
it's great if we can't think about what
threats were going to address

541
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,500
and communicate those along the chain

542
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,700
and there's some trolls that help you
Jesus I like creating security

543
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,140
operations guides for my software

544
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,830
early the reason I do that it's Chris a
security operations guide

545
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,100
is a model's what we're going to use the
software to June it's a model for what

546
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,230
we're gonna ask a sysadmin to manage

547
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,860
and I can write that guide and I can
bring it to someone and say could you do

548
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,550
this how much would it take

549
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:38,179
to make this a part of your operations
and usually what they say is huh

550
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:41,650
this is funny you need to simplify this
and this and this and this cuz it's just

551
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,770
too much work

552
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,980
you can also use non requirements

553
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,559
as a way to communicate about how your

554
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,960
your Strat models for example Microsoft

555
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,150
has 10 immutable laws have secured a

556
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,669
which are really all about the Strat
model that Microsoft software tends to

557
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:03,410
follow

558
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,809
if someone can run software on your
computer it's not your computer anymore

559
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:12,379
you might agree you might disagree but
that's the Strat model that the software

560
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:13,470
creators

561
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:18,300
handled in by saying that these are the
things that we will and won't do

562
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,730
you can decide whether or not that's the
right model for you

563
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:26,669
so if you think about right modeling non
and is something happens in a vacuum but

564
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:28,520
something happens as a point

565
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,300
in a supply chain you'll do well by fast

566
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,470
so don't cut model a vacuum

567
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:40,260
trap number nine is a laser-like focus
on threats

568
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,899
there's this interplay up attacks
medications and requirements I'm gonna

569
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:45,540
talk about

570
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,800
each the first

571
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,909
is requirement to try of threats so for
example if someone were to say

572
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:59,530
the plans to this battle station must
remain confidential

573
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,570
then you know that information
disclosure strats are important

574
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,480
to that organization and they have to be
dealt with appropriately

575
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,410
you might go from the other side maybe
the Empire employs a bunch of open

576
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,390
source advocates who say was enough

577
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:18,980
eyes all bugs are shallow or maybe they
say was enough eyes all trenches are

578
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,960
shallow I'm not sure what it say

579
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,290
our own Bart that might drive
conversation about what the requirements

580
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:31,310
really are do we need to keep the plans
to this battle station confidential

581
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,780
I don't know what the right answer is

582
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,240
but I do know that you can start
requirements are you can start from

583
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,000
strats

584
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,970
and they play off each other to help you
understand the other

585
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,049
similarly there's an interplay of
threats and medications

586
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:52,140
arm if I have a doors and I'm worried
someone will go through

587
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,240
I can put a lock on it and then I'm done
right

588
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,690
no obviously not I put a lock on it and
then I have to worry that someone's

589
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,079
gonna pick the lock their gonna kick the
door down

590
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,480
arm and so I put an alarm on the door

591
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,329
and then I have to worry that someone's
gonna cut the alarm wire or otherwise

592
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:13,930
tamper with the sensors and from
thinking clearly about the house as a

593
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:14,760
whole

594
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,390
I have to say okay my overly focus on
this one door

595
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,099
when there's about Windows it doesn't
close because it's been stuck for years

596
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,190
and someone just climbed through s

597
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:28,970
it so there's an interplay between
threats and medications much like

598
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,260
there's an interplay between

599
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,530
transom requirements lastly

600
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,910
there's an interplay between medications
and requirements

601
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,950
if I have a strap that I can't mitigate

602
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:45,119
each for example I'm I wanna talk about
defending against my systems

603
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,500
administrators

604
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,440
and say that every activity on some
system requires a two-person rule

605
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,190
where someone takes in action and
someone else approves

606
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,700
it's hugely expensive to develop
software that does that it's hugely

607
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,319
expensive to operate

608
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:06,020
and so I might declare that if your
administrators untrustworthy

609
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,420
your out of walk and once I've done that
I'm

610
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,660
and I've said that I have a non
requirement that I can't mitigate this

611
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,549
so I'm not gonna try then i free up
security effort to focus on

612
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:24,230
other problems a change my requirements
in the nineteen celeb in accordance with

613
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,309
those nuclear

614
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,740
requirements now you might notice over
here

615
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,740
than I have a I have a dotted line from
requirements to medications

616
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,200
and the reason I have a dotted line from
requirements

617
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,200
choose mitigations is cuz when I drew
this little models help clarify things

618
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,369
it was also a metrical except that one
line I couldn't figure out what that

619
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:51,500
line was until I realized that a
requirement

620
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:56,460
to deploy a medication or control
without the presence of any thrash

621
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,490
is an excellent description have many
compliance programs

622
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:06,340
and maybe that's a useful explanation of
why so many people

623
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,359
are so skeptical of compliance programs
no

624
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:13,660
one other thing I want to say about this

625
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,530
is in the since since it snowed in
started

626
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:23,480
she you reveal information about
surveillance activities by governments

627
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,090
it's become super fashionable to say the
threat model has changed

628
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,800
great people heard this the current
models changed

629
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,170
getting a few nonce so with all due
respect I believe that perspective is

630
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:37,869
wrong

631
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:41,590
if your Strat modeling approach did not
tell you

632
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,450
that eavesdropping on unencrypted
network was possible

633
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,830
it was a crappy threat modeling approach
if your threat modeling approach didn't

634
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,050
tell you is that people might try and
exploit your system to understand what

635
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,330
your computers doing

636
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:00,470
it was a bad threat modeling approach
what's changed in the last year

637
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:05,070
you're in a little bit is that we care
about the requirements to defend against

638
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:05,890
those

639
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,210
Kratz so what's changed aren't the
threats

640
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:13,380
it's the requirements that may sound a
little niggling it may sound like I'm

641
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,410
nitpicking

642
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:18,089
the reason I think it's important is
because

643
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,119
if you're focused on the threats
changing you might not realize that the

644
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,510
business requirements having changed

645
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,740
really means that the business
requirements have changed

646
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,440
and we need to go back and understand
what the new requirements look like

647
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,660
so that we can defend against them
properly cell

648
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:42,599
it's another aspect up the way in which
is hax medications and requirements play

649
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:48,510
against each other

650
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,380
the last rap is crap modeling at the
wrong time

651
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,180
you don't want to be like this guy
coming up and saying sir with analyze

652
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,710
their attack pattern and there is a
danger

653
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,119
he had a bad day after the house arm

654
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:07,270
you wanna threat model early well you're

655
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,670
while your Death Star is

656
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,690
in space topper tried to offer whatever
they call it

657
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,329
you want to think about it because maybe
you can put a plate over that thing

658
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:18,589
maybe you can

659
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:22,650
not built ranchers that lead up to your
thermal exhaust ports

660
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,460
on there's lots of ways you might fix
this problem

661
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,430
but you can't do it in the middle other
battle

662
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,869
and see you need to throw out model well
you're conceptualizing your software

663
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:38,150
well you're thinking about what your new
designs are gonna be well you thinking

664
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,089
about what the deployment will look like

665
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:44,230
you need to got model than cell

666
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,619
this yr those are 10 traps

667
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:51,160
that people in organizations fall into

668
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,069
that make it hard to track model and

669
00:40:55,069 --> 00:41:00,300
I've been speaking a little quickly so I
have a few tricky areas and I'm gonna

670
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,319
talk about one of them

671
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,490
and what I want to talk about is

672
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:09,390
human factors straps arm

673
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,589
that people fall into arm

674
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:17,579
in his popular for security people to
say

675
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,609
given a choice between security and
dancing babies

676
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:23,730
people will pick the dancing babies
every time

677
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:28,050
see some %uh view grinning I see some
recognition unfortunately this is

678
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,290
something we often say with contempt

679
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,910
is if people by their computers to be
secure

680
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,910
know them by their computers to stay up
to date with their friends on Facebook

681
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,310
the by the computers to get some job
done they don't buy the computers to

682
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,440
stay secure

683
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,720
in so I believe that we need to use
models have people

684
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,390
to think about the ways people will
predictably behave

685
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:58,869
to help us build more secure systems and
I might use a behaviorist model

686
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:01,890
on the behaviorists power flows

687
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:05,340
that the dog salivating at the ring a
bell

688
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:11,310
people are trained cheat their condition
to apt in certain ways

689
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:16,760
so with fifty times a day some program
pops up a dialog box that says

690
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,570
hey this file might be dangerous you're
going to get into the habit of hitting

691
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:26,760
okay continue very very quickly because
you're being asked to do this thing over

692
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,900
and over again

693
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,349
and you know we can predict that that's
going to happen

694
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:37,080
we can use cognitive science models
another book that I would highly highly

695
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,950
recommend

696
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,170
Daniel Conley means arm Thinking Fast
and Slow

697
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,349
wonderful book about the how the human
brain works

698
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:49,640
arm and in your he talks about this

699
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,359
this for nomming on that he calls what
you see is all there

700
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,990
years that it's very hard when there are
things happening in front to view

701
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:03,300
to think about abstract things are rules
are other things that are not present

702
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,260
and sell if we think about something
like

703
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,470
a security model for the web browser
were held indicators of security that

704
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,990
appear and disappear

705
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,680
or move around on the screen from
version to version

706
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,050
we can project that when they're not
present people won't be thinking about

707
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:22,869
them

708
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:26,119
and they won't think that this is an in
secure connection

709
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,680
so we can use these models people

710
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,550
in our strat modeling approaches and

711
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:37,490
you can and people chew your software
diagrams you can say hey

712
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,750
this system talks to this system in that
system talks to this person

713
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,050
and when it does you can ask what are
you communicating to the person over

714
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:46,570
here

715
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,770
how is the software communicating that
information

716
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:50,910
and

717
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:55,089
what do you expect that person to know
in those ish simple questions they're

718
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:56,990
not complex questions

719
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:01,150
well I recommend Commons book you don't
need to read it to ask either of those

720
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:01,970
things

721
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:06,099
but you often discover one of two things
with those two questions

722
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:10,230
first you're not communicating a central
information

723
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,900
that the person needs to make a decision
that you expect them to make

724
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,079
and when you ask what decision are we
asking of them

725
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:20,700
what we expect them to know you will
realize that

726
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,930
as you try to make it explosive what
you're asking that the information is

727
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,380
simply not present

728
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,470
or the information they need to make
that decision is so complex

729
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,289
that not even the security people I'd
like Lynda wish

730
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:38,579
and at that point you've identified a
problem when you can work on fixing it

731
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:43,089
if you want to get a little more
advanced you can ask what threats exist

732
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:47,609
to perception or understanding are we
showing them information that's reliable

733
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:50,829
or showing the information an attacker
can spoof

734
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:56,270
change there's we is there's ways you
can think about those sorts

735
00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:01,329
up quite attracts in affective
unmanageable ways

736
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:08,329
well you're strapped modeling in new
system so to sum up

737
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,490
anyone contract model and everyone
should

738
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:18,420
the skills the techniques the repertoire
that are involved in Sat modeling

739
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,869
are things that can be learned by

740
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:24,980
anyone who is smart enough to be writing
food

741
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,369
anyone who's smart enough to be
deploying and managing systems

742
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:32,410
can learn these skills can learn how to
do these tasks

743
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:39,410
there's a lot of traps these straps

744
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:43,849
address I call them traps because I've
seen so many places

745
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:48,339
that have fallen into one or more of
them I've talked to so many software

746
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:51,459
development leaders who have experience
these things

747
00:45:51,459 --> 00:45:56,259
and as a result they don't wanna truck
model anymore because they tried it

748
00:45:56,259 --> 00:46:00,319
and it didn't work for them and

749
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,809
those are real experiences they're hard
to overcome

750
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:08,249
when someone has had the experience of
trying something it didn't work

751
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:12,140
you gotta sell them on doing it again
March

752
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,859
threat modeling is really one of the
most effective ways

753
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:22,109
or even the most effective way to drive
security through a product

754
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:26,929
through a service your system if you're
not struck modeling what your building

755
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:30,049
you going to be finding news and

756
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:34,289
interesting security bugs for a very
very long time

757
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:37,679
and so again anyone can throughout model

758
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:40,809
and everyone should in so

759
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:43,809
I'd like to encourage you to remember
the four questions

760
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:47,449
what are you building walking the wrong
what are you gonna do about it

761
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:51,969
did you do a good job I want you to go
out and be proactive

762
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:57,309
fine security bugs early 6 them before
people start to take advantage of them

763
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:02,859
and i'm hopeful optimistic that the
trolls that I've given you here today

764
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:06,669
can help you drive through on modeling
through the organizations that you work

765
00:47:06,669 --> 00:47:09,589
for through the organizations that you
work with

766
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:14,019
so the clothes this quote from George
box

767
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:17,880
all models are wrong and some models are
useful

768
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,499
I would encourage you to focus in on the
useful kind

769
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:24,640
in with their I am happy she questions

770
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:31,640
thank you very much

771
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,619
we've got some with Michael running town
right now

772
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:43,869
is it me or did you just

773
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:48,170
threat model threat modeling listing a
series of threats

774
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,180
and some medications she they'll be to
better for me

775
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:59,180
up no one else

776
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:13,280
when is the right time to the threat mom
it so when is the right time to do

777
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,270
threat modeling

778
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:18,650
arm you never done threat modeling good

779
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,820
no arm so I like just right model

780
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:26,359
early I like to say when when people are
stern could see those

781
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:30,060
this is the software we're gonna build I
like to strut model

782
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,740
until breadth first I like to say
whether the general threats were going

783
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,619
to encounter

784
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:38,810
and then is people are working on some
feature

785
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:44,790
I like to go deep so when you're working
on the authentication system

786
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:48,140
is the time to think through how we're
going to mitigate the

787
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,570
spoofing strats what threats to those

788
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,790
occur and a special unit

789
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:58,089
control world where you might be doing
test driven development

790
00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:01,450
or some other lean methodology

791
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,650
you can work through what else you need
to work

792
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,000
on is your developing that component

793
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,710
and so Preds early depth later

794
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,670
and then at the end to the project as
you're getting married to live for

795
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:20,599
or finish a sprint you say did you
approximately what we wanted to do in

796
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:23,819
the Sprint do we make changes to trust
boundaries now

797
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:29,140
good were were ready to go and that can
be a five minute thing at the end

798
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:33,160
it doesn't have to be a bit complex
thing that you do once

799
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,339
and if you break it down in Chi the
different components skills in the

800
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:38,500
different tasks

801
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,069
it becomes more and more a part of
development or more and more part

802
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:46,319
I've system deployments rather than
discrete

803
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:53,319
when do I Jesus

804
00:49:58,339 --> 00:50:02,700
had a take so the one thing i think is
difficult the fans

805
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,190
on is feedback it's really hard check
your work

806
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,890
because you're throwing shoulder hurts
and you can't we get off to its and

807
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:13,200
sent from with with Rick morning do it
once you think it's right but

808
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,720
is the real feedback into he did a good
job so

809
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,670
let me your thoughts on that you ID card
check is ready modeling so

810
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,500
so those two aspects to that the the
first EU's

811
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,109
the first is quality assurance

812
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,509
I think I've testers as a natural ally

813
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:36,640
to security testing is all about what
can go wrong

814
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,339
and so oftentimes you can train testers
in the something we found a Microsoft is

815
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,960
that our testers make great strat
modelers

816
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,940
it's just another way for them to plan
to find box

817
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,309
and so that's one way is

818
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:56,099
to your testers fine things that your
Strat modeling approach

819
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:00,619
didn't predict if they do then you need
to work on your

820
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:03,769
on your approach the other saying

821
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,670
is the check your work as you're done
you

822
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:11,279
if you created some sort of diagram %uh
this is

823
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:13,920
this is what we think we're going to
build this is where we think the trust

824
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,220
founders are gonna be

825
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:19,660
did you produce the harsh or did you
produce something different so you can

826
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,059
validate that your strut model matches
your real software

827
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:27,660
you can validate that your Strat model
predicted the sort of bugs that you

828
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,220
ended up finding

829
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,369
and here's a place the pen testing can
be super useful if you have black box

830
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:36,869
and testers who come in they find a
buncha bugs that

831
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:41,170
totally just joint reshot model that
probably means you tried modeling

832
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:45,099
activity you need more training had a
fine traits and how to protect them

833
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:48,910
if your Penn testers find a buncha
strats

834
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:53,390
in the areas that you predicted we're
gonna be problematic well

835
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:57,440
why didn't you control for those threats
as your building software

836
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,740
right what but broke down along the way
your truck modeling was good but there

837
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,010
was a disconnect between trap model

838
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,420
ideation and development activity so
where was the couch

839
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:15,420
that helpful

840
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:26,990
yes

841
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,240
do what

842
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:04,240
mmm

843
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:12,079
so so the question that the questions
about avoiding repeating this trend

844
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,000
analysis

845
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,500
and I think the answer there

846
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:23,500
is the answer the way to launch the
maturity of your testing activity

847
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:30,010
and I'm a big fan of the actual test
driven methodologies

848
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,470
where testing is a key parks other how
you'd

849
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:38,680
develop and at some point it's a matter

850
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,299
%uh luv skill development vant

851
00:53:42,299 --> 00:53:47,210
when you the first time you go through
this you're not going to be

852
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:51,500
as natural urs fluid as the 20th time
you go through us

853
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:57,740
and so do you need to repeat

854
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:02,240
is a difficult question without a lot of
detail that's hard to do in a room like

855
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,160
this

856
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,960
bud I'm a big believer

857
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,270
that if you find used crafts you protect
against them

858
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:14,480
you repeat the activity you will develop
the skill

859
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,770
overtime in developing that skill over
time

860
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:23,670
is something that takes that reflection

861
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,700
and so in your question I heard some
disappointment that you might be going

862
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,839
through the ash

863
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:33,660
and I I would caution you its it so it's
natural to be disappointed

864
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:37,200
but it's also part of the learning
process

865
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,010
if if he somehow you know sad a
6-year-old down in their play in

866
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:46,670
Rachmaninoff concerto the first time
they pick up a violin

867
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:50,210
its it is surprising an unusual

868
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:54,279
so treated as natural treated as

869
00:54:54,279 --> 00:54:57,990
open wouldn't do that to the best of our
ability. let's learn a couple of things

870
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:04,990
let's do a bit better next time and
continue to enter age

871
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,700
building threat modeling for
non-specialists

872
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,080
we need an app for that we need an app
for that

873
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,730
on we don't need we might need a nap
what I think we really need

874
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:21,060
is the elevation of privilege game our
home

875
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,270
which I created as a way to introduce
people

876
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,390
it's on it's available as a free
download

877
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:32,720
arm from Microsoft dot com slash
security STL

878
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,810
or something like that are on and it's
designed

879
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,990
it's designed to help people get started

880
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,080
in a non-threatening way that polls
people in

881
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,450
enforces everyone in the room to
purchase space are

882
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:49,950
in the reason it again it's a physical
card game not in and up

883
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:54,880
is because people get focused on what's
in front to them that same lesser-known

884
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,480
arm from Kahneman is if you can look at
your phone you can go on to Twitter

885
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,120
if you've got these big physical cards
in front of you you have to look at the

886
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,770
cards and talk to the people around you
at the table

887
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:10,230
not quite so good if you're on a
distributed development team

888
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:17,230
but there's trade-offs in a lot of
things in life

889
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:27,329
yeah

890
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:31,470
so I wanted to ask a.m. which industry

891
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,880
are which type of companies are mature
enough today

892
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,690
to the trend fun daily to by threat
modeling

893
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,240
as far as a whatever you think

894
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,940
arm I would look at it

895
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:50,480
is slightly different way I would ask

896
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,099
what industries are so far from mature

897
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:57,510
that they shouldn't trying to throw out
model

898
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,829
and I think there's the answer is very I
don't know if

899
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:05,410
anyone who shouldn't tried a threat
model you know was people built more and

900
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,619
more things with your internet
connection

901
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:12,980
you need to start to learn how to do
this you need to make a part

902
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:18,420
%uh your development activity in a way
which is not someone coming in and

903
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,020
saying

904
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:23,010
you must do this its gets started

905
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:28,400
show some value and make it so natural
that the developers want to do it

906
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,619
in the same way that a lot of developers
i work with

907
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:35,329
would not write code without writing
unit tests for Roush

908
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:40,030
I know developers who wouldn't start a
project without threat modeling because

909
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,500
they've seen what happens when they do
that

910
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,760
and so i think that everyone should get
started

911
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,980
it's why I created the game it's why I
wrote the book

912
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:54,299
is because we're at a stage where we
need to be doing this it's non

913
00:57:54,299 --> 00:57:59,430
we're ready to do this its if we don't
do this we're going to continue to have

914
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,579
been trial

915
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:07,179
big trouble so let's get started

916
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:12,099
so that is an ATM machines because we
all know that many companies are going

917
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:12,809
to

918
00:58:12,809 --> 00:58:17,319
avoid security as much as a kind you
know project cycle because the

919
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:21,009
they will see this an obstacle getting
there some

920
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:25,729
sometimes fortunately and transmitting
seems like

921
00:58:25,729 --> 00:58:28,989
something at this very useful vacancy

922
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:32,420
lie to his friend shoes.com tennis
security pairs

923
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,509
I am I don't know today

924
00:58:36,509 --> 00:58:39,900
who is headed to pay to CAF

925
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,369
these I that's a vis in the life cycle
of

926
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:46,890
project so this is

927
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,939
I am asking and you know the coaches

928
00:58:49,939 --> 00:58:53,339
is this hi

929
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:56,549
nurse I'll the life cycle project life
cycle

930
00:58:56,549 --> 00:59:01,440
closest companies say is it something
this coming

931
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,980
it so so for example and a company like
Microsoft

932
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:09,150
it is absolutely bog-standard you

933
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:12,970
use rat model is part of what you're
doing it's also part

934
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:16,230
%uh as much much smaller companies on

935
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:21,120
what before I joined Microsoft I did
consulting work with a number of

936
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,060
companies where

937
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,800
ranging from our to a couple of days and
I think a lot of the question you're

938
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,010
asking relates to return on investment
right it's

939
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,590
how much time does the strap modeling
work to peak

940
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:38,040
how long does it take before it starts
to shelter how are you

941
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:43,760
in with someone who's experienced arm

942
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,500
I've never personally instruct modeling
for more than an

943
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:52,390
hour with some with a new crew before
someone leaves the room to go start

944
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,380
fixing a bug

945
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:59,150
and she that seems to me to be a pretty
manageable

946
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:03,600
demonstration size most development
teams will give you an hour

947
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,600
to explore new idea and said does that
do something

948
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,550
if threat modeling is you're gonna have
to spend a week

949
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:16,660
I love falling into the straps doing
things that you don't understand

950
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:21,080
people am the questions you're asking
our absolutely natural

951
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,600
where no one wants to spend a week doing
something they don't understand they

952
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,790
don't see the value

953
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:31,950
most people he say give me 30 minutes or
an hour and we'll see if it pans out

954
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:35,090
though to be willing to experiment at
that level

955
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,300
into the trap is get is

956
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,630
shoe find something important in that
our

957
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:46,310
the causes them to spend the next hour
that causes them to spend the next hour

958
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,990
and when they're not getting value
anymore stop pullbacks et

959
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:54,580
great we spent four hours we spent four
really good bugs that would be hard to

960
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,200
fix late in the cycle

961
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,530
we saved ourselves all this time that if
a pen tester and found this

962
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:04,700
it was shipped it would slow down our
shipping cycle has we have to figure out

963
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,960
what to do

964
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,349
that's a win and it gives you the
opportunity to build in the next

965
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:11,450
iteration the next sprint

966
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:14,940
the next version so

967
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,950
when when you're asking about hello how
do you convince company it's worthwhile

968
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:24,339
find the important thing quickly and

969
01:01:24,339 --> 01:01:27,960
thence stop or slow down when you feel
that their

970
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,849
you're getting resistance over time
investment don't feel that has to be a

971
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:33,430
week or a month long project

972
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:36,490
thank you you welcome

973
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:40,140
we've had a quite plausible

974
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,540
threats and mitigations and fixing box

975
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,040
what's your take on accepting some risks
because at some point you have to accept

976
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,299
nice because you can't fix everything
your alright place and time

977
01:01:50,299 --> 01:01:57,299
soul mid medication

978
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,940
or what are you gonna do about ish is a
spectrum from

979
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:05,059
accepting rests shiiiii

980
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:08,690
to making architectural changers

981
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:12,710
and I think the big thing I want to say
about accepting risk is be careful about

982
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:15,339
who you're accepting risk for

983
01:02:15,339 --> 01:02:19,690
for example arm we see

984
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:23,900
we see with the credit card industry
there's a lot of shifting riskin shift

985
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,910
risk is a business activity that make
sense

986
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,339
but you should be explicit about us arm

987
01:02:30,339 --> 01:02:34,710
you know what risks do we own what
tourists are we putting on the customer

988
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:38,619
what risks are we asking people to click
a dialog box that's indistinguishable

989
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:39,920
from

990
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,730
we would like to cover our butts so
please click OK to continue

991
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:46,880
arm but yeah

992
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,990
the the eye Dr are

993
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:52,780
accepting risk the risk trade-offs

994
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:57,330
are are something that you have to work
through

995
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:01,100
organizationally in terms of water
crests are acceptable

996
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:06,160
me what risks is the organization
willing to accept what wrist as the

997
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,580
organization not willing to accept

998
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:15,440
on and thats that's a natural purse
after development right all software has

999
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,200
bugs you ship with bugs

1000
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,270
and thats that's an acceptable thing
because you're adding features

1001
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,700
your new version is probably more secure
than your last even if you now know that

1002
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,300
there's more security issues that you're
aware of

1003
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:32,120
so to yet there's a trade-off it's a
legitimate rate of you have to make us

1004
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,870
okay adam

1005
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:37,260
thank you he's been around the block
