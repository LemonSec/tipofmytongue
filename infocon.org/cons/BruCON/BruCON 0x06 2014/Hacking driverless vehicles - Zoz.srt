1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,370
okay for a Nextag I would like two were

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,270
welcomes us who will be talking about ho
to her

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,250
taking trade for divers vehicles so
please get me wrong

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,590
polls thank you

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,349
I can leave this room Flycam addressing
the united nations or something

6
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:31,660
there extremely exciting including that
the representative

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,930
from the country have anonymous see a
over here for the second round with

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,559
vehicles

9
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,950
quick so I think about myself on I have
an academic background in autonomous

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,629
robots

11
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:47,579
other perhaps what invest $9.4 is a
cable TV show

12
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,590
they did he is a Google product like
this where we tried to act together

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,570
thank all demos

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,059
including several that involve the time
vehicles and

15
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:59,769
wanted the other people on the show with
me was Joe Grande AKA kingpin who is

16
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:00,250
here

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,320
and Franco Nero there and we'll be
talking

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,690
tonight after gaining out your afternoon
entertainment

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,360
is more info about how the school
projects but he is a tiny preview about

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,299
some other ones relevant to this talk we
get a homebrew UAV system

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,570
to help protect on God beaches so it
would fly out

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,740
into the ocean and drop your life
preserver he got into trouble

23
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,840
and we learned a lot about unmanned
aerial systems

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,020
doing this you could say it was an and
punitive

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,100
process meant a lot about failure to
them unmanned aerial vehicles

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,119
on we also DA

27
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,860
driverless ground vehicles for one other
more pressing technological challenges

28
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,509
in the ground vehicle space which is
maintaining the American read in

29
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,049
high-efficiency pizza delivery

30
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:48,670
so he is the solution for local

31
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,049
all times pizza delivery sharing routes
in space with pedestrians on the

32
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:52,630
sidewalk

33
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,000
and the long distance method operating
in a Shi'ite automobile network

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,340
this pizza delivery a to Treasure Island
in San Francisco was the first

35
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,159
ever autonomous crossing in the United
States highway bridge in the service of

36
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,680
pizza

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,890
I can be hard to convince even a human
driver to make that trip

38
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,020
of those groom you need like with but
the robot do it on

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,020
more recently I've been involved in a
lot of people competitions

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,140
for a nation and the ADSI condition so
there's a grounded competition

41
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,970
to aerial vehicles to bow competition
summary competition and those I liked

42
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,730
life streamed on the web several them
and you can you can watch them

43
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,330
but the motivation for this talk I
wanted to say quickly

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,920
I am a huge fan of autonomous unmanned
systems

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,500
I think they %uh the future
transportation and many other industries

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,590
and they definitely coming because there
are so many advantages

47
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,540
such as energy efficiency not having to
carry human drive in I'm gonna carry

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,390
support for the human driver like food
and water and bathrooms or have to stop

49
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,660
for acquiring those many things on that
with also time savings

50
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,180
nothing to do with fatigue boredom no
time spent with rest stops

51
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,830
operate a changeup is that kind of thing
and then all the new applications that

52
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,600
are enabled when it wasn't practical

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,530
are economical before to do that with a
human operating system

54
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,350
so not replacing jobs but actually
enabling

55
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,740
new areas and you places that we can go
and

56
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,400
explore so I say

57
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,630
you can stop the robot revolution even
if you wanted it's coming

58
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,570
but like everything else that you meant
that ever made

59
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,870
in history he's gonna be hacked so I
wanna stop talking about it now

60
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,410
as we're kind of on the cuff this
revolution before the systems that too

61
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,180
entrenched

62
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,740
a for us to go back on certain decisions
that are made

63
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,830
chevron's Rincon think I'm an example
the decision in technology that was made

64
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,940
a long time ago that we're still having
to live with on

65
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,460
this health particular element for
Europe at the moment the american

66
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,650
efforts in this in this

67
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,760
face have been getting a lot of the
press but and Europe

68
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,300
the UK has announced on road trials
driverless vehicles in three cities

69
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,250
starting next year and to go along with
that a $10 million pound Research Fund

70
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,310
Sweden

71
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,680
is giving Volvo commission to invade
Gothenburg with a hundred

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,829
driverless vehicles in 2017 that's a few
years of

73
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,290
but surely many other countries in
Europe and not gonna lie get left behind

74
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,490
again. wanna quickly follow suit and
again we know in technology that haste

75
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,639
and playing catch-up often leads to bad
security decisions

76
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,139
on but with all that said

77
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:38,650
what I don't want to do here is spread
fear uncertainty and doubt

78
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,350
far from it on this isn't going to be
some kinda llamaste

79
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,400
anti robot propaganda sir

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,520
a great pleasure for me to come to
Europe and put to Hitler joke on the

81
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
same slide

82
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,620
over not too soon on but def

83
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,720
this is not what this is about on it's
not about stopping the robot revolution

84
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,669
it's not about

85
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,660
interfering with the the deployment have
the system it's about getting it right

86
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,940
on and I really got a sense

87
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,960
I love the how unmanned systems in the
future

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,310
when I got a chance to grab this video
the five gal helicopter

89
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,729
on a little over a year ago at the
unmanned aerial systems competition so

90
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:18,479
this is a

91
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
US military on and got helicopter and
it's going on

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,760
on a mistake of and

93
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,250
and hopper and ask any of life's not
gonna miss Tess and I really got a sense

94
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,240
right at this videos like Wow

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,960
yet lets let the robot drive it's really
good at

96
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,160
right really really stable on

97
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,200
I'm not trying to be with them but my
point is

98
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,210
I'm doing for hackers and hacking

99
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,370
I mean in the old school fans 0
discussion

100
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,350
analysis figuring out how things work
and what's wrong with them

101
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,320
and how to improve on so it's about
getting people excited to contributing

102
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,870
to that

103
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,420
and to the eventual acceptance
driverless vehicles so we can talk about

104
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,460
vulnerabilities

105
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,590
and interference with tribal system but

106
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,290
out love type got tough love for
speaking amazing vulnerabilities

107
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:12,590
this flask out is is very stable as I
mentioned but the operators if you look

108
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,980
closely it's hard to feel that flight
they're hiding

109
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,070
in almost you know seemingly para behind
the stockpot

110
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,930
just in case so that the security
mindset right it's like yeah we made

111
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,950
this robot we know how good is with the
gonna hide behind everything when we

112
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,770
pick it up

113
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,850
so when I talk about exploits and and

114
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,040
countermeasures against robot vehicles
your job as the audience to think about

115
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,250
count account images

116
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,920
and ways that the system can being can
have its robustness increased

117
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,370
that's how we develop corporate systems
the immune system space is really wide

118
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,970
on it doesn't just mean for long robots

119
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,020
just means that there's not a human
driver a pilot on board

120
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,530
you might have %uh of board controller
or supervisor

121
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:02,640
surface above I thought on any on you
may still have plenty of humans on board

122
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,770
the just not piling I have a safety
pilot well you might have a whole lotta

123
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,380
passengers

124
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,970
and as we know

125
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,320
up until now the field has been largely
dominated by the military

126
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,540
military funding and military
applications and as a lotta reasons for

127
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,220
that which a

128
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,470
need to get into now but

129
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,220
assist a significant now this uptake in
the military space has been a real

130
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,690
system

131
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,129
and

132
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:29,120
that seems a little counterintuitive at
first because the Aerial systems can

133
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,080
pull out at Sky

134
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,169
crash easily but there's a lot of things
about the air that makes the point

135
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,620
simpler for example the fact that if low
probability running into something as

136
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,659
long as you still up in

137
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,810
so he's one representative system this
is the Global Hawk

138
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,120
and they've published on

139
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,470
and unclassified on the uptake in terms
of lighthouses

140
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,800
Global Hawk and you can see that it
looks pretty much like an

141
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,419
an exponential curve and the government

142
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,210
especially in the United States is
really interested in pushing this

143
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,610
exponential uptake and other demands as
well so twelve years ago congress

144
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,069
insisted that by next year by 2015
one-third of all

145
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,520
military ground vehicles will be on hand
obviously

146
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,729
its okay for the people giving money to
say whatever the hell they want

147
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,659
on than other technologists and they
can't make it happen and it's not going

148
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:18,620
to happen by 2015 at the wheel with
their

149
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,710
I'm not gonna talk much more about
military vehicles

150
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,210
I because the capabilities classified
largely

151
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,889
on they already have a very keen
interest in

152
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:33,099
resistance to adversarial engagements am
and as a different cost equation with

153
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,490
respect for example the census high
quality sensors

154
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,829
and once that resistant to you some

155
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:41,919
technical talk about and also most us

156
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,470
in the civilian space will never really
encounter one on

157
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,570
and my sweet goal snowed in and have
people have a lot of people out there is

158
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,940
hopefully whenever and 21

159
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,320
on so

160
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,370
for example the military space their
drivers ground vehicles with

161
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,500
threats design in mind this is a kinda

162
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,070
century droid for the army and as you
can see it absolutely covered in various

163
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,450
weapons

164
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,530
and a lot of redundant sensors on

165
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,470
it for the fun kinda funny to me I could
as the prototype if they just have to

166
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,320
get close enough to this the press funny
kill switches that are all over the

167
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,780
robot

168
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,120
that's kinda like putting an unshielded
reactor exit exhaust port on the desktop

169
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,850
you know

170
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,470
if you just gotta hope someone remembers
to remove that from the production

171
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,130
version

172
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,510
but is gonna start showing up not just
military space but kinda not back out to

173
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,880
love the place obviously

174
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,790
transportation friends about that
particular tech company which I don't

175
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,150
wanna

176
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,310
single out that will mention them a
little bit on

177
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,670
oceanography Zhuge some submersibles

178
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,460
and and boats dress through mapping

179
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,050
on they're all the rage now in camera
control you can buy

180
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,790
really kickoff a stabilized camera

181
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,320
camera drying on now from from China
like 2015 up fifteen hundred dollars

182
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,070
fully-loaded

183
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,470
operates out to a kilometer really
really nice

184
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,610
Palin inspection is huge is

185
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,710
hundreds of thousands of kilometres a
Aline that need get inspected and

186
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,670
robots and efficient way to do that cost
logistics and delivery

187
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,740
ok and other things like that here's
another European sample

188
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,310
rolls-royce maritime division just
announced that they think that the

189
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,750
future

190
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,460
cargo shipping is completely on man and
actually making a documentary right now

191
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,710
about civil application the time and
both

192
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,810
because they're kinda the least explored
area unmanned systems

193
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,930
but there's starting to be a really
really big push their on and

194
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,490
that's partly because seventy-five
percent of maritime accidents are caused

195
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,350
by human error

196
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,990
and the major technical challenges going
on man bites

197
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,300
is dealing with hardware failure really
long Boyd

198
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,480
obviously this this hacking and security
concerns but the fact is saudis

199
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,500
missions go for weeks or months and

200
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,790
things break I

201
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,900
but if you talk to this the industry
Abbas eg advocacy group for ethical

202
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,750
obligations

203
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,090
unmanned vehicles these are there to
prioritise precision agriculture

204
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,270
comment combine harvesters

205
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,050
a lot of things that perform agriculture
right now practically robots already

206
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,550
a to you GPS guidance and localization

207
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,330
on and infill driving past for their the
big

208
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,480
to lightfoot ability overall countries
which

209
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,000
which to food production and
transportation which is basically all up

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,810
on and the roadblocks to fill the main
uptake

211
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,300
I use a shared infrastructure sharing
them with me and because we could take

212
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,890
all the

213
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,550
manned vehicles off the roads right now
then we could deploy the stuff

214
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,180
immediately

215
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,370
but having the robot interoperate with
human makes it difficult

216
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,370
hand in hand with that acceptance

217
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:49,440
safety and robustness demonstrations but
also the public perception of it making

218
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,090
sure people

219
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,460
believe at this second robust and of
course privacy as well that's being

220
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,410
com written into the FAA guidelines on
on

221
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,580
unmanned aerial system regulations even
though

222
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,970
FAA United States really has nothing to
do with privacy that people are so

223
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,970
concerned about it that it's being
written in

224
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,440
but 15 robustness a

225
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,540
you know and let my we've got that out
the way the fun stuff to talk about

226
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,820
is failure here's a couple classic
failures

227
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,900
festival in the aerospace this is

228
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,300
the Boeing Oct 23 docs to

229
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,350
there's single surviving one in the
smithsonian

230
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,470
using their own space in DC if you ever
be DC is that the sea

231
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,620
you can go and look at it this was
ultimately supposed to cost $10 million

232
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,270
dollars per year

233
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,400
thanks I units 11 to 20 after they
finished all the development work

234
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,210
but the prototypes obviously a lot more
expensive the first prototype the %ah q3

235
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,770
fail catastrophically on its very first
flight %uh

236
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,960
are at second flight its second pic of
actually

237
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,930
and I i've seen personally my eyes the
video this

238
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,970
I was not able to get a copy to show
with the sadist gonna have to

239
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,540
imagine it let me talk during on but
here

240
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,810
is the takeoff run have the %ah q3 on

241
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,010
priority me this is the

242
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:13,200
a successful take-off run may be the
first flight second flight

243
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,839
imagine that take up front but imagine
it starting to kinda

244
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,100
jump a little bit on the on the runway
as a thought the takeoff

245
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,959
and those of elation getting bigger and
bigger increasing amplitude until

246
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,290
eventually pitches nose up

247
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,360
stole crashes viable millions of dollars
down the drain

248
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,450
so here's the quote

249
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,649
about what happened from the journal and
I'm in systems engineering

250
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,089
I am prophesying oscillations

251
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:45,910
critical time we infernos hi stolen a
crash what the what happened

252
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,130
well what happened was the designs

253
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,899
who modeled the flight control system
and develop that that the takeoff run

254
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:57,640
model that on asphalt runway smooth
surface no seams

255
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,640
the actual takeoff promised on on a
prefabricated concrete

256
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,950
family that had small tiny like
quarter-inch seems

257
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,000
between the concrete play both

258
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,170
small in health from the seams
shockingly

259
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,399
across wheels took off daily input the
national census

260
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,420
that landed amped and over-corrected and

261
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,029
we saw our classic positive feedback
loop leading to a crash

262
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:25,660
catastrophic failure millions of dollars
down so the morrow that story

263
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,050
tomorrow Zach the expectation for the
design is a critical

264
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,899
even a seemingly trivial detail like the
runway composition can be the difference

265
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,140
between success and failure

266
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,130
and exploitation is going to occur

267
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,160
it's likely to happen at those cracks
between the boundaries the people's

268
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,990
expectations

269
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,370
is another failure example this is an
another classic this

270
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,040
is from the top the first up a grand
challenge an autonomous robot race

271
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,620
between

272
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,010
Los Angeles Las Vegas 2004

273
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,950
on this is sandstorm

274
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,510
com which is that vehicle from a
spin-off from Carnegie Mellon University

275
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,279
and it was the favorite to win the first
up a grand challenge

276
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,360
got around seven miles

277
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,640
before it took a turn wrong and ran off
the side ended up in a weird angle

278
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,910
and caught fire

279
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,700
his to you videos sample in action

280
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,130
one lead eventually to the crash for the
the crashes down the bottom com

281
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,420
so what happened sandstone had a huge
teen

282
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,810
working on right that a lot of people
and they had the ability to extensively

283
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,440
map the course beforehand they actually
had people walk

284
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,530
the entire course on once they got the
information from Topher about where was

285
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,000
gonna go

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,610
the map was so good that they could
pretty
