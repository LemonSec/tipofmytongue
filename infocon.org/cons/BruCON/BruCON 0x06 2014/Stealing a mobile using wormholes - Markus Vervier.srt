1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,800
so

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,769
welcome everybody a.m. too much or kill
stealing a mobile identity using world's

3
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:19,070
I'm like this have you short info about
myself

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,619
the I'm working as a security researcher
and penetration test in Germany

5
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:27,750
for a company anti-fur long but kronen
security

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,730
and my main interests are from where
network security mobile networks

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,489
yep by the finding backs and security
design so

8
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:40,950
what it's all about what what we we
sealer today

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,210
I'll as love you many might know that

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,310
already a about our mobile network
authentication works

11
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,770
then pool yeah I will view awful

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,190
in in rebate Spencer for certain vendor
and how to modify it

13
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,460
and how a modified its and yeah

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,019
accessing the SIM cards on the de Sandra
tools

15
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,549
from nonproliferation and

16
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,520
um who the

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,859
thing else that this lights are not
working it

18
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:17,859
XD sorry

19
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,929
seems to be some technical

20
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:27,929
the pictures stock in

21
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,920
its

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,450
and

23
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,820
me K and sorry

24
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,759
so nets

25
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,759
start to slide thinkin

26
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,860
sue

27
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,000
okay so

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,810
short recap now with with pictures think

29
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,650
so tried before but whatever I'm a
security researcher

30
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,830
from Germany working as penetration
tester security company and

31
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,850
you're like to do all kinds of security
stuff so

32
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,400
what we learn is a homo biometric
authentication works just sort of over

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,720
usual we know what's

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,870
the we talk about today than

35
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,160
Dendrobates band and how to react the
same Kurt

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,200
on a and rightful suffer certain vendor

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,340
um and how to use communication channels

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,000
at the mobile phones have to like for
what authentication of the SIM card

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
so and both of you for mobile network
security basically when

40
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,400
you have a contract with the mobile
network provider day work if your SIM

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,980
card

42
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,060
which the you can use for authentication

43
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,380
the same cat has a secret key that the

44
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,489
I'll to the provider hath and by
shellings response

45
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:20,600
and network a with authentic eight you
and

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,400
interesting thing is the user have no
access to the SIM card

47
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,900
are two to to the secrets in the same
cut

48
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,400
because it's a temporary assistant
device soda

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,850
secretly Scott Kay I am and as usually
you don't know it

50
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,910
and so

51
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,410
I'll the baseband

52
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,480
is still yet the part of your phone that
will

53
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,630
take care of to communication with a
mobile network

54
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,900
it's the yeah it's a separate system

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,450
in your phone that s a separate CPU and

56
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,600
it s your redirect access to the same
cut

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,130
and it's also prepare Terry if that's
come from a commercial vendor

58
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,000
there's only one basement that i kno
dats open sources from the hospital come

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,690
garth

60
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,900
but from yet to arrest is

61
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,930
close thrust into you cunts exit so

62
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,510
who up yeah other vendors for bass pence

63
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,010
there are only a few benders the

64
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,700
the biggest one as a so graphic from the
first quarter of 2014 for aftermarket

65
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,289
sales

66
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,300
and the biggest spenders quite calm and
and asphalt

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,370
by media to expect from Mount Vernon
Taylor and the other so

68
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,020
the green ones are arrests air Anthony
of

69
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,020
me getting spread from and

70
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,490
yet what we will focus today is on the
Media Tech platforms

71
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,520
it's the Chinese mender and you

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,870
yep will see because it's very
convenient as we went with the 22

73
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,520
some yet modify and heck it's because
the other basement vendors are taking or

74
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,340
care to like lock lock this system down
for the others

75
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,380
stuff for death it's been some previous
work of I feel if I'm on and others

76
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,580
so

77
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,450
their MTK base spent is based on a
real-time

78
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,229
the nucleolus OS and very interesting
features that

79
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,229
its loaded actually but Android system

80
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,430
even it is separates the

81
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,550
their systems set from operating system
running

82
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,789
it's loaded but address system from

83
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:41,550
fire cussed back

84
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,450
modem modem that emits and

85
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,770
from yeah and

86
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,450
at current budget takes care of debt arm

87
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,840
actually the separation it's just
logical

88
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,910
that the system will tip design was to
different a process but it's more like

89
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,070
literal because for example duran
mystery at

90
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:09,070
which will come in handy later this week
but see so um

91
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,500
howard s that the look

92
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,450
with the basement so I don't don't know
that the basement

93
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,710
and from an Alcatel

94
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,889
One Touch 918 d that's an older phone

95
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,340
to and debate thing has some

96
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,660
vary your interesting dater in its

97
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,309
title

98
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:41,050
so if you just front springs on the
baseband

99
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,139
you see our country for interesting
information so you see it has some

100
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,429
information about version at the
beginning

101
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:51,889
so you can see that its

102
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,819
the the platform you see some other
information about the

103
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,179
your mmm that's murder development stuff
a

104
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:06,309
you see some soft cock fights your and
it has a lot of the parking information

105
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:10,069
it's not these are not the bucks in both
per se but these are

106
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,159
yet from the vendor to have to be on the
backing stuff in there

107
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,649
so that assertions that will print the
string

108
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,259
if something goes wrong and tell you of
the source code fights

109
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,749
very interesting because now you see
what is going on

110
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:27,789
and yet this is basically it's the this
is a

111
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,219
just running street the net but this is
the yeah like a in force from

112
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:32,149
infrastructure

113
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:35,659
yep so all over to be spent

114
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,929
the yeah for lots of lot of different

115
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:42,889
informations a.m. so it's not encrypt it

116
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:49,889
so

117
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,020
Cape wilt see more about that later

118
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,340
product comes handy first term

119
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,039
so you have to pay spent and you have
a.m. get dad applications processor and

120
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,090
Android system

121
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,860
so how tough the basement communicate
with the

122
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,690
rest of the phone there are two main
methods for that

123
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,000
a there's I'll there's to your art

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,509
less it's more like a serial connection
it's used for

125
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,289
AT commands third SAT comment process on
the

126
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:29,419
on the basement and for things like data
connections GPRS

127
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,669
and the more interesting part is the
shared memory

128
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:38,110
its of CrossFit lower it it's very fast
so you can use it to transfer

129
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,310
out your date you can use it for low
level debugging and

130
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,610
me get a call to use that for to control
the firmware

131
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,870
so you can

132
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,450
that the Android system can reset the
the firmware

133
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,290
12 the baseband it can yeah and
exceptions for the baseband

134
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:03,329
and stuff like that okay

135
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:07,589
so as I said before the basement as

136
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,480
like responsible for the mobile network
and find out that the cations or

137
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,390
basement I'll to manage the SIM card

138
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,630
so I the same the basement sense

139
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,760
command APT use the to the center it's a
pity use our

140
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,990
application protocol data units and
their problem

141
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,890
basically the command sent to the SIM
card and

142
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,820
on the other side it will pass the your
stuff like as an ass

143
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,100
your phone book to some could to get
stuff a

144
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,029
to the AP is which is the application
processor were weather and Reuters

145
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:43,209
running so

146
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,300
nominee there's no need to for direct
access to the same court

147
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,779
front by the AP but

148
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,620
from death and I AT command prompt you
can find

149
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,060
on the death pts intent that some number

150
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,920
on the MTK devices and on the order once

151
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,959
the that the here sort of messed up

152
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,400
the permissions the which gives any

153
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,730
the any application and any process

154
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,959
access to these the devices there

155
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,010
so any device can yes then AT commands

156
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,959
any process can attend AT commands it is
the vice to

157
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,310
another interesting feature is there are
certain

158
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,300
AT commands that mmm your allow generics
in excess

159
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,160
this is even specify it its eighty-plus
see them and

160
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,430
you can is that too yet

161
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,699
sent come out as a SIM card and reader
responses and there are two other

162
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:47,120
methods on other Android platforms

163
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,600
learning which used by the into the
implicate you guys for example

164
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,480
among but here today we talk about media
text which is very simple

165
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,810
so what is the

166
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,860
month in text it's basically you send
eighty per season

167
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,020
then you sent the length and then he
sent the hexane coated commands

168
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,730
their response as the syntax

169
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,740
out to lengthen response X and coated
the

170
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,790
yet XD there's the even it advises

171
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,770
in the specifications of the 3gpp to
take care with these commands

172
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,980
because care must be exercised in eighty
per month that allow

173
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,529
a the TE to take and intensity control
over the same empty interface it deep

174
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,220
the season

175
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,920
and

176
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,510
seems like that the developers didn't
listen to that Atlas

177
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,010
also

178
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:54,010
so

179
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,840
to you

180
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,090
have a shot with you

181
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,610
how that works know yet that this my

182
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,820
the performance terminal to

183
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,370
and I'm Senica months is incorrect
actually

184
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,870
the very interesting commands which term
learned

185
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,150
coat and toll authenticate I will effect
that later

186
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,250
to explain what it means and

187
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,860
another interesting thing this means the
commanders not allowed currently

188
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,940
here but but we need to do is

189
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,610
with another call my aunt which from

190
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,420
the this is the word they were 84 and
desist

191
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,880
select the file from the GSM yes GSM

192
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,790
this worked as you can see that the
response

193
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,200
comes back so we try to authentication

194
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,550
again and again that very interesting is
the

195
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,020
phone with constantly ought to look
talking to the SIM card

196
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,290
so it's like currently blocking or
communications

197
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,840
somehow but there's still some sort of
rate condition and obey them come un

198
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,500
proceso

199
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,020
because after some time now because the
response

200
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,340
and actually this response is the yet
the network authentication that you need

201
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:24,340
to

202
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,120
tho

203
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,430
okay first to come out I sent and

204
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,320
this it's basically the learn a BTU
commands

205
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,060
class this one amines

206
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,210
the new at the generic the same quantum
it but a classic amount that dr.

207
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,030
cutie working with then you have the yet
INS

208
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:50,580
this is the command and the command for
internal authenticate

209
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,560
this means the Yahoo run with the
keystore on the

210
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,820
some cuts you do the your the

211
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,040
do some authentication tent response and

212
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,100
just two penetrators next two bites

213
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,200
Arteaga resentment the key reference and
then you have

214
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,800
payload length and the payload a

215
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,040
mmm this payload is the rents that comes
from the mobile network

216
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,370
and the yeah it's basically yet

217
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,510
your challenge so funny thing is nobody
is just 10

218
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,610
rule of bytes long bout whom somehow the
Media Tech

219
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,730
months 11 yep so

220
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,980
what comes back and the response to

221
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,940
comes back these s rest and the KC so if
you know a bit more about the

222
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,550
GSM UMTS and LTE network security you
recognize these are elected at the crib

223
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,250
two keys

224
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,370
a that you need the for

225
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,930
the mobile network authentication and
desist something that the knob

226
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,500
and privileged epic and like your cat
from your phone without any

227
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,870
permissions felt

228
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,500
this is locally but

229
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,540
as a set why not use that them X is
remotely

230
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,899
so I'm what clinton would if we learn

231
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,300
up until now we learnt that the baseband
firmware

232
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,540
communicates with the application
process over different channels

233
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,899
we learnt that we can access the same
cuts on

234
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,110
many Android phones by AT commands
Mediatech

235
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,170
and cheap Chinese fold eighty don't have
two numbers but there will be many

236
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,170
phones out there that are vulnerable

237
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,509
yep what I can do 100,000 through
millionth

238
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:47,519
and that the basement from a slowed from
a file is located on the Android fight

239
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,139
system

240
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:54,680
so what can we do with that yet

241
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,769
let's use that the the simcha promotes

242
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:01,189
from another phone so we can

243
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:05,480
transferred the the same combatants to
make this another phone at another

244
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,110
platform

245
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,449
arm they are so the firm

246
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:14,810
at the lights are missing but a.m. on
the left side to see the

247
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,800
see the same curtains proxy your
applications using that

248
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,430
over the Internet which will

249
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,740
like talk to loan different phones

250
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,790
and the to yep the an able to fulfil to
use that SIM card

251
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,939
this is like the basic concept so

252
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:39,910
for total of the talk go why do they
call it wormhole its

253
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,040
basically I think it's a good analogy
because the wormhole with

254
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,689
you know it from Star Trek or former
other

255
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:51,180
32 movies is basically a I am

256
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,839
a shortcut through space and time at
which will the

257
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,389
which connects like the distant places

258
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:02,509
instantly so you walk like a path likely
like a passageway

259
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:07,230
you walk through it and then you'd can
travel long distance an

260
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,810
and its not

261
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,089
like very sensibilities places i connect
its

262
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,140
so what other one holds

263
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,280
in your phone our goal is to

264
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,630
transfer a PT use to a remote more about
that I'll

265
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,890
the warmer than the phone other other
communication channels besides the

266
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,850
mobile network

267
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,090
and careful not to smart phone earphone
not have blue to the

268
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,660
is a chance that blue to CF to some
carrots which can have two separate data

269
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,520
connections

270
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,980
am yen F wifi awful

271
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,110
at even this even a illegitimate and

272
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,040
the specified way that the to transfer a
PT used to other fruits it's called

273
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,070
Bluetooth and replication protocol but
it

274
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,620
only worked there for Bluetooth first
wrote the census it's not

275
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,420
intended to be used like over the
Internet so

276
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,470
what we want to do is we want to send a
pretty use

277
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,090
from to remote sim card to use it some
good remote

278
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,620
and to cover it over the Internet using
TCP IP for example

279
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,770
so

280
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,920
I what I did it is I developed a little

281
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,900
yeah pets application for the basement
and also from for Android

282
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,340
is caused to settle same I it today I
released it on the

283
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,570
get up and to condone it it's no for
dinner I to I could to

284
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,400
918 d I am which

285
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,810
gap not definite contender to full

286
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,630
basement fire but it contains like a
binary patch because I don't want to run

287
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,370
into any legal troubles by

288
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,860
like the distributing any intellectual
property

289
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,270
from Mediatech so just released a
difference so it implemented the truth

290
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,020
from Kurt

291
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,320
by be approaching the basement for men
pet from the Sun Media Tech

292
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,930
6573 platforms very the

293
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,570
widespread Houston and unwanted it is a

294
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,330
to identify to function that capsule
capsule system cut excess

295
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,570
its a.m. to this income at all

296
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,940
and it changed it to send APT used to
the application process a

297
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,080
today Android and a return response a
pity Abdu

298
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,769
also from 24 so

299
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,860
the other produce a native Android
application and it will process the

300
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,409
deputy you come out that the basement
ascending it will forward them

301
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:42,490
over TCP to remote system or to another
phone

302
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,559
ended with the write a response a BTU

303
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,649
back to the basement so basically
simulating this to sim card on the

304
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:50,269
basement

305
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,460
it's that short overview

306
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,080
unit can see the lines but on the left
you have to them server

307
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,399
which has to rate some cut somewhere and

308
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:05,670
over TCP it is therefore avoiding the

309
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,890
the responses that the basement sense
it's the

310
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,230
today Android process and then a process
is talking for shared-memory

311
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,010
to the basement so

312
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,160
I but dick to go more into detail

313
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,170
how do we communique from the Android
2.2+

314
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,350
to the basement and the first idea I had
was

315
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,750
to use one of the urethra theory
connections

316
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,170
to like streamed that deputy Youth pin

317
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,970
the to the baseband and yet turned out
to be a bit more

318
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,230
bet idea because and the communication
and

319
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,150
baseband form with and implemented a
synchronously

320
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,700
so you have a lot of handler stuff and

321
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,520
yet would-be a pain to

322
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,360
the yeah the register your own hands
aren't enough to mess with the real-time

323
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,380
operating system so it wasn't not very
easy

324
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,650
so far to bed ok waihee 18 used to share

325
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,270
memory so I that my romance

326
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,550
I PC to mmm the

327
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,000
yep bright the de Peau CLE months to

328
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,630
to the to ship memory in indicate that
with a bit

329
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,990
to to my application which were
monitored a shared-memory

330
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,480
and yet it will be right back

331
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,120
um very helpful was that the source code

332
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,820
of the of some of the media take phones
was published

333
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,140
so we could just see how they do that
with the

334
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:44,400
chat memory and how to how to allocate
and there were some other things that

335
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,080
helped

336
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,170
with the firmware modification because
the

337
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,840
yeah we're 2-2 like this is a new
firmware and assembling the new

338
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,720
new function from and

339
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,350
there at a step before there are a lot
of assertions and the coats

340
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,929
to use the roughly what the code is
doing

341
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,230
am and mmm yet media take

342
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,350
s the their tears other from with other
devices

343
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,570
but they seem to reuse Dakota lot so for
the other device is what it is.

344
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,710
I looked up the relevant functions that
they are using their

345
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,590
with from the other delights in the
search for the opcodes and my firmware

346
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,769
they wanted to to change though and

347
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,570
it made it a lot of easier and across
the firm with no

348
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,980
not obfuscated at all its plane pain arm

349
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,580
from where so the relevant functions
with the same comment all

350
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,369
you can see the yep it's just grab its
use by by

351
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:44,749
nearly everything that this the using
the the more by

352
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:48,259
connection and its the yep

353
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:51,850
its I'll to very busy to to disassemble

354
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,639
so on

355
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:00,749
K shot

356
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:04,080
at the moon video a

357
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,840
room what happens the what happens

358
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,749
unloved so what the what did I do

359
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:16,879
I brought the little pearl script that
will talk to

360
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:20,210
some cart Luton somewhere at the effects
to

361
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,779
and you it will listen on the TCP port

362
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,070
for 711 um

363
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,450
and it will yep a implemented little
protocol that

364
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,679
can transfer to some commands and that
the response

365
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,480
so so what happens when we turn on the
photo

366
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,600
two verses that a petition which are on
the phone and

367
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,379
a.m. Notifo connect via WiFi on the
right to to see that

368
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:52,990
and pool wait a little

369
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,740
and there you have to at the AP you come
out stayed on for what it over

370
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,799
the wifi over TCP to my phone

371
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:03,279
I tried it all to buy sending in them
around the world

372
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,420
and that

373
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,030
really the worked even with the higher
latency

374
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,390
there was no problem so don't know when
it will have no problem with a bit but

375
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,140
of latency

376
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,690
so it's doing all kinds of stuff

377
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,600
in between like winning the phone book
and to in in between

378
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,790
more when it took authentication so by
that time and that my phone was

379
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,160
a.m. already register to the network

380
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,160
and even without them concurred so

381
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,550
yet for the defense what what can you do
with health that

382
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,750
ok and first what what this didn't they

383
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,810
two cases looking what's the you can def

384
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,250
I'm intended them use such select that
take us to youths

385
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,560
your some current pool and

386
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,910
of course this is a multiple you thought
of the same same cuts may be there in

387
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,820
person is registered in the network

388
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,930
maybe not maybe a tour of the network
connection

389
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,260
that's what you can do on Android and

390
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,780
year for like the bad guy if they can
have full maybe they want to be

391
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,040
ever botnet so they can steal the SIM
card for many phone

392
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,410
their are from mo from phone

393
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,540
in their botnet and they can like pair
maybe do

394
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,760
wanted to have a freak or called
somewhere

395
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,460
also you can impersonate a person of
interest at that time like

396
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,700
pool a yep the for network provider

397
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,250
up it's the same with if the SIM card is
in your phone

398
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,160
so defense growth you have to

399
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,900
secure your basement picture in the new
others in some but the

400
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,570
thought about that it's the not as easy
anymore

401
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,590
without privileges without route on the
phone to

402
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:59,160
get to them but its much someplace was
not impossible

403
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,340
I'm of course that's what the providers
are also doing

404
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,020
RightNow because often a pastor at
clients in Kurt's

405
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,600
to try to take multiple uses usages of
the SIM card

406
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,250
yeah and you could maybe to sanity check

407
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,360
a of the physical location so if you're
if your phone

408
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,370
registers in hong kong and five minutes
later it's in Belgium

409
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,800
or Germany or in the US author

410
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:31,240
something smells fishy so

411
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,420
but everything as two sides so

412
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,890
maybe you want to do that you want to
use to think about

413
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,930
and a remote then

414
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,350
term yep it's even harder to defend

415
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,470
so

416
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,880
on the only thing with you have a clue
that that think that has high latency

417
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,390
so you could mid did the responses are
the same

418
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:03,110
because some cart but the return cuts
that the seals to just actively

419
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,790
over the Internet so providers could
maybe try to limit the

420
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,650
response time for death indication
requests but

421
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,830
this I don't know there's zoo of the

422
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,870
devices out there using their mobile
networks so

423
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,910
a maybe there are some there is no one's
maybe you have

424
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,450
Orem packet loss and the radio
connections so

425
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,800
I don't think that this is feasible to
do

426
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,510
to like prevent tease the text so

427
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:37,100
so

428
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,770
at the conclusion but to create chief we
achieved

429
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,279
the we had the suffer a SIM card local

430
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:49,679
which with some cut and an Android phone
we have Android

431
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,270
some excess on the other side also in
the

432
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,460
in in rendered phone but I have to say

433
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,630
I think everette on the on the

434
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:04,750
iPhone 3GS I didn't write but it should
also possibly be on some older iPhones

435
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,929
and we have a wormhole so we have for

436
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:13,289
network connection somewhere or some
communication channel

437
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:16,750
outside up the phone so

438
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,750
this or that and the transfer network a
credentials

439
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,120
so this is due a youth the bad guys the

440
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,279
my it the steel Nexus is some cuts

441
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,320
and used the botnet of

442
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,750
or was 22 of different to

443
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,390
Android phones maybe they open their own
provider to like

444
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,649
selling some cuts are so on but also it
has also good

445
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:44,860
you the your good purpose to

446
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,870
like free to users from some cuts and
also free

447
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,740
from yeah let them share the same
carrots

448
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,279
the to you can the maybe

449
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,809
both something like to or for the mobile
network air

450
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:03,880
like and evading the monitoring by just
rapidly switching the

451
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,190
personas and the moment at work pool

452
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:13,440
so a the main problem is to mobile
network security model is from the 80's

453
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,529
and it's outdated it's not the your

454
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:21,149
fit for a lil smartphones for oil
applications Abbott replication is

455
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:22,169
running on your phone

456
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:26,239
and for some the different communication

457
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:30,330
chance that the your phone hates so

458
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,269
basically also very important and
non-repudiation is gone for good

459
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:38,619
so if you have a sim card in your phone
into I don't know maybe you

460
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:42,559
police suspect you of doing something
bet and

461
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,440
you could say a maybe somebody hacked my
base 10th

462
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,849
and the trans-fats the the credentials

463
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:53,009
my phone yeah that as

464
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:56,309
possibility in so from

465
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:00,419
it's not the not like to strong evidence
that you have a SIM card which is a

466
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,489
hardware device

467
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:05,909
that that is a new phone into you can
change because it's not true we can't

468
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:07,009
just run fair

469
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:11,249
the Texas so

470
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:14,269
infect monitor mobile network that are
heavily monitored

471
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:17,629
today the but amusing that
