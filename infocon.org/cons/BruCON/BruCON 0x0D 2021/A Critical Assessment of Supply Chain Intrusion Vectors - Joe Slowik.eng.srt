1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,399
uh we're going to talk about supply

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,240
chain intrusions today because that has

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,319
been a very popular topic uh for a

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,600
number of reasons in fact i've been

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,760
working on this presentation in a

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,120
accompanying paper which will get

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,080
released very soon for almost two years

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,839
and i kept having to revise the damn

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,119
thing because we would have another

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,520
supply chain intrusion so

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
you know that finally you have to decide

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,840
that like we're done we're just going to

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,000
go with what we have and let future

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,240
events play out as they would be

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
but as far as who am i as far as who am

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,119
i

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
uh my name is joe sloick currently i

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,559
lead the detections development and

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,879
cyber threat intelligence teams at a

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
company called gigamon based in the

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,399
united states

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
previously and you may be more familiar

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,360
with me from prior roles at dragos and

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
domain tools where i was a cyber threat

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,719
researcher with an emphasis on critical

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,320
infrastructure and industrial control

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
systems but then prior to that i

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,920
actually have quite a bit of government

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,840
experience running incident response

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
operations at los alamos national

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,080
laboratory in the united states as well

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,680
as working for the u.s navy which is

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,560
where i

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
uh had my start within the information

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,760
security ecosystem but enough about me

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,240
let's talk about why we're actually here

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,960
so

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,840
we will

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,720
go through a discussion of supply chain

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,640
intrusions and first we'll actually just

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,040
talk about what that means because the

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
idea of a supply chain attack and i

43
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,040
don't like saying attack so much because

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
attack itself is sort of a

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
provocative word i really like to limit

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,479
myself to

47
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,360
attacks as being those items that are

48
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,240
truly disruptive destructive uh

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
disabling sorts of events so we'll

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,960
really talk about intrusions uh broadly

51
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,720
speaking as opposed to attacks which i

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,280
find to be a much more narrow category

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,720
after we have some discussion with

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
examples of what this looks like we'll

55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,799
then talk about how these intrusions are

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,040
actually executed because i think and

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
one of the reasons why i conducted this

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
research and have been uh pretty

59
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,159
interested in this topic for some time

60
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,159
is that there's a lot of misconceptions

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,880
over how easy or how effective a supply

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
chain intrusion can be

63
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,239
with that in mind we'll then talk about

64
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,479
the sorts of difficulties that face an

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
adversary in trying to conduct one of

66
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,239
these attacks and then look into the

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,319
sort of advantages that we

68
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,440
well i think most of us uh as defenders

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,080
have when it comes to trying to detect

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,040
defeat and mitigate a supply chain based

71
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
intrusion

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,640
so to begin

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
the supply chain what does that mean

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,280
what does that consist of and we can

75
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,040
look at a fairly simplistic idea of a

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,720
very well not linear cyclical flow of

77
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
resources from a b to b business to

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,920
business to other business to business

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,480
and on to business to consumer

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,599
flows of resources supplies materials

81
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
equipment etc and that seems well enough

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
except as anyone who works in a modern

83
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,599
enterprise can attest to we're really

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,200
dealing with something that's more like

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,519
this that instead of having a supply

86
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,280
chain we really have something more like

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,360
a supply web and we can see this in the

88
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
context not just in the

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,840
supply chain

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,480
features if you are in a manufacturer or

91
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
even a services company where you have

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,440
servers from some organization an

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,560
operating system from windows or mac or

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,519
apple

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
and all these other devices but then the

96
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,440
plethora of open source projects that

97
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,519
are used within your environments and

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
the other software that is making things

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,599
run the building control systems that

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,760
are cooling the server room all of these

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400
items clustering together to form the

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,480
network of interdependencies and

103
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
relationships that form an organization

104
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
because as part of this

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,760
every one of these links represents a

106
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,319
trust relationship that i have to have

107
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,680
some degree of trust one might even say

108
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
degree of faith which is a scary idea in

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,640
this field uh that these other

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
organizations that i'm dependent upon

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,319
for the successful development and

112
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,640
function of my business

113
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,239
that they have done their jobs that they

114
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
are not compromised by the

115
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,439
ministry of state security or the

116
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,238
national security agency or the gru

117
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,839
but that they have done their work

118
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,079
appropriately and we can actually

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,800
rely on what it is that they've provided

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
now before going any further i want to

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120
emphasize one thing that vulnerabilities

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
in themselves are not supply chain

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,080
attacks um there's been actually quite

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,400
frequent quite recently with the oh my

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,520
god

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,160
can't make these names up can we um

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
vulnerability in microsoft azure that

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
was

129
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,120
broadcast uh incorrectly as a supply

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
chain attack now this could have been a

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
vector to a supply chain intrusion by

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
uh getting into azure instances by

133
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
virtue of the linux agent that was being

134
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
installed on these devices but the

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,440
vulnerability is just a means to

136
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,720
achieving some goal some end and not the

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,440
finalized goal in itself and just

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
identifying a vulnerability in question

139
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,639
doesn't mean that we're really getting

140
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,039
into a supply chain intrusion because

141
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,479
instead we really need to look at a

142
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,479
combination of two factors

143
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,720
first the deliberate modification or

144
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,160
subversion uh subverting trust within

145
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
the supply chain relationship followed

146
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,160
by some way of what of directing that

147
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,880
subversion towards end users because

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
really what i'm looking for is part of a

149
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,479
supply chain intrusion

150
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,639
the entity that i'm compromising

151
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,199
initially isn't my actual target it's

152
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199
rather leveraging the relationships that

153
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,320
entity has with follow-on entities be

154
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,360
they

155
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
services providers manufacturers

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,039
critical infrastructure entities

157
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,800
government agencies

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
as a way of trying to get into those

159
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,280
environments and this could be broken up

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,880
into two fairly distinct mechanisms so

161
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,919
we have

162
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
product type supply chain intrusions but

163
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
we also have services items that i don't

164
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,960
think get talked about as often enough

165
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
that are worth considering so to start

166
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,720
somewhere because we have to pick

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
somewhere let's talk about product based

168
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,680
supply chain intrusions to begin and

169
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
this could break down into hardware and

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,479
devices supply chain intrusions or we

171
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,880
could have items that relate to software

172
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
and code bases and i can

173
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,720
guess that you're already thinking of a

174
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,120
few examples that fit these descriptions

175
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,440
but before we get into specifics what

176
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
does this look like

177
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
theoretically well we start with the

178
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,919
compromise of some vendor or supplier

179
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,479
and then use that access to design or

180
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,280
deliver some capability modifying a bit

181
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,840
of software adding some functionality or

182
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,400
some unintended functionality to a piece

183
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,160
of equipment and then we need to get

184
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
that capability delivered to some

185
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,440
follow-on victim because if i make the

186
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,280
modification to a piece of code that

187
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
inserts a back door that back door is

188
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,960
pointless until it gets into an

189
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,479
environment that i actually want to

190
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,720
access for one reason or another and

191
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
that gives me the opportunity to then do

192
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,520
bad things uh bad things ranging from

193
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,919
anything from uh crypto mining

194
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
ransomware or crypto miners and

195
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,240
ransomware to state-sponsored intrusions

196
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,039
for espionage purposes now in part of

197
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,039
this uh you know it's often quite

198
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,960
emphasized as being a very scary

199
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,800
proposition of having a

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
hardware-based supply chain intrusion

201
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,960
and we have had a few examples of them

202
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
mostly by the americans actually which

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
is uh fun and a little awkward for me

204
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,360
being here but you know we've had items

205
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,919
like the so-called router shop uh

206
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,400
associated with national security agency

207
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,479
operations where allegedly

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,080
entities would

209
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,319
circumvent the delivery of network

210
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,879
appliances before they reach customers

211
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,800
and add functionality to them in route

212
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,240
which when you think about it is a very

213
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,400
elegant way of doing this because as

214
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
we'll see in a few slides here one of

215
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,919
the main problems with the supply chain

216
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,759
intrusion is making sure you're

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,440
inserting that capability in the

218
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,599
environment that you want it to be in

219
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
and if i'm hijacking a truck and

220
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,800
offloading a container and adding a

221
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,479
device that i know is going to get into

222
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,720
a certain organization well i've

223
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,120
really uh

224
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,039
gotten around that problem of

225
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,960
specificity and targeting

226
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,479
and then there's really interesting

227
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,400
items like the crypto ag

228
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,479
incident which was not just a us

229
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,240
operation the germans and others were

230
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,599
involved as well

231
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,000
of subverting cryptographic equipment in

232
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,880
order to make uh crypto

233
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
encrypted communications weaker uh for

234
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
interception and subsequent decryption

235
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
so we do have examples that are out

236
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
there uh ones that don't honestly get

237
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,519
talked about often enough but outside of

238
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,560
that

239
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
we have possible myths

240
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,240
uh there wasn't

241
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,839
you know as one does when leaving

242
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,800
government service in certain countries

243
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,560
an individual who was involved with the

244
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,320
us intelligence agency published a

245
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
memoir when he left service that

246
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
included a story about how the cia

247
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
inserted a logic bomb

248
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,080
into the software for oil and gas

249
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,800
equipment that was stolen

250
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,440
kind of deliberately leaked to the

251
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
russian government

252
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,760
and then

253
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,320
installed into a unnamed facility in

254
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,399
siberia and then after a certain period

255
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,480
of time that device caused an over

256
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
pressurization event to occur and an

257
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,440
explosion

258
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,519
it's a really cool story

259
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,279
sadly there's no proof that it actually

260
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,240
happened

261
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,120
tom rid thomas red formerly of king's

262
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
college london or

263
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,240
anyway formerly of london he's now in

264
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
the u.s

265
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,680
looked into this pretty critically and

266
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,440
really couldn't find any evidence for it

267
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,000
so we have these stories that we come up

268
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,720
with about what supply chain events

269
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,160
especially hardware intrusions might

270
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,480
look like but very very few examples of

271
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
these actually taking place which leads

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,920
to other

273
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,640
very problematic items such well

274
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,440
actually wait a minute

275
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
that skipped a slide

276
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,440
ah so yes i'm sorry

277
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,160
i edited this in a little bit so i'm

278
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,680
getting used to this reformatted

279
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,160
presentation on the software side though

280
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
we do have quite a few examples and

281
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
we've seen many of these pop up over the

282
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,240
last five to ten years and with some

283
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,120
rather frightening uh degrees of uh

284
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,880
expansion so we'll talk about solar

285
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,079
winds in a second don't worry i'm

286
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,399
getting there but you know we had items

287
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,040
like the shadowhammer event which was

288
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
disclosed by researchers from kaspersky

289
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
a few years ago

290
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,640
which was very elegant in how it was

291
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
executed in that a capability was

292
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,120
inserted into the backup view or to the

293
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,760
upgrade utility for asus

294
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,399
motherboards and then through a way of

295
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,160
identifying specific targets through

296
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,320
profiling the machines was only really

297
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
delivered to a few hundred machines out

298
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
of the many thousands that could have

299
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
been opened up to it

300
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
on a more wide scale basis and something

301
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,519
that i think we've forgotten about and

302
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,200
shame on talos for using a very dark

303
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
background on my dark background slide

304
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,160
format

305
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,079
the cc cleaner uh event where

306
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,959
someone had compromised the cc cleaner

307
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,440
tool now owned by avast and avast is now

308
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,839
owned by symantec i think or anyway

309
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,440
ownership has changed

310
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,720
but a widely used tool for it management

311
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
and it system

312
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
administration that had a back door

313
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
inserted into it was never quite clear

314
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
what this was being used for and we

315
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,839
don't really know to this day what the

316
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,160
implications of that intrusion have were

317
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,320
or might have been but a very scary

318
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,160
prospect given how widespread this is

319
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,720
used in environments across the world

320
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,880
but we also have very scary events in

321
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,600
the critical infrastructure sectors so

322
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,160
this uh these items relate to an entity

323
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
called berserk bear energetic bear

324
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
crouching yeti dragonfly

325
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,720
pick your name because we cannot settle

326
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,800
on names in this industry if you're

327
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,560
interested in learning more about this

328
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
specifically i just released a paper and

329
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,399
presentation through the virus bulletin

330
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
conference as of yesterday i've recorded

331
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,160
it in advance so i can come to brew con

332
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,720
because brew con is better i'm sorry

333
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
the events are both quite good um but

334
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,600
anyway to preview what this incident

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,639
involved

336
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,320
the actors in question here did

337
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,639
something very elegant for a industrial

338
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
control system focused supply chain

339
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,720
intrusion rather than get access to

340
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
source code and do a modification for

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
things like network monitoring software

342
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,880
for industrial environments and a couple

343
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,600
of other very very specific very not

344
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
widely used items

345
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,040
instead the adversary did a very

346
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,000
interesting thing and they just

347
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,079
compromised the distribution portal and

348
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,800
took the binary and repackaged the

349
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,040
binaries with a nullsoft installer and

350
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,639
included some extra functionality as

351
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,279
part of the self-extracting archive so

352
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,040
the reason i bring this example up is

353
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,120
that it shows that to do some really

354
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
effective really interesting sort of

355
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,959
software modification supply chain

356
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,959
intrusions i don't need to have access

357
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,959
to the build environment for a given

358
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,200
piece of equipment i can just repackage

359
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
it as a self-extracting zip or nullisoft

360
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
installer and use that in order to

361
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,519
repackage additional functionality with

362
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,480
the

363
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,639
payload to get into the environment so

364
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,320
pretty cool stuff and uh like i said if

365
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,240
you're interested in reading about this

366
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,639
specific example some more i can refer

367
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,000
you to that paper later i didn't have

368
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,040
the link until just yesterday

369
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,320
then we could talk about the most

370
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
successful event and i would throw this

371
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,920
into scare quotes or add a asterisk to

372
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,720
the

373
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,480
end of this sentence because really we

374
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,320
just have the most current

375
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,639
example of a supply chain intrusion and

376
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,360
solar winds sunburst solar

377
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,959
again whatever you'd like to refer to

378
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,000
this as was very elegant because in this

379
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
case the adversary did get access to the

380
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,639
build environment for the solarwinds

381
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,120
orion network monitoring software

382
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
a very interesting piece of software

383
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
since it's going to be connected to or

384
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,639
have permissions to access and

385
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,199
communicate with a variety of devices in

386
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,360
the victim network and then leverage

387
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,440
that access to the build environment to

388
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
actually add the backdoor to the orion

389
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
software at the moment of compilation

390
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,120
that's really wild and pretty damn

391
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
impressive not just because of the fact

392
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
that they were able to do it because but

393
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
because they were able to add that

394
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,959
functionality and not break anything

395
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,519
which we'll get to momentarily because

396
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,360
making these sorts of modifications

397
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,160
while

398
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,839
after the fact when we start reviewing

399
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,480
them like wow this was so complex and so

400
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,240
interesting and uh technically

401
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,320
sophisticated at the same time there are

402
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,160
many routes in which this could go wrong

403
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,199
including making resulting in uh

404
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,519
software that just plain didn't work

405
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,040
resulting in either an ineffectual

406
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,120
capability or a capability that would

407
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
get caught because of the realization

408
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,240
that what's going on with our recent

409
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
orion builds

410
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,480
but we also have

411
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,399
as we are wanting this industry uh

412
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,360
unproven examples and hype uh i'm

413
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,320
guessing

414
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,079
pretty much everyone in this audience is

415
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,079
familiar with the so-called big hack

416
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,800
event that bloomberg reported on a few

417
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
years ago

418
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,279
the media organization since publishing

419
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,480
this has still not recovered their

420
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
reputation in information security

421
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
circles because while this was a

422
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,720
fantastic sort of article in the same

423
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,279
way that unicorns are fantastic animals

424
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,760
um and that it seemed very interesting

425
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,920
and uh very scary well i guess unicorns

426
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
aren't scary depending on your opinion

427
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
on unicorns

428
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,079
but uh

429
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,399
you know in this case allegedly the

430
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,000
chinese intelligence authorities were

431
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,839
inserting a rice-sized chip onto the

432
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,079
motherboards of the company's supermicro

433
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,440
and allowing this to flow into the

434
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,279
supply chain there's actually a lot of

435
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,120
problems with that sort of

436
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,199
methodology because you don't know at

437
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,720
the point of manufacture where that

438
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
motherboard will eventually end up so

439
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
one of the items in terms of targeting

440
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,199
control goes completely out of the

441
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,800
adversary's hands at that point and you

442
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
don't know what your ultimate victims

443
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,880
will be but even despite the actual

444
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,959
theoretical problems behind this type of

445
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,160
intrusion

446
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
no evidence has ever emerged that this

447
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,320
was actually true uh but yet it is still

448
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,880
you know i've talked to cisos and people

449
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,279
in positions of leadership that still

450
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,680
reference this as a concern uh which is

451
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,800
why we need to be careful in

452
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,320
communicating about these sorts of

453
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,959
events because they do influence people

454
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,880
and build up an understanding of the

455
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,440
environment a little more recently and

456
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,079
maybe not as familiar to a european

457
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,959
audience there was a

458
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
controversial event in the united states

459
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,279
revolving a electric transformer that

460
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,839
was built in china and then brought into

461
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,519
the usa

462
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,000
uh there was again no proof ever offered

463
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
that any sort of meaningful modification

464
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,759
to this device took place but it led to

465
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,600
well not legislation but an executive

466
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,160
order by the trump administration

467
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,959
that banned for a period of time all

468
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,720
critical infrastructure devices from

469
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,360
china for a period of time now certainly

470
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
there is a discussion to be had like

471
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
does it make sense for certain countries

472
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,199
to import certain critical technologies

473
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,519
from other places

474
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,199
taken to its logical conclusion that

475
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,720
becomes a very frightening discussion

476
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,079
very quickly

477
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,160
but again in this case a over-hyped

478
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,959
example with no true evidence or no

479
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,720
concrete evidence offered in support of

480
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
it resulted in very meaningful action so

481
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,039
again we need to be careful about what

482
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,119
we're talking about when we refer to

483
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,280
supply chain intrusions because people

484
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
including people in positions of quite

485
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,640
significant power are paying attention

486
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,720
so that's devices and products what

487
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,799
about services you might first ask

488
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,720
yourself what is a services supply chain

489
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,079
intrusion and i think this is something

490
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,840
that often gets lost

491
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,280
so we are going to talk about it because

492
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
i think this is a very powerful

493
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,039
mechanism for

494
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,919
achieving access to victim environments

495
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,320
so one of the earlier examples of how

496
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
this functioned in progress was a

497
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,679
intrusion at u.s retailer target in the

498
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,280
early 2010s

499
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,799
in this case

500
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,520
target the retailer itself was not

501
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,160
initially accessed but rather a

502
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,480
contractor that was responsible for

503
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
building control systems and cooling

504
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,039
systems for the refrigerated cases and

505
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,600
whatnot in the stores was accessed by an

506
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
intruder and that intruder then realized

507
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
that there was a point of connectivity

508
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
between the building management systems

509
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
and the point-of-sale services for the

510
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,200
retailers network

511
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,039
many thousands of lost credit card

512
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,960
numbers later target had a very

513
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,760
embarrassing uh event on their hands now

514
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,240
since that event took place uh the

515
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,200
target corporation has one of the more

516
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
uh

517
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
technically capable security teams in

518
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,080
the usa it's actually quite amazing how

519
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,880
much they invested into that program but

520
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,679
this was after millions of u.s dollars

521
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,480
in fines loss of reputation

522
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,799
and loss of consumer goodwill all as a

523
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,520
result of a relationship with a small

524
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,480
hvac or air conditioning contractor that

525
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,640
was able to be used that

526
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,480
was able to be leveraged to get access

527
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,240
to the environment but there are far

528
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,840
scarier examples although if you're a

529
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,559
retailer this is a very scary example

530
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,400
so we have for example the cloud hopper

531
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,880
campaign associated with depending on

532
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,760
who you ask and how you use these names

533
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,640
an adversary known as apt-10 linked to

534
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
chinese intelligence agencies so pwc did

535
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
an excellent write-up on this campaign

536
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
from a few years ago and in this case

537
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
what the adversaries did were

538
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
compromised a number of managed service

539
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,039
providers about 10 give or take

540
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,640
not all of them have ever been publicly

541
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,320
identified and i'm not here to name and

542
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
shame victims at this point but if you

543
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,960
think about what a managed service

544
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
provider does and the sorts of access

545
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,760
they have to their client networks

546
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,280
having access to a managed service

547
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,440
provider or an msp

548
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
puts an adversary in a very powerful

549
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,200
position of subverting trust within a

550
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
desired environment because you now can

551
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,120
enter into that environment remotely

552
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,919
through the same channels as the msp to

553
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,360
have administrator level access i t

554
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,200
system administrator and system owner

555
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,520
access to a variety of systems and in

556
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
the case of this campaign that resulted

557
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
in rather significant espionage

558
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,960
operations against a variety of

559
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,440
organizations across government defense

560
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,760
industrial base and similar fairly

561
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,120
sensitive sectors so this is no joke

562
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
sort of idea and again gets back to that

563
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,000
idea of subvert identifying and then

564
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
subverting trust relationships between

565
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,919
organizations

566
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,679
and we've also seen this in critical

567
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,000
infrastructure oddly enough again with

568
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,679
berserk bearer

569
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,640
in a campaign that was called

570
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,559
palmetto fusion i don't know what that

571
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,480
means but they called it palmetto fusion

572
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,960
in the us government uh what happened

573
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,120
was the

574
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,919
adversary in question first identified a

575
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,400
number of contractors uh it's like

576
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,039
excavation contractors and electrical

577
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,120
contractors and other organizations that

578
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
were often quite small in one case uh

579
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
one of the initial victims was a

580
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,280
20-person

581
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,120
digging company in

582
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,200
this u.s state of oregon that really

583
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,799
only worked with a couple of clients and

584
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,240
one of them happened to be an energy

585
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,159
utility operating in that part of the

586
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,520
united states

587
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
well from that initial access the

588
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,240
adversary then compromised legitimate

589
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,880
email accounts or created new email

590
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,120
profiles within the victim systems and

591
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
used that to send phishing messages to

592
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,039
the subsequent victims building on the

593
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,880
trust relationship that already existed

594
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
between contractor and customer in order

595
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
to get access into the customer

596
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,520
environments to begin doing activities

597
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
like leaking credentials there was a

598
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,000
really well researched almost scarily

599
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
well researched article in the wall

600
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,559
street journal that details this i think

601
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,919
it is still behind a paywall

602
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,280
unfortunately but went into just the

603
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,400
odd mismatch between again 10 20 person

604
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,679
uh small

605
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,440
enterprises that were the initial

606
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,159
victims to quite large regional energy

607
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,000
utilities as the ultimate victims as a

608
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,919
result of those initial breaches

609
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,039
so okay this all sounds quite scary

610
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,720
but there's questions about this entire

611
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,360
process so yes we can start with

612
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,520
executing a supply chain intrusion and

613
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,400
then we

614
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,880
try to achieve some cyber objectives but

615
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,039
there is this middle area here between

616
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,280
the two that is not often well defined

617
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,679
or well researched in presenting these

618
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,120
sorts of uh

619
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,559
scenarios and that's what we're going to

620
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,320
talk about now

621
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,520
so this is a deliberately complex uh

622
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,880
chart

623
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,760
that uh shows

624
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,840
these sorts of intrusions require lots

625
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,400
of choices lots of decisions and lots of

626
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,840
points of success on the part of an

627
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,720
adversary in order to execute so an

628
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,039
adversary must first identify who the

629
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,640
victims are that are vulnerable to

630
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,320
supply chain relationships what is it

631
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,480
that i'm trying to achieve espionage

632
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,440
missions maybe some sort of monetization

633
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,520
for ransomware or crypto mining or

634
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,320
something along those lines and where is

635
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,559
it that i'm trying to go it may be the

636
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,080
case that i have an adversary that

637
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,559
doesn't care what victims they end up

638
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,400
win with as part of a supply chain

639
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,240
intrusion because maybe they'll just

640
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,159
deploy some again crypto miners or

641
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,240
something but more often than not

642
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,000
especially as we start talking about the

643
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,280
apt related sort of activity they care

644
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
where they end up and need to try to

645
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,440
identify what are the relationships that

646
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
they can take advantage of as part of a

647
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
supply chain intrusion to make this

648
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,000
happen

649
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,679
and then they need to figure out well

650
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,679
okay which entities am i going to

651
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,640
actually

652
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,960
compromise but what that means is that

653
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,280
now i've just doubled the number of

654
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,120
intrusions i need to

655
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,679
uh and be involved in because first

656
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,440
before i even get to my ultimate

657
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,000
intended victim i need to identify and

658
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,039
compromise the supply chain entity

659
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,440
now in some cases like in the palmetto

660
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,600
fusion activity it may be a fairly

661
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,520
trivial target i'm guessing that the 10

662
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,000
to 20 person small enterprise does not

663
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,640
have a very robust cyber security

664
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,200
profile but even still it is a touch

665
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,080
point it is a point of friction where

666
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,840
that adversary could be identified or

667
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,360
potentially mitigated as part of

668
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,159
operations and then from there i need to

669
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,080
figure out how i get from that supply

670
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,960
chain entity to my ultimate victim and

671
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
maintain some degree of control over

672
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,279
whatever capability i've deployed so i

673
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,880
can make it useful

674
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,279
it's one thing to sneak an implant into

675
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,000
an environment but if i can't contact it

676
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,080
or i haven't executed something at the

677
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,320
level of sophistication as a stuxnet

678
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,799
where i can operate fairly autonomously

679
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,200
then i really haven't succeeded in what

680
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,039
it is that i'm trying to do because i've

681
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,440
lost access to whatever capability i've

682
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,720
deployed

683
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,480
and so in looking at this we can almost

684
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,840
map adversary choices and adversary

685
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,159
difficulties onto a

686
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,320
chart so this makes things look overly

687
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,640
scientific perhaps really i'm just

688
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,679
throwing names on axes right here but

689
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,000
you know we can look at a degree of

690
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
control between something that is

691
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,360
completely autonomous versus something

692
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,039
that requires

693
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,600
very manual very interactive control

694
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
like a traditional remote access tool or

695
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,559
a rat

696
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,520
but i also have a targeting continuum i

697
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,760
need to keep in mind between trying to

698
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,799
compromise very specific victims or not

699
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,360
really caring where i distribute a given

700
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,480
capability

701
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
and each of these choices and contains a

702
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,279
degree of risk if i have an autonomous

703
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,679
capability can i maintain control over

704
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,240
it if i have a manual capability that

705
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,159
requires direct interaction then i need

706
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,480
to ensure continuous command and control

707
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,919
in order to make that capability

708
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,960
valuable

709
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,880
similarly from a targeting perspective

710
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,799
if i'm going after specific victims i

711
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,720
can ensure a fairly

712
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,559
controlled profile of where my

713
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,240
intrusions end up and maintain some

714
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,320
security but it also means that i'm not

715
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,039
getting a very broad footprint for the

716
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,960
capability i'm deploying

717
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,400
whereas if i go for a more general

718
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,000
distribution route then yes i'm spraying

719
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,159
that capability across many victims and

720
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,320
so i'm likely to get lucky at least in

721
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,480
some cases but i'm probably going to be

722
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
identified fairly quickly because of

723
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,880
that sort of overreach and we can see

724
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,360
this mapped out to certain campaigns

725
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
so sunburst was

726
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,000
highly autonomous in early stages

727
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,320
through the dns profiling then receiving

728
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,760
the c name and

729
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
other steps as part of that intrusion

730
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,159
chain and as such it was fairly tailored

731
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,799
towards specific victims the result is

732
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,480
though sunburst was not a cheap

733
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,120
capability to develop and deploy so it's

734
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,559
not something that's going to be readily

735
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,720
available to just any adversary

736
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,400
at sort of the other end of the spectrum

737
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,480
in terms of autonomous

738
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,120
execution but more widely distributed we

739
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,840
have not petcha which as we may remember

740
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,760
began as a supply chain intrusion in the

741
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,200
medoc

742
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,600
organization in ukraine then through

743
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,919
continuous credential capture and reuse

744
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,600
and using ms-1710 to sort of show the

745
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,000
middle finger to the americans it spread

746
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,400
quite widely quite quickly resulting in

747
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,960
general distribution autonomous uh

748
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,640
functionality that the adversary really

749
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
couldn't control in an event that likely

750
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,960
spread beyond what it was intended to do

751
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,679
as a capability impacting

752
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,600
mostly just ukraine

753
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,120
but then we also have examples like

754
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,279
dragonfly where

755
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,720
they repackaged the ics software as i

756
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,799
said earlier but did so in a way that

757
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,320
anyone could download it if you go to

758
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,919
the internet archive you can still pull

759
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,240
these files from

760
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,159
cached resources and get your copy of

761
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,880
havocs from the mpconnect software etc

762
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,399
so it's still out there and that really

763
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,320
limits the degree that the adversary can

764
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
manage things like operational security

765
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,600
but once the deployed it's a very manual

766
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
sort of process yes the havoc's back

767
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,520
door gets installed on the system but

768
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,200
it's useless unless the adversary is

769
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,720
actually able to communicate with that

770
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,760
implant and then palmetto fusion

771
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,559
introduced a much more

772
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,159
robust

773
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
victim selection by looking for the

774
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,399
contractor and vendor relationships but

775
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,559
still a very manual control process

776
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,640
because that campaign relied almost

777
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,039
exclusively on capturing credentials and

778
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,320
using them for remote access

779
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,840
capabilities

780
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,520
so what does this mean

781
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,960
this means that adversaries have

782
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,360
constraints and they face choices so

783
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
they can either deploy a capability that

784
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,240
ideally functions completely

785
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,840
independently although that gets very

786
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,080
tricky or they can deploy something that

787
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,600
they can have continuous positive

788
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,520
control over but if they lose that

789
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,360
control link they no longer have a

790
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
useful capability

791
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,520
similarly an adversary can try to

792
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,760
minimize any potential collateral damage

793
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
by making sure that something spreads

794
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,360
only in very narrow very specific

795
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,840
fashion but that limits the amount of

796
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,600
victims or how

797
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,279
well a given capability can be

798
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,520
used or the value they might be able to

799
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
extract from it because

800
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,360
while not all adversaries care about

801
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,279
maintaining a low profile at the same

802
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,960
time no one likes getting caught at the

803
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
end of the day and depending upon the

804
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,520
resources you invested in executing one

805
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,600
of these intrusions it could be quite an

806
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,640
expensive blunder if through overspread

807
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,320
or being very indiscriminate through

808
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
activity that you get identified and

809
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,919
that capability then goes away through

810
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,600
defensive measures

811
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
because in looking at this intruders

812
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
face challenges and i think we lose

813
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
sight of this very often in the public

814
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,000
and especially media

815
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,399
treatment of supply chain intrusions so

816
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,080
from an access perspective i need to

817
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,240
figure out a way to deliver a capability

818
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
to targets but i don't want to spread

819
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,399
too far so i don't get caught

820
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,480
from a communication perspective i want

821
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,960
to try to maintain control over my tools

822
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,039
because again complete autonomous

823
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,279
capabilities as much as you might see

824
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,080
people hyping ai malware and similar

825
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,159
ridiculousness doesn't really exist

826
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,799
right now but at the same time that need

827
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,039
for control provides a detection point

828
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,760
for defenders if you need a c2 channel

829
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
in order to communicate with an implant

830
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,840
i can find you might not be easy but i

831
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,279
can find you

832
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,440
finally from an impact perspective yes

833
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,720
we want to achieve our desired

834
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
objectives whether that be espionage

835
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,840
disruption

836
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,320
or some other adversary value but we

837
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,159
want to try to minimize our unintended

838
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,480
impacts the nutpecia case is a really

839
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,080
valuable example here because like i

840
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,360
said before

841
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,760
not petya based on all available

842
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,080
evidence and the history of sand worm

843
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,039
operations was almost certainly intended

844
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,360
to be focused on ukraine to disable

845
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,159
ukrainian commerce ukrainian transport

846
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,960
etc but because of business links

847
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,799
between ukrainian organizations and

848
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,399
other entities in europe and north

849
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,960
america and asia it resulted in an

850
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,880
infection event that you know resulted

851
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,799
in maersk merck um

852
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,080
mondelez

853
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,240
various other organizations having very

854
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,399
significant disruptions at quite

855
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,200
significant cost and that's a risk in

856
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,960
the case of napeta you could argue that

857
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,640
yes but no one really did anything to

858
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,200
russia as a result well the united

859
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,640
states and the european union and

860
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,279
various entities within the eu

861
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,440
imposed sanctions on russia as a result

862
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,039
we could laugh at that sanctions are not

863
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,720
necessarily the best way of countering

864
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,799
this activity but it still cost their

865
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,120
economy millions of dollars millions of

866
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
euros and lost investment and lost

867
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,519
opportunities so it is it does have some

868
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,480
sort of

869
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,640
impact or risk to it and adversaries

870
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,279
can't completely disregard that maybe in

871
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,399
future those repercussions for a

872
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,320
indiscriminate capability might be more

873
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,679
severe

874
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,240
so looking at this adversaries face a

875
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,559
number of questions that they need to

876
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,600
answer in some satisfactory way and each

877
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,799
of these questions imposes a pain point

878
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,640
or a opportunity for defenders to try to

879
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,000
block mitigate prevent or detect that

880
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,159
sort of adversary activity so how do

881
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,919
they get access to environments and

882
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,360
ensure that they're getting access to

883
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,519
the right ones well if an adversary is

884
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,519
executing some sort of system profiling

885
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,480
utility or

886
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,039
generating very anomalous looking dns

887
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,840
requests to a domain like avsvm cloud

888
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,279
which was what was used in the solar

889
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,120
winds event that becomes a detection

890
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,480
point that i could use in order to

891
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,240
identify that maybe i don't know a

892
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,840
supply chain intrusion is going on

893
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,080
immediately but i can tell it's very odd

894
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,840
for my solarwinds orion server to be

895
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,399
engaging in that sort of traffic

896
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,480
similarly from a control perspective

897
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,240
unless an adversary has succeeded in

898
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,480
developing stuxnet 2.0 or something

899
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,600
similar

900
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,720
they still need some way of

901
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,159
communicating and controlling that

902
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,720
implant and even in the case of stuxnet

903
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,279
that communicated to profootball.com

904
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,519
as a c2 beacon initially to ensure it

905
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,519
was operating in the right geography

906
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,880
still a detection point that was not

907
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,559
taken advantage of by the victims in

908
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,000
that event

909
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,039
finally

910
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,519
as an adversary i may need to figure out

911
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,960
how to

912
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,679
disable remove or mitigate my own

913
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,120
intrusion if i want to maintain a

914
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,799
certain degree of stealth depending upon

915
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,720
where i'm up or operating and that again

916
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,480
gives me an opportunity to catch that

917
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,960
adversary to pull tools off an infected

918
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,440
device and perform some research so all

919
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,880
of these sorts of oh and lastly

920
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,720
except in very rare or very specific

921
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,960
cases the supply chain intrusion is just

922
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,880
an infection route

923
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,200
as such the supply chain intrusion is a

924
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,279
means to gain access to the environment

925
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,200
and actually getting value from that

926
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,000
intrusion requires spreading out from

927
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,640
that initial access point at that stage

928
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,320
all of our classic ways of trying to

929
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,640
identify detect or minimize lateral

930
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,279
movement from identifying code execution

931
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,760
within environments to monitoring remote

932
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,159
access and credential replay

933
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,240
within our networks come into play to

934
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,080
identify that something

935
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,799
bad is going on and we see this in

936
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,279
examples so for example we have the risk

937
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,200
of overspread this is the wannacry

938
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,840
incident and not the uh napetja incident

939
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,320
but still just shows that a capability

940
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
that's not narrowly tailored but can

941
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,399
operate autonomously

942
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,120
spreads out of control quite quickly and

943
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,960
unless i'm an adversary that just simply

944
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,519
wishes to see the world burn i need to

945
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,760
exercise some degree of control or

946
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,080
maintain some degree of positive

947
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,760
interaction with that capability to

948
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,080
avoid worst case scenarios

949
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,559
but there's also the inadvertent loss of

950
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,079
command and control

951
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,599
so

952
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,800
i can

953
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,280
deploy a wonderful capability wonderful

954
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,359
from the adversary's perspective like

955
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,000
the sunburst tool in solarwinds orion

956
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,280
and then my victim decides that oh you

957
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,879
know what we're actually going to switch

958
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,599
our network monitoring uh vendor to a

959
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,599
cisco product or something else

960
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,839
ripping out my precious access from the

961
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,040
environment and replacing it with

962
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,599
something i have no visibility over or i

963
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,839
have a pet i've applied the malicious

964
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,839
patch that the adversary had at one

965
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,679
point in time but then an update has

966
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,679
been issued since then which i apply

967
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,359
that removes the back door

968
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,359
adversaries don't have control over what

969
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,359
victims are doing in their environments

970
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,359
even when a capability has been deployed

971
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,839
so accidents happen and capabilities can

972
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,040
be mitigated neutered or even removed

973
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,200
just through the normal everyday actions

974
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,640
taken within the victims environment

975
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,200
finally i have capabilities that just

976
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,280
might not work this has really been the

977
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,800
case in looking at critical

978
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,040
infrastructure events and items with

979
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,520
industrial control system capabilities

980
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,200
they're not necessarily supply chain

981
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,119
intrusions but just when you start

982
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,560
playing out

983
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
the ability to operate especially for

984
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,520
autonomous capabilities in

985
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,280
very specific sorts of environments the

986
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
risk or the likelihood that things could

987
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,680
just not work or go wrong begin

988
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,920
increasing quite significantly and quite

989
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,040
quickly

990
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,400
so that leads to this comment

991
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,640
how many people have seen this idea

992
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
before yeah exactly the attacker only

993
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,880
has to be successful once the defender

994
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,200
needs to be right every time well

995
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,359
 that is not true

996
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,280
rather we can turn this around that the

997
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,880
adversary through multiple phases of

998
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,920
their intrusion even in a very

999
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,760
complex intrusion especially a very

1000
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,160
complex intrusion such as a supply chain

1001
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,560
event has to be right at multiple phases

1002
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
of the game whereas from the defender's

1003
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,400
perspective as long as we're performing

1004
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,720
sufficient root cause analysis and

1005
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
following leads and evidence where it

1006
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,880
takes us we really need to only be right

1007
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,800
once in order to potentially roll up a

1008
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
very sophisticated very complex sort of

1009
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,920
intrusion scenario because defenders

1010
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,800
have advantages for one we own the damn

1011
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,880
network that we don't take advantage of

1012
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
this often enough is kind of sad and

1013
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,320
certainly it's very difficult you know

1014
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,400
very many networks are flat segmentation

1015
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,839
is not always easy

1016
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,920
but we need to emphasize to our network

1017
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,760
owners to our network administrators and

1018
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,920
to our other stakeholders that this is a

1019
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,839
powerful capability that allows us to

1020
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,400
potentially isolate or limit the sort of

1021
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
risk imposed by even something as

1022
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,440
worrying as a supply chain intrusion

1023
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,960
it also means that

1024
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,560
it's our network we should have some

1025
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,400
understanding of what normal is now

1026
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,880
granted anomaly detection can be a very

1027
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,800
controversial sort of subject and has

1028
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,119
its own sorts of problems but applied

1029
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,040
intelligently with a threat intelligence

1030
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,200
perspective as well as an understanding

1031
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,720
of the sort of deviations you would

1032
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,040
anticipate in your environment can be

1033
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
incredibly helpful to identify again

1034
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,480
instances like

1035
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,359
dns beacons to avsvm cloud that is an

1036
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,760
anomaly that honestly especially

1037
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,560
organizations like

1038
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,119
something that rhymes with an eye

1039
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,240
i really don't want to like name and

1040
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,400
shame people but you would think that

1041
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,160
people would be looking for these sorts

1042
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,640
of events because they do provide strong

1043
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,480
signals that we can use to roll things

1044
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,800
up that gets us into communications

1045
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,880
analysis more generally so i work for a

1046
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,480
network security monitoring company

1047
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
right now so i'm probably a bit biased

1048
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,839
but i do strongly believe in this

1049
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,160
mission that at the end of the day

1050
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
packets or it didn't happen really

1051
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,800
applies quite well to security problems

1052
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,560
generally unless you're facing a

1053
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,400
completely autonomous capability that

1054
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,240
needs no communication with the outside

1055
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
world adversaries have to talk or

1056
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,480
capabilities have to talk out we as

1057
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,960
network owners can look at that traffic

1058
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,400
even if you're not doing something like

1059
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,880
ssl inspection and interception we still

1060
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,800
have the ability to look at netflows

1061
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,839
look at

1062
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,920
transmission versus receipt ratios and

1063
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,079
other items in order to identify things

1064
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,359
that are interesting

1065
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,599
are all of these easy no of course not

1066
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,599
but if we want to defend our networks

1067
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,440
especially against certain

1068
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,760
categories of adversary these are the

1069
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,880
sorts of things that we need to

1070
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,800
recognize exists

1071
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,320
to take advantage of for defender

1072
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,560
purposes and begin using them as often

1073
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,640
and as well as we can

1074
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,520
so

1075
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,040
given that we already retained some

1076
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,440
fundamental defensive advantages

1077
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,520
applying things like good segmentation

1078
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,560
good design internal or east-west style

1079
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,240
visibility for inter-network

1080
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,640
communication start enhancing those

1081
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,800
advantages even further if we start

1082
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,480
doing things like establishing choke

1083
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,079
points and monitoring points whether

1084
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,160
that be from a network perspective by

1085
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,599
having a segmented network and then

1086
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,000
having a sensor deployed before you get

1087
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,079
into the sensitive physically isolated

1088
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,640
lan or establishing things like jump

1089
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,000
boxes or bastion hosts for communication

1090
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,079
into and out of sensitive networks we

1091
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,920
can still start building capabilities

1092
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,400
for identifying when adversaries try to

1093
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,079
begin moving out from an initial point

1094
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,160
of access in order to start gaining

1095
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,480
actual value from an intrusion

1096
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,400
so to see how this looks in practice

1097
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
i'm going to use an industrial control

1098
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,079
system relevant model uh to discuss so

1099
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,119
this is the purdue reference

1100
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,960
architecture which really if you're not

1101
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,480
in ics environment that just means

1102
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,000
you're operating at these three levels

1103
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,480
up here but notionally shows the

1104
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,240
separation between different types of

1105
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,079
networks and different types of

1106
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,079
communication profiles within an

1107
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,800
organization and what we want to do is

1108
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,520
instead of having some sort of

1109
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
you know

1110
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,160
guard the border and guard nothing else

1111
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,240
approach we want to layer defenses

1112
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,480
throughout our entire network profile so

1113
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,599
that yes maybe a adversary is able to

1114
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,320
swim around our network border control

1115
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,000
and monitoring through a supply chain

1116
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
intrusion to deliver something very deep

1117
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,839
within our network but we're still going

1118
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,359
to be able to identify something going

1119
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,280
on quite deep within it because we're

1120
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,680
monitoring for those raw egress routes

1121
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,319
or ingress routes to and from it uh to

1122
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,119
spot any opportunity or any activity

1123
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,800
meant to take advantage of that

1124
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,560
intrusion once it's been

1125
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,760
deployed

1126
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
and certainly we start with the ingress

1127
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,599
and egress visibility so just like i

1128
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,000
talked about a few slides ago monitoring

1129
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,160
traffic capturing items like you know

1130
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,920
just what domains am i seeing and what

1131
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,839
do they look like and how can i start

1132
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,400
differentiating good from bad or good

1133
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,960
from suspicious and using those sorts of

1134
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,200
methodologies to capture potential c2

1135
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,160
traffic

1136
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,640
but then going even further into enclave

1137
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,119
separation and access controls

1138
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,359
inside my networks so it's not just the

1139
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,880
case that everyone is running local

1140
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,480
admin on their machine within the

1141
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,480
network and you can rdp from anywhere to

1142
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,280
anywhere else with no two-factor token

1143
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,119
but really trying to significantly

1144
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,520
impede the ability of an intruder an

1145
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,440
intruder to

1146
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,760
break out of an initial access point in

1147
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,839
order to get greater value from the

1148
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,640
environment that they have broken into

1149
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,400
and finally as i start getting even

1150
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,079
deeper into networks like if you are in

1151
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,920
a critical infrastructure segment or

1152
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,960
even say medical environments you know i

1153
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,560
have critical systems that aren't really

1154
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,480
traditional i.t but more embedded

1155
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,520
systems industrial control systems etc

1156
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,280
well at this stage i need to have

1157
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,640
visibility into these critical

1158
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
environments and many organizations

1159
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,319
don't right now that means process

1160
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,160
monitoring and baselining and other ways

1161
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,319
of trying to identify you know if i have

1162
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,160
a stuxnet in my environment that i'm

1163
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
able to catch when the centrifuges begin

1164
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,480
over pressurizing or overspinning to use

1165
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,400
that example yet again i don't think

1166
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,920
stuxnet's actually been mentioned at all

1167
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,520
in this conference so far so i've broken

1168
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,240
that taboo i apologize

1169
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,680
and finally

1170
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
if we are talking about say a

1171
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,040
manufacturing environment or some other

1172
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,560
area where there is a

1173
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,640
cyber physical nexus to things and so

1174
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,400
now we're getting into not just supply

1175
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,640
chain intrusions but supply chain chain

1176
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,280
attacks where an adversary is trying to

1177
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,960
disrupt disable destroy etc well

1178
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,000
i am not lost at that stage of the game

1179
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,760
even if an adversary has succeeded in

1180
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,520
breaching many other layers of defense

1181
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,760
because i have things like engineering

1182
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,920
controls process monitoring and other

1183
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,720
safeguards that can turn a crisis event

1184
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,040
into an inconvenience

1185
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,520
as long as they are well deployed tested

1186
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,040
and available within the network in

1187
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,480
order to step in

1188
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,319
uh again not a supply chain intrusion

1189
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,160
but emphasizing the importance of this

1190
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,319
sort of controls if you look at the

1191
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,359
triton event from well really 2016 to

1192
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,440
2017 but was publicized in 2018 that was

1193
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
a case where a capability was deployed

1194
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,079
fairly deep into an oil and gas network

1195
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,280
and that capability if properly used

1196
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
they screwed it up so it didn't quite

1197
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,599
work out the way they intended

1198
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,760
may have led to a over pressurization

1199
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,720
event

1200
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
that would have resulted in physical

1201
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,640
damage to the environment well that's

1202
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,560
true but at the same time even though

1203
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,319
the automated safety level was

1204
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,480
compromised there still exists physical

1205
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,000
and engineering safeguards from

1206
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,680
everything like a blowout valve to the

1207
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,200
ability to vent product into the

1208
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
atmosphere which is very bad from an

1209
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,640
environmental standpoint but still

1210
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,920
better off than having an entire

1211
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
facility explode

1212
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,359
these options exist and we need to

1213
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,119
recognize where they do and begin

1214
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,200
understanding how our other controls

1215
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,079
layer across security disciplines not

1216
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,119
just i.t or ics security but physical

1217
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,560
security

1218
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,000
disaster recovery and business

1219
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,920
continuity understanding of how our

1220
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,520
networks actually function in the sorts

1221
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,880
of value that they are designed to

1222
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,319
deliver

1223
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,920
now this certainly requires a number of

1224
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,680
prerequisites again i am not going to

1225
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,520
stand here and pretend that anything

1226
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,599
that i've described is easy it's not

1227
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,760
because it requires time effort and

1228
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,920
resources to apply this but if we're

1229
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,599
going to take these sorts of adversaries

1230
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,160
seriously we need to so-called roll up

1231
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,839
our sleeves and begin engaging in this

1232
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,839
sort of activity that means having

1233
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,000
things as simple as asset identification

1234
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,680
it sounds ridiculous that that is an

1235
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,680
important security control but just

1236
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,839
being able to identify that yes it is my

1237
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,520
solarwinds orion network monitoring

1238
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,359
server that is engaging in dodge of

1239
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,079
communication is a

1240
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,319
significantly improved posture to have

1241
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,400
than like i have just a device in my

1242
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,680
network that's communicating to a

1243
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,920
previously unseen domain that's a very

1244
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,319
unenriched perspective on matters

1245
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,839
whereas having adequate asset

1246
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,400
identification allows me to

1247
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
ask better questions and gain more

1248
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
refined answers of what's going on in my

1249
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,079
network that also means traffic

1250
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,079
visibility and this is a contentious

1251
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,000
topic and i spoke about this at the deep

1252
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,720
sec conference last year uh

1253
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,640
that you know certainly we want

1254
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
encrypted communications over networks

1255
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,200
that we don't control but given

1256
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,280
adversary migration

1257
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,440
from very bespoke or custom command and

1258
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,280
control frameworks just wrapping

1259
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,760
everything in ssl tls we really need to

1260
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,280
have serious conversations about

1261
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,680
breaking ssl internally for the purposes

1262
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,760
of visibility again there is a cost and

1263
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,359
a benefit from this and it may not be

1264
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,520
appropriate for all organizations but it

1265
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
is quest they are questions that need to

1266
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,680
be addressed and considered in order to

1267
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,760
really understand what sort of risk that

1268
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,359
we're offering within our environment

1269
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,520
and how we might try to address it

1270
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,920
that also gets into traffic control do i

1271
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,760
have a flat network or have i segmented

1272
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,280
things off so it's not just a question

1273
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,280
of any host can talk to any other but

1274
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,960
that i have controls mitigations and

1275
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,200
visibility for east-west as well as

1276
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,280
north-south communications

1277
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,599
uh yes getting into segmentation but the

1278
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,160
last thing i want to emphasize uh

1279
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,119
are having trained enabled curious

1280
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,160
personnel because all of these items

1281
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,240
while we can build some automation into

1282
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,920
things and you can get plenty of vendors

1283
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,599
that want to sell you a blinky box to

1284
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,760
throw into the server closet and whatnot

1285
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,640
that do xdr soar whatever you want to

1286
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,359
call

1287
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,119
the latest buzzword

1288
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,640
at the end of the day

1289
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,640
these items get detected solar winds

1290
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,880
gets detected stuxnet gets detected

1291
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,400
because someone asked a question and

1292
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,240
then they went to go answer it and we

1293
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,319
need to try to find and certainly the

1294
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,280
last presentation uh concerning ccb

1295
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,880
emphasize that yeah finding people is

1296
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,040
difficult these days but when we find

1297
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,000
people we want to ensure that they have

1298
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,720
the ability and the freedom to begin

1299
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,400
asking questions and exploring these

1300
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,720
incidents so that the next solar winds

1301
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,480
or the next uh

1302
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,720
shadowhammer uh event

1303
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,240
doesn't get ignored as like oh this is

1304
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,160
just the network being weird but rather

1305
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,760
like huh i wonder why this actually

1306
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,680
happened and where it came from that we

1307
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,119
ask those questions and follow these

1308
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,359
investigations through to a reasonably

1309
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,040
logical end

1310
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,480
so to conclude

1311
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,400
adversaries are increasingly interested

1312
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,400
in and increasingly successful at

1313
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
subverting trust relationships

1314
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,760
essentially supply chain intrusions but

1315
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,359
while that's very concerning and makes

1316
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,520
our lives a bit more difficult defenders

1317
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,000
still retain a number of advantages

1318
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,240
within this environment for detecting

1319
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,160
and defeating these intrusions by

1320
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,240
looking at essentially fundamentals of

1321
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,480
network security such as architecture

1322
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,520
visibility and active monitoring by

1323
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,680
good people within the environment we

1324
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,480
can begin uh addressing this issue and

1325
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,920
taking advantage of those controls those

1326
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,720
uh items that we retain that can make an

1327
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,520
adversary's life more difficult

1328
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,319
so with that uh i am finished so that's

1329
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,839
a relatively small print but you know

1330
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,480
reach out to me at gigamon or i don't

1331
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,000
check twitter as much as i used to back

1332
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,359
in the day so if you're familiar with my

1333
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,200
twitter account it's been quite quiet

1334
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,880
the last several weeks but i still check

1335
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,040
it you know hit me up there as well if

1336
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,280
nothing else this does as i said earlier

1337
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,119
relate to a long-form paper that goes

1338
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,480
into some of these items in greater

1339
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,200
depth i'll have that posted here linked

1340
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,800
in elsewhere so please look for that if

1341
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,559
this is a conversation that you found

1342
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,839
interesting or you'd like to bring this

1343
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,920
back to your own organization

1344
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,520
these slides will also be made available

1345
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,200
later and i have a number of resources

1346
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,559
that you could also look at for some of

1347
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,800
these specific incidents so with that i

1348
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,240
mean we think we have a few minutes

1349
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,079
before lunch for questions if anyone is

1350
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,580
interested

1351
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:03,480
[Applause]

1352
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,200
hi

1353
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,119
um how do you envision traffic

1354
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,520
visibility uh to be done in the future

1355
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,079
especially with new uh transpo protocols

1356
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,480
like quick and such that are upcoming

1357
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,160
yes no and it's getting hard and you

1358
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,440
know one of the failings of this

1359
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,720
presentation

1360
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,160
that i just didn't really have time to

1361
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,000
get into because it uh complicates

1362
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,520
things quite significantly are things

1363
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,599
like you know new transport protocols

1364
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,480
hybrid cloud environments by byod

1365
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,480
instances or whatever that push the

1366
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,160
perimeter out or even eliminate

1367
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,720
perimeters or segmentation possibilities

1368
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,960
and like the the very honest answer is

1369
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,160
that we need to start thinking about

1370
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,240
this now because i don't think very many

1371
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,079
people have been and it's going to

1372
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,800
result in a very nasty sort of situation

1373
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,400
when these sorts of items become more

1374
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,480
frequent so going back all the way to

1375
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,079
the beginning of the presentation like

1376
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:53,599
vulnerabilities are not supply chain

1377
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,839
intrusions no but they can be used to

1378
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,079
make them happen like the oh my god

1379
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,079
vulnerability and if you're operating in

1380
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,599
a hybrid cloud environment and your

1381
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,200
active directory server is sitting in

1382
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,240
azure

1383
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,440
while the rest of your network is

1384
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,920
on-prem well if my ad gets popped

1385
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,160
through communication mechanism pathways

1386
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,400
i have no visibility over and then i can

1387
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,160
swim directly from that very privileged

1388
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,040
incident instance into my own network

1389
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,280
defense becomes very hard so yes i don't

1390
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,040
have an easy answer to that question but

1391
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,319
these are the sorts of things that we

1392
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,720
need to start looking into immediately

1393
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,040
because that's where it is going and if

1394
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,480
we don't meet them there we're just

1395
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,000
going to end up with a very more

1396
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,559
efficient uh maybe notionally cheaper

1397
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,880
sort of deployment environments but with

1398
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,480
security implications that we haven't

1399
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,559
even considered yet

1400
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,839
so excellent question thank you for

1401
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,240
bringing that up

1402
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,559
yeah thank you for the presentation that

1403
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,079
was really interesting um

1404
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,599
relating to the

1405
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,520
what you are saying about architecture

1406
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,000
and so on uh i know that in my company

1407
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,480
there are pushes from the

1408
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,920
i.t architects to use zero trust

1409
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,760
architectures

1410
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,319
which make me very uncomfortable because

1411
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,559
i'm not ready to put my cranes in front

1412
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,400
of the internet

1413
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,720
so that's another thing to put to to

1414
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,880
keep in mind i suppose

1415
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,800
and

1416
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,079
relating to byod i think one of the big

1417
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,800
things that we need to push is

1418
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,200
security assurance and ensure that we

1419
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,240
have a contractual relationship with the

1420
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,079
with our suppliers

1421
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,200
um

1422
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,559
iso 62443 i think has got entire

1423
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,160
chapters on that

1424
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,960
and on our side we're meeting a lot of

1425
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,480
resistance to get that implemented from

1426
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,960
buyers sellers everyone basically no one

1427
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,880
wants to listen to us

1428
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,280
um do you have any experience relating

1429
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,400
to that

1430
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,640
sure so two items they're both very

1431
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,079
important so the zero trust one first um

1432
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,319
i i've received that as feedback from

1433
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,520
others it's like oh you solve these

1434
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,359
problems through zero trust like well

1435
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,359
what do you mean by zero trust and no

1436
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,640
one has a good answer for that there are

1437
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,559
many vendor-specific answers and like

1438
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,040
forester coined the term a few years ago

1439
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,400
go figure

1440
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,319
but i look at zero trust as not being

1441
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,400
the sort of deployment of any

1442
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,240
magical unicorn capability where like

1443
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,680
you said i could have this internet

1444
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,680
facing and it's fine like no zero trust

1445
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,720
is a

1446
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,960
sequence of overlapping controls that

1447
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,720
include fairly classic items like

1448
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,640
network segmentation along with better

1449
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,640
authentication management and

1450
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,160
authentication

1451
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,079
controls so

1452
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,240
yeah when people mention xero trust to

1453
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,920
me i like to point at them and say like

1454
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,440
this is actually a number of concepts

1455
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,440
that you're rolling under one label and

1456
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,119
some of these are fairly accessible and

1457
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,559
not all that new

1458
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,319
but are still quite powerful for the

1459
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,359
byod question that's a very nasty sort

1460
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,280
of environment because users don't want

1461
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,520
to install a

1462
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,280
mdm on their device that's like oh you

1463
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,720
could read my email it's like well i

1464
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,400
could read your company email

1465
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,559
and i think you know trying to look for

1466
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,240
not just security frameworks that can

1467
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,079
provide us with examples of how to

1468
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,079
implement this successfully but also

1469
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,079
looking for as much as i hate relying on

1470
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,240
technical controls in all cases but

1471
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,839
items that can do things like better

1472
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,839
segmentation and guest isolation on

1473
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,920
mobile devices so you could legitimately

1474
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,680
have

1475
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,760
personal and corporate enclaves on a

1476
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,520
device to minimize communication between

1477
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,280
the two which i think samsung tried to

1478
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,520
do with knox but knox never really got

1479
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,280
that much of a uh take take up and then

1480
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,079
looking at other uh controls for the mac

1481
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,079
os ios environment like i'm using a

1482
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,319
macbook right now i hate it i'm a linux

1483
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,480
guy um but a lot of those sorts of

1484
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,800
controls are

1485
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,040
not very elegant but then what you do if

1486
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,319
you have android phones and the

1487
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,319
solutions there leave much to be desired

1488
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,000
so yeah again like the earlier

1489
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,359
gentleman's question these are excellent

1490
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,280
things that we need to be addressing but

1491
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,480
i can't even think of a

1492
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,839
suitable answer right now and we're

1493
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,880
still trying to figure it out

1494
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,559
okay

1495
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,920
any last questions

1496
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,440
thank you everyone

1497
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,559
you
