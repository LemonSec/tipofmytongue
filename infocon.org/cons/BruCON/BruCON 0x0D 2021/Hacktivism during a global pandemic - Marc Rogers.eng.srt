1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,919
well uh i have to say it's it's an honor

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,280
to be here especially given that most of

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,920
us haven't had conferences in so long

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,039
i just did defcon in in july and it was

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,279
an amazing experience to be back amongst

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,240
my people again and to actually be able

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,640
to sit down and talk to people who could

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
understand what i'm talking about

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,920
it's

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,519
it's awesome so uh

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,360
i i kind of struggled with what to talk

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
about um

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
because i haven't actually done my usual

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,000
research during the pandemic

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,600
so instead i figured i'd talk a bit

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,559
about

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,719
the social side of hacking and

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,960
hacktivism and sort of where it's come

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,640
from and where it's going and gone

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,879
because i think a lot of people

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,879
think that hacktivism

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,160
is just one sort of dimensional thing

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,480
people breaking into websites dumping

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
files that kind of stuff there's

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,360
actually a lot more to it and i'm going

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,799
to go into that

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,640
so um

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,799
yep okay

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,320
oh so my biography um

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,080
i'm the hacker who looks like santa

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,119
claus um

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
i didn't look like this before covid it

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,759
was literally covered to do this to me

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,520
um and it's debatable whether i'm going

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,360
to keep it or not at least till

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,640
christmas anyway um

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,280
yeah so uh what i say i'm head of

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,560
security at defcon vp of cyber security

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,320
octa

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
one of the founders of the cti league

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
along with nate

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
um

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,360
oh yeah tech advisor to mr robots

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,880
um i'm part of the cdc and the cdc ninja

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,320
strike force and i generally break stuff

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
so this is probably one of the first

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,960
things i've done where i'm not breaking

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,360
something

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,439
this is a quote from veggie

50
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,840
last night and he says

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,560
hacktivism is more vibrant and alive

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,038
than it has ever been and i would agree

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,440
with him it's just have to look at where

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,720
it's gone

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,599
so

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,400
hacktivism is a social or political

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,560
activist act that's carried out by

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
breaking into a wreaking havoc on a

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
secure computer system that was the

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
definition from

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
um i remember who wrote it someone back

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
in the in the 90s

63
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
i actually completely disagree with this

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
i don't think that's hacktivism i think

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,280
that can be an aspect of activism

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,080
i think hacktivism much better aligns

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,720
with the mit definition of what a hacker

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,840
is

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,519
and

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,599
oh yeah

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,800
forgot about this um so a little bit of

72
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
inception uh here is a video of an

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,720
opening keynote in an opening keynote

74
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,159
and it was for an opening keynote

75
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,480
basically in 1997

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,000
beyond hope

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,440
uh paired up with hacking progress

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
and

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,080
while the conferences were linking up

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
we hacked hacking in progress and owned

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,560
all the computers in the tents

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,599
and owned the campsite computer

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,680
and basically as they woke up and did

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,519
their opening keynote we announced to

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,799
them that they'd just been completely

86
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,680
owned

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
and this video is of that moment and

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,799
it's basically me sitting with fibre

89
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,720
optic death veggie and cheshire catalyst

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,599
before we began here we decided to visit

91
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,200
the uh the web page of our sister

92
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,280
conference hacking in progress the hip

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,920
conference and as it turned out uh it

94
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,070
wasn't secure

95
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,460
[Laughter]

96
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,680
[Applause]

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
uh thanks to cyber junkie here uh maybe

98
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,760
he could explain um what it was that was

99
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,560
done

100
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,360
or

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,200
not done yeah i

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
don't look like that

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,000
this url again no www here uh it's

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
god.campsite.hip97.nl

105
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
i'm not sure if they fixed it or

106
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,200
modified it or whatnot but

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,040
they have a little diary going there of

108
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,959
what's happening

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,600
hip 97 dot nl

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
not hip that hip 97

111
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,249
[Applause]

112
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,479
you can see the technical side of

113
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,160
conferences we are waiting for something

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,880
in particular okay

115
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
oh that's bad

116
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,400
hopefully by tomorrow we'll have the

117
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,240
terminal up here so so we can actually

118
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,680
type as we speak

119
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
that would be neat okay connecting over

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,870
to holland now

121
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,130
[Applause]

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,560
okay this is the online diary they're

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,759
keeping a diary from their campsite

124
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,560
[Applause]

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,520
okay can we scroll down

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,919
keeps going

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,960
okay this is the hip uh

128
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,159
friday morning section

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
i like the font

130
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
click on it where it says hacked page

131
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
there

132
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,120
so

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
to most people that's hacktivism it's

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
like breaking into somebody's site

135
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
putting up some additional content maybe

136
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,080
doing a web defacement

137
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
like some of the examples here

138
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
but the reality is out of most of these

139
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
actions

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,039
the only ones that have persistence are

141
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,600
things like the pentagon papers

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
where substantial material was dumped

143
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,639
that ultimately changed things because

144
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,800
of the exposure of the information

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,319
when it comes to the

146
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
big web defacements of the 90s i doubt

147
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,680
anyone in this room remembers any of

148
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,880
them

149
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,560
and what you're looking at there is at

150
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
the top is

151
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,360
the cia homepage being defaced

152
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,919
and the bottom right is the

153
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,160
labour party webpage

154
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,720
just after tony blair was elected

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,880
so those were big deals at the time but

156
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,479
they didn't really last

157
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,520
and so

158
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,319
my kind of thesis is that

159
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,160
the more traditional view of

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
activism isn't really

161
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,720
that persistent or effective in making

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,160
change and there are other ways to do it

163
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
and

164
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
the other thing is because of this

165
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,440
this is pretty much what the world

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
perceives hacktivists to be

167
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,039
and

168
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,319
we're scary people who wear masks and

169
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,160
we break into things

170
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,319
and that's actually less helpful than

171
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,759
you might imagine

172
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,199
um in the work that i've been doing over

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,680
the throughout the pandemic i now find

174
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,280
myself sitting with law enforcement

175
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
officials governments

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
ngos

177
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,960
and it makes it really really difficult

178
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
and nate here can

179
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
testify to one of the biggest challenges

180
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,080
we had was as we found vulnerabilities

181
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,479
in facilities like hospitals

182
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,240
having one of us go up and knock on the

183
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
door and say hey

184
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
you've got a massively exposed piece of

185
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
infrastructure that

186
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,520
some russian gang could come in

187
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
infiltrate with ransomware and cause

188
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,880
huge problems

189
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,360
they just freak out like

190
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,199
they think it's some sort of shakedown

191
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,599
they think hackers are scary they don't

192
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,160
see any potential benefit in it

193
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,919
this image

194
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,280
is

195
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,919
really not great um and that's actually

196
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,120
one of the reasons why i set out

197
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
with mr robot to try and change some of

198
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,879
that image

199
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,840
and i got given an opportunity to work

200
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,400
from inside a tv series

201
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,039
and guide them on what they used and one

202
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,080
of the first rules i put down was

203
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,479
only use realistic techniques that a

204
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
hacker would use

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,960
and only use community tools the things

206
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
that we know people are using

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
and

208
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,520
and

209
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
like

210
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
why does hacktivism itself even have to

211
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
focus on these offensive technologies

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,039
you know aren't there other ways that we

213
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,560
can make change

214
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,080
using the skills that we have

215
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,559
if you look at the original definition

216
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,559
of what a hacker is

217
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,880
it came out of the mit model railway

218
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,200
club it was essentially somebody who

219
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,559
could change

220
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
a system

221
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,640
without destroying it i

222
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,880
adapt a system from within

223
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,839
or make a modification to it that didn't

224
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,600
destroy the original purpose but gained

225
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
an additional purpose

226
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,360
and i like to think that's the best

227
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,680
approach to hacking it's

228
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,240
going in and changing systems in such a

229
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,839
way that you get an outcome that you

230
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,800
want

231
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,560
but without necessarily destroying its

232
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,080
original purpose

233
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,519
and i think you can apply the same thing

234
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,120
to hacktivism

235
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
and so that brings up the cti league

236
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
nate if you want to join me

237
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,040
i kind of feel it's only fair because he

238
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,360
co-founded this with me

239
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,040
and

240
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,440
so the idea behind the cti league was

241
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
really just thrown together

242
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,680
a bunch of us were

243
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,120
not doing a lot during the pandemic um

244
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,640
we're sitting in front of keyboards

245
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
locked in our houses lots of extra

246
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
cycles to spend

247
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,640
uh and we wanted to defend healthcare

248
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,000
because we could see

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
criminals targeting healthcare more and

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
more

251
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,720
and

252
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,440
so

253
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,560
like

254
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,640
we came together

255
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,399
thanks mark um yeah like that's like

256
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,240
just like mark said um i think we

257
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,040
started it on march 13th to 2020. um

258
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,360
some of the impetus behind it uh i had

259
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
just come back from israel i had done a

260
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,160
talk about

261
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
using tools like showdown and grain

262
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
noise to assess network perimeter and

263
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,079
find holes in the gaps of your network

264
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,200
some of which you're going to see later

265
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,240
today

266
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,079
um so i'm sitting at work at microsoft

267
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,519
and i see this article about a czech

268
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,040
hospital that had just been ransomware

269
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
right and i had this sort of like

270
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
nightmare light bulb moment of like this

271
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,440
is a thing

272
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,920
so i used my access i downloaded all the

273
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
you know exposed i think they were f5

274
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,120
devices at the time

275
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
um no sorry they were citrix night

276
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,079
cigars i pulled them all down out of the

277
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,680
internet start doing some you know

278
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
command line magic and lo and behold i

279
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
find my own hospital like the doctors

280
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
have put my shoulder together after a

281
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,399
snowboarding accident has two of these

282
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,560
next year netscaler devices and i'm just

283
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,360
like

284
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,839
what do i do so i i quite literally went

285
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,120
on linkedin

286
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,160
because they didn't have a security

287
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
contact i go to the hospital there's no

288
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
security people like there's people that

289
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
call for physical security if you know i

290
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
need to be walked to the parking lot but

291
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,399
there was no link for any like

292
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,079
information security team no way to

293
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,680
reach them so i find a guy on linkedin

294
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
who says he works for the hospital send

295
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,680
him a connect request try to stuff into

296
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,000
200 characters like hey i found some

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,519
stuff that's exposed i'm not trying to

298
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,519
hack you i'm a patient i just want you

299
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,000
to know this thing nothing um and like

300
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,760
mark says that's that was that was the

301
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,360
moment where i was like this is a huge

302
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
problem and there's no way i can solve

303
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,279
it um so another gentleman hud had

304
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,399
reached out and said do you want to

305
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,000
start this thing with me and i'm like

306
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,079
sure i'll jump in i'll help out we

307
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,320
assumed we'd have maybe 30 40 people

308
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
playing around in their spare time i

309
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,079
think within a month we had 1500 people

310
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,920
from around the world it was like 120

311
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
countries that were represented um even

312
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
a gentleman from the pharaoh islands had

313
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,160
joined us um so yeah it was we managed

314
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,839
to stop a lot of attacks we worked ended

315
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,200
up partnering with u.s government

316
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,240
agencies um europol interpol

317
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
the nhs uk the list just goes on and on

318
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
and it was really kind of powerful to be

319
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
able to say hey we have all these skills

320
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
we're putting them to use we're trying

321
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
to defend hospitals for free

322
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,920
but like to mark's point we couldn't

323
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,519
they wouldn't listen to us we had to

324
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,040
partner with what are called ice acts in

325
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,360
the u.s um and let them somebody that

326
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,959
trusted that they already trusted talk

327
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,160
to them because every time we went and

328
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,760
reached out like you said it would be

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
everything from what are you talking

330
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,560
about to how much money are you trying

331
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,639
to blackmail me to like we need to get

332
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,560
our lawyers involved we're like no no no

333
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,240
we're just trying to tell you for free

334
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,680
that you need to go and fix this before

335
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,479
somebody gets in

336
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,720
and

337
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,639
one of the biggest thing things that

338
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,639
came out of this for me was we were

339
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,200
sitting down with some of the

340
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
agencies we were working with and they

341
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,120
basically said we have never worked with

342
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,040
civilians in this manner

343
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,079
and it's produced results that we just

344
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,040
couldn't didn't expect at all

345
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,000
it's

346
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,720
in a way now created a model

347
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,600
that

348
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,160
i'm seeing replicated i'm a member of at

349
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,639
least four other groups now that are

350
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,480
doing the same thing in different areas

351
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,639
so for example if any of you've heard of

352
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,839
the uh

353
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,160
special task force on ransomware i'm

354
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,920
part of the ransomware task force and

355
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
that's operating in a similar model

356
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,680
bringing together private sector

357
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,040
individuals

358
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,120
to work and assist

359
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,440
so that we can

360
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,600
act as force multipliers is probably the

361
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
best way of looking at it because

362
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,279
government agencies don't have enough

363
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
people to deal with this stuff

364
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
and even if they did they're going to

365
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
prioritize

366
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
big things and i'll mention this later

367
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,519
on but

368
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,040
small businesses

369
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,440
don't have the resources and they don't

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,079
have the budget and they don't have any

371
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,040
like the people to solve these problems

372
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,440
but if we're not fixing them

373
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,519
then we're really not fixing anyone

374
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,760
we're just fixing the giant hospitals of

375
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,720
the world

376
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,600
and

377
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,920
that's not going to help any of us

378
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,079
and one quote the best quote that we

379
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,440
heard when we were in there is somebody

380
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
from uh the csa agency in the united

381
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,199
states told us that we did in a month

382
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,720
what the us government had tried and

383
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,560
failed to do for 10 years

384
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
which was pretty cool

385
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,279
and i mean what this boils down to is

386
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,959
this is what the hacker mindset can do

387
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,800
when it's applied to government this is

388
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
working on the inside to change the way

389
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,760
they're doing things and there's still a

390
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,480
ton of work to do because a lot of these

391
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
agencies are still

392
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,199
incredibly reticent to engage they don't

393
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
understand the trust models inside

394
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,600
private sector and inside hackerspace

395
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,399
but

396
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,760
you know

397
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,399
it it's it's working

398
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,399
i'll skip over this like this is the

399
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,120
stuff we found in the first um

400
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,320
first month basically lots of old [ __ ]

401
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,959
stuff that should really have been fixed

402
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,399
long ago but

403
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,279
you know to the resourcing problem

404
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:35,660
yeah

405
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,880
[Music]

406
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,760
a lot of them knew about this stuff

407
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,680
thank you a lot of them knew about this

408
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,199
stuff but they just didn't have the

409
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,839
people to fix it

410
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,240
these are some of the agencies that we

411
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,079
ended up working with

412
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,519
about 10

413
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,040
of the membership

414
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,959
came from government and law enforcement

415
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,600
and from agencies all over the world

416
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,519
nate mentioned the pharaoh islands and

417
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,880
the pharaoh islands

418
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
cyber police represented i had no idea

419
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
the pharaoh islands had a sign of police

420
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,000
people from pretty much every continent

421
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,800
and that gave us reach that was just

422
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,599
unprecedented

423
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,199
so

424
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,880
what was the view of

425
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,160
hacking on tv and the view of hackers

426
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,560
before mr robot came along

427
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,519
i think

428
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,199
you know

429
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,320
we've all seen csi we've all seen

430
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,240
scorpion

431
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
like that's the reason i got involved in

432
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,040
the mr robot side of it and the reason i

433
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,800
essentially worked to hack hollywood was

434
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
i just

435
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,880
oh yeah

436
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,440
and of course afterwards

437
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,120
that's where we ended up

438
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,079
but

439
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
like any of you who have watched mr

440
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
robot

441
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
do any of you find any faults in any of

442
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,839
the hacks or any of the technologies

443
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,199
used

444
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,839
so it's doable we can make these shows

445
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,360
do the right thing

446
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,199
and it actually becomes

447
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,240
a pr opportunity for us because it shows

448
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,360
the world

449
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,160
what we can do in a responsible way

450
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,439
and it shows our power

451
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,519
so what are the other areas that we can

452
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,480
hack in

453
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,360
and

454
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
policy is a huge one

455
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,120
there are several bills going through

456
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,320
right now

457
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,759
that have

458
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,880
hackers involved to some extent or or

459
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,920
not

460
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,720
um

461
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,839
you can generally spot them uh if you

462
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,160
look up things like

463
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,600
the improving

464
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,959
iot cyber security act of 2020 in the us

465
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,320
and you look at the fact that it's got

466
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,519
some really

467
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,639
sensible

468
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,000
requirements in there you know it

469
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,680
doesn't go far enough but it's got some

470
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
brilliant

471
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,399
first steps

472
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,079
that's because the people who are

473
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,680
helping advise

474
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,519
had knowledge and the reason they had

475
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,680
knowledge is because

476
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,920
some of us were connected to them and

477
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,759
helping them with that

478
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,160
the reviews of things like the computer

479
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,720
misuse act or the computer fraud and

480
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
abuse act in the us

481
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,760
same deal

482
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,599
we've got people pushing from different

483
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,319
directions to improve this stuff and fix

484
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,039
it

485
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,720
and so we can literally rewrite the laws

486
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
that have been used against us and this

487
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,880
is a huge opportunity for us

488
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,959
and i want to see more people engage in

489
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,000
this way

490
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
you know talk to politicians

491
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,760
talk to aids

492
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,039
talk to

493
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,720
government groups

494
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
plug into all of these people and give

495
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,360
them the knowledge that you have because

496
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,440
it's guaranteed to be a hundred times

497
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,679
more than they already have access to

498
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,919
and if you help shape them

499
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,679
then the outcome is going to be way more

500
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,919
beneficial to you and to your future

501
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,400
careers

502
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
oh counter cyber crime activities so

503
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,039
ransomware task force

504
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,480
we are looking at working to

505
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
shape what industry does

506
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,840
in an industry

507
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,919
we are already taking countermeasures

508
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,679
against cybercrime

509
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,320
and what we can do is profoundly

510
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,120
different from what government can do

511
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,919
you know government has to follow

512
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,799
due process they have to follow various

513
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,039
treaties like mlat

514
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,600
and the chances of them dropping an

515
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,760
arrest warrant on say a

516
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,640
ukrainian cyber criminal are

517
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,240
slim to none

518
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,200
and sanctions being levied against

519
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,080
random russian dudes who then jump into

520
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,320
their lamborghinis and drive off is

521
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,160
not going to stop anything

522
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,760
but through private sector we have

523
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,919
access to trust relationships we have

524
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,400
access to uh organizational

525
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,760
relationships

526
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,840
and all of these things can be used and

527
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,480
can be weaponized against the economy

528
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,960
that these people are part of

529
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,440
this is a view that government has never

530
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,120
really looked at before

531
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,559
you know they

532
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,320
like to use sledgehammers to crack

533
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,720
walnuts but we can be a lot more subtle

534
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
about it and we can do it lawfully

535
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,600
without having to jump through the same

536
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,840
hoops that government has to follow

537
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,120
and the last one is um the

538
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,080
the cyber security poverty line

539
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,600
just looking at say the united states

540
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,559
about two-thirds of american

541
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,280
medical infrastructure is in five or ten

542
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,240
person facilities and those facilities

543
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
are not covered by any of the stuff that

544
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,880
you see going on you know

545
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,240
what are you gonna do walk into a

546
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
five-person dentist office and tell them

547
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,400
to follow the nist cyber security

548
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
framework

549
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,360
i can tell you it's not gonna have any

550
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,880
benefit

551
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,000
what we can do though is we can upscale

552
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,120
and we can help supply knowledge to

553
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,280
people like the mssps

554
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,600
and to those facilities and do the kind

555
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,640
of work that the cti league was doing

556
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,559
to provide resources to these

557
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,720
organizations that don't have it and to

558
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
help shape what they're doing and

559
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,000
provide protection for them

560
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,640
so what do we need to do

561
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
basically

562
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,400
we just need to keep on doing what we do

563
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
best and we need to show the world

564
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,679
that

565
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,440
we are

566
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,840
better at cyber security

567
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,760
than any of them

568
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
and we need to use the skills that we

569
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,039
have

570
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,000
to change stuff from within the truest

571
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,799
form of hacking

572
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,880
and well

573
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
let's not be the meme

574
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,159
like

575
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,480
let's not be the guys in masks who are

576
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,400
scaring people and who are

577
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,760
causing

578
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
arbitrary damage

579
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,080
opportunistic stuff can work

580
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,640
but i think targeted deliberate

581
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,159
uh str

582
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,080
staged work

583
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,320
is always going to be better

584
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,158
longer lasting and more effective

585
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,590
hack the planet

586
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,270
[Applause]

587
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,760
[Applause]

588
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,200
questions or

589
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,159
yeah anyone have any questions

590
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,559
what are the first steps

591
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,000
what are the first steps that they

592
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
should take or that

593
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,480
you should take

594
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,280
uh trust and information flow because

595
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,080
one of the biggest challenges we have is

596
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,480
when you're working on specific projects

597
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,559
targeting groups

598
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,640
you have to deconflict what you're doing

599
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
from what the government's doing but

600
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
it's impossible to do that without a

601
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
flow of information

602
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,159
many government agencies provide a

603
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,520
single channel i.e they receive they'll

604
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,600
take information from you they'll go off

605
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,440
and do stuff with it but they won't feed

606
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,360
back and tell you

607
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,000
actually we're working on this or

608
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,360
this is going to be a problem because of

609
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,280
that they may tell you to stop but

610
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
they're not going to give you guidance

611
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
and that lack of guidance means you

612
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,200
can't

613
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,320
coordinate efforts the reality is if we

614
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,679
want to be

615
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,000
effective against groups like

616
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
russian ransomware we're going to have

617
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,000
to be organized

618
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,200
we need

619
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
the power of government pushing down at

620
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,440
the same time as the power of industry

621
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,799
and the power of the information

622
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,159
security community

623
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,720
and pushing into the same places

624
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,919
so

625
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,159
it's information flow but it's also

626
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,120
trust

627
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,280
both of which don't come easily to

628
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,840
government

629
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,639
anyone else

630
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,840
don't give me a microphone it's not

631
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,919
interesting um yeah i'm just about to

632
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,080
say that uh your beard is fantastic and

633
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,520
and i tried to do that it got really

634
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,840
itchy and any tips on that because

635
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,760
drink lots of beer

636
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,640
there's my mistake okay

637
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,559
[Applause]

638
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,440
no further questions

639
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,240
about organizations that don't have okay

640
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,679
thank you sorry

641
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,279
about the gap about organizations that

642
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,360
might not have the resources like like

643
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,000
for example an ngo or something that you

644
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,960
know

645
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,159
uh

646
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,919
a lot of the problem there is just that

647
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,039
they don't have the same amount of

648
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,640
resources as a large organization to

649
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
come and pay for the work

650
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,159
to a certain extent you know you can go

651
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,679
enough for your help but i don't know if

652
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,679
you have any advice on what might be the

653
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,360
best ways to actually go and help such

654
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,120
an organization that does not have the

655
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,720
resources not have the equipment doesn't

656
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,960
have the money but what do i what can i

657
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
actually do for them

658
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,279
so

659
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,880
one of the first places to start is

660
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,279
literally at the beginning um i've been

661
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,400
doing a little bit of work with the

662
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,799
cyber peace institute in uh

663
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,240
in geneva

664
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,120
and

665
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,600
what i've been pushing them towards is

666
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,120
when you

667
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,840
deploy ngos or when you

668
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,159
facilitate the deployment of ngos into

669
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,320
spaces let's bake some cyber security in

670
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,480
if you start them with at least a

671
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,640
reasonable security posture

672
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,720
then they're going to be way better off

673
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,799
than just some random group

674
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,720
dumping something into

675
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,679
part of the african continent or or into

676
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,480
a disaster zone so step one is

677
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
you can get in there at the start and

678
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,559
help guide them in terms of this is what

679
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,480
you need to do i mean in some ways it's

680
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,400
almost like being a virtual cso for a

681
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,720
small startup it's okay these are the

682
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
resources we've got

683
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
this is how you do this in a sensible

684
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,400
and secure way

685
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,200
the

686
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,880
the next step is

687
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,600
uh the ongoing monitoring side of it

688
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,919
we can keep an eye on them and see when

689
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,840
things come up because they're not going

690
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,279
to be monitoring their infrastructure

691
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,520
for the latest vulnerabilities that

692
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,080
suddenly appear on twitter or which get

693
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,360
dropped into

694
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,720
mitre or whatever but we can do that

695
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,760
in the cti league we were producing

696
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,120
somewhere in the region of two to four

697
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
thousand vulnerabilities a month just

698
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,919
from using things like showdown to keep

699
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,600
scanning infrastructure

700
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,000
so there's work that we can do that

701
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,919
the challenge is to make sure that

702
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,240
you're tied into a good organization so

703
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,919
that you have the reporting channels

704
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,880
because

705
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
you then run into the problems that we

706
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,039
had in cti league which is okay you find

707
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,240
this stuff

708
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,279
how do you get them to action it and

709
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,520
the second problem is

710
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,799
how do you get someone to physically

711
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
make the changes to fix it because you

712
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,440
know boots on the ground is not always

713
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,559
practical

714
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,279
if you're talking about something like

715
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,320
an earthquake disaster like like haiti

716
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,679
you're not going to fly someone out

717
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,360
there to fix some vulnerable

718
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,640
infrastructure

719
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,440
and

720
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,159
so working with the ngos themselves into

721
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,679
understanding how to fix this stuff is

722
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,559
good

723
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,360
um building tooling that will help them

724
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,400
with stuff

725
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
and a lot of the vulnerabilities that

726
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,400
these organizations suffer from are

727
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,000
really quite simple

728
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,039
you know they're things like uh exposed

729
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,960
services like rdp

730
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,720
that should have should either be turned

731
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,039
off or should have better security put

732
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,799
in front of them like strong passwords

733
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,440
multi-factor so on and so forth a lot of

734
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,799
this stuff is

735
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,640
is stuff that's actually not that hard

736
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,200
to fix and not that hard to guide them

737
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,880
on

738
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,559
later on we are going to have to deal

739
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,120
with the bigger stuff but honestly if we

740
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,279
deal with the low hanging fruit

741
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,200
that's enough to keep us going for quite

742
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,279
some time and it's going to rule out by

743
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,039
a significant percentage of the attacks

744
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,279
anybody another question yes

745
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,039
there's a lot of issues with uh the

746
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,399
trust that's not there but other

747
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,480
countries in the world where you think

748
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
they're ahead of the game where it's a

749
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,679
lot easier to work with the governments

750
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,240
and stuff or

751
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,240
ironically i think the us is one of the

752
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,480
places that's easier to work with and i

753
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,640
think a big part of that is because they

754
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,720
had the loft moment

755
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,120
and the loft testifying in front of the

756
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,799
senate created a

757
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,240
a relationship and a view of opportunity

758
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,679
that has helped drive things going

759
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,039
forward and so

760
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,440
there is more opportunity in the us and

761
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,320
so

762
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,480
when you look at the number of law

763
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,559
enforcement folks

764
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,600
on the cti league i would say probably

765
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,799
60 to 70 percent of them were us-based

766
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,399
law enforcement

767
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,559
as a result of that other countries are

768
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,720
starting to catch up

769
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,039
we've had good engagement from a number

770
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,600
of different european states

771
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,120
actually had really surprising

772
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,080
engagement from some

773
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,640
some places like

774
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
vietnam and

775
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,440
south korea

776
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,200
but i think

777
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,960
most are still lagging because there is

778
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
still fundamentally this

779
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,480
this distrust

780
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,399
and

781
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,360
one of the challenges is they don't want

782
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,159
a

783
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,320
person who's not under their control

784
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,039
to know what their weaknesses are

785
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,159
and so

786
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,640
we have to show them that you know

787
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,399
this information is already out there

788
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,960
it's not hard to scan this

789
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
infrastructure and find

790
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,480
find problems

791
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,720
and if we can do it

792
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,880
anyone any one of their enemies can do

793
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,799
it so the problem is not holding on to

794
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,159
the information

795
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,080
and the problem is actually acting on

796
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,000
that information fast enough

797
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,960
and i hope through uh example

798
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,640
we're going to convince more and more

799
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,279
states to do this especially given that

800
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,919
if you look at the the volume of attacks

801
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,440
that has

802
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,039
arisen in you know 2020 and 2021

803
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,840
this swamped like every law enforcement

804
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,080
group in the world is completely swamped

805
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,000
and they know that they have to get help

806
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,279
from somewhere

807
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,200
and i'm hoping they realize that you

808
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,679
know help is right there they just need

809
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,080
to ask us

810
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,320
thank you

811
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
yeah see someone over there give me a

812
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,480
sec

813
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,039
thank you

814
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,039
not really a question more of an offer i

815
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,240
am one of the people working for the

816
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,080
belgian government so if anyone needs

817
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
place to go to with questions or remarks

818
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,320
or any feedback on the government parts

819
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,080
definitely just talk to me thanks

820
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,480
now you open an invite man that's uh

821
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,279
see

822
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,559
actually this

823
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,799
is stuff that's great

824
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,960
um in the past

825
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,000
you would have government

826
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,480
representatives coming to conferences

827
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,520
and they would

828
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,440
fly under the radar as much as possible

829
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,679
in fact you know defcon created spot the

830
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,559
fed for the for that very reason

831
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,919
but nowadays

832
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,320
it's a lot more open and i think that

833
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,000
openness is at least i hope that

834
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,399
openness is being driven by trust

835
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,240
and the fact that there there is an

836
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,120
opportunity for us to engage is great

837
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,880
um

838
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
this year at defcon was kind of weird

839
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,720
because of covid um

840
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,080
but we had a whole bunch of different

841
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,600
agencies show up

842
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
the previous year we had congressmen and

843
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,519
senators

844
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,799
show up and walk around and talk

845
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,399
that level of engagement is an

846
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,080
opportunity that

847
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
we would never would have seen

848
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,240
five ten years ago

849
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,039
and i kind of hope it continues

850
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,600
uh there's there was some pushback when

851
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,960
uh jeff uh jeff moss my boss

852
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,480
invited the secretary of dhs

853
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,640
to come to defcon and i have to admit i

854
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,720
had my own kind of conflicting views

855
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,440
like

856
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,919
some of the stuff that dhs has done is

857
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,440
very problematic

858
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,840
but at the same time the opportunity to

859
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,080
engage at that level

860
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,279
is

861
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,320
a really valuable opportunity for us to

862
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,640
shape things and hopefully to change

863
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,919
minds

864
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,919
and if we can change

865
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,720
minds about just one aspect of what we

866
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,600
do

867
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,360
that's going to impact us going forward

868
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,600
in ways that breaking a website never

869
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,840
would

870
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,279
any more

871
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,600
doesn't look like it

872
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,080
any more questions

873
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,159
that case they can only say mark thank

874
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,519
you very much

875
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,440
it's been a pleasure picking your brain

876
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,399
it's literally our honor to have you

877
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,000
here man thank you very much

878
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,840
a pleasure to be here and i really hope

879
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,960
to see more of you guys engage

880
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,640
because like i'm getting old

881
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,960
and i need some of you younger folks to

882
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,039
come in and take over some of this stuff

883
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,640
because we have an opportunity to change

884
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,600
the world

885
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,159
and having you guys do that

886
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,200
is

887
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
my biggest wish

888
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,290

889
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:10,960
