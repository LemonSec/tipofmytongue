7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,160
quite a lot of people we were sold out

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,760
very early

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,640

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,880

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,640
and running

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
even though the circumstances were tough

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,399
it's all good it's gonna be an awesome

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,960
addition now

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,360
yeah so like cohen said we we were

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,120
hoping we could sell more tickets

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,480
unfortunately we're limited to this

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,000
amount of people but you know what this

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,840
is the right amount i'm sure we're going

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,680
to make another awesome group on edition

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,239
this is our 13th edition

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,239
some uh some information for you guys to

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,440
take into account so there will be a ctf

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,199
we're going to hang up the instructions

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,000
with some qr codes so it's totally safe

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,760
to scan some random qr codes

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,840
the same applies to the booklet the

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,000
booklet will be digital we'll also make

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,320
sure that different urls and qr codes

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
again will be put up everywhere feel

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,680
free to scan them no problems

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
the cups and things to drink those are

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,680
this year we started with using reusable

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
cups so when you're done drinking you

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
can return them back you're supposed to

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,560
pay

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,079
a deposit for that and then you'll get

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,680
your cups back

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,280
i think that's about it what i wanted to

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,520
do today the badge all of you got a

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,640
badge

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
totally in team

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,880
it checks the air quality around you

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,799
if the badge detects the quality is bad

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,200
the lead will light up red

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
it also doubles as an alcohol sensor

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,679
well the rest is up to you
