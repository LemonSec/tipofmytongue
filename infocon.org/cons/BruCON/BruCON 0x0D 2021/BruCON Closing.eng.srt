these guys are getting is a

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
universal travel adapter it's something

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,000
we bought for last year's edition

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,240
and obviously for

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,079
the obvious reasons we were not able to

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
hand them out last year and it's kind of

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
insulting to hand something out for

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
travel when you're not allowed to travel

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,479
so anyway

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,719

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719

55
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,240

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,079

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,000
t-shirts this year

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,040
also

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
thanks to corona we had a little issue

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,758
with the manufacturer

61
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,040

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
did them all by hand so anybody who

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,440
bought a t-shirt

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,680
every single one's unique

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,280

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,360

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,560

announcement to make i think well it is

100
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,959
i mean i'm sure you guys understand that

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,400
it's been a special year for us to

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,319
organize and we actually decided around

103
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,319
may that we said okay we're gonna do

104
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,920
this this year

105
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
knowing how difficult it's been taking

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
that commitment and being here right now

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000
is for us an honor literally an honor

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,480
having you all you guys over here being

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
able to organize it even we were not

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
allowed to have the amount of people

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
that we wanted to and we had to decline

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,959
a lot of people

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,040
it's still great to be back and honestly

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,479
that for us is the biggest honor we

115
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,840
could have

116
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,080
now for next year's edition which will

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,840
certainly take place but unfortunately

118
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,479
it will not be in this area because this

119
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,400
hour is going to be reconstructed for

120
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,160
probably the next two or potentially

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
three years

122
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,160
so we will as a crew start looking out

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
for a new location as of next year at

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,639
least for the next two years potentially

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,919
longer

126
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:46,800
so

127
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,840
say goodbye to this beautiful building

128
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,759
it will be reconstructed we'll see

129
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,160
whether we ever come back again

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
but we've spent at least i think what is

131
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,800
it seven or eight years here probably

132
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
eight and honestly we always get a lot

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,240
of good feedback this is an amazing haul

134
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
we get to present in something so old

135
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,400
yet so unique

136
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,960
and we hate to say goodbye to it we

137
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,800
don't have any option but we'll make

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,080
sure to find an equal place for you guys

139
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,440
and make sure that we're ready for next

140
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,320
year

141
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,479
so whenever we have that do keep an eye

142
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,560
on us on twitter but we'll make sure

143
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
that we're ready and that will come back

144
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
next year guys

145
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,759
thank you very much and thank you for

146
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,080
joining guys
