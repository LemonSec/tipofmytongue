1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,349
our next presenter is mark and he leads
their rights game if security here in

2
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:13,530
Europe he already has a history with
broken and today markets going to talk

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:24,400
about his experience with Dr games
itself so let's give a warm welcome and

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:33,070
thank you and everyone here ok cool
thanks very much for stand although i

5
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,840
guess im you're actually stand for the
dinner rather than the presentation but

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,230
I you know hopefully enjoy hopefully no
one's ever since I enters my position at

7
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:49,160
the minute ok cool so I work Fri games
on this presentation is really about

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,459
building a security program from scratch
which is two and a half years ago I

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,909
joined ride in May 2013 just kind of
talks about the challenges are expressed

10
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:05,729
or sorry that we face as a team talked
about some of the incidents talked about

11
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,979
what we did with those incidents and
then really how we leveled up our

12
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,939
security program and then we move it
onto some of the futures and things that

13
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:20,240
we want to do an entity and will do a
Q&A session of any questions can you

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,020
give them to the Q&A and I'll try to
answer everything ok otherwise fantastic

15
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,130
2011 afterwards just please approach me
and if you play the game I have some

16
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,170
skin cards left couple of people came up
and I was like ok to want to skincare

17
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,050
dinner like yeah and then it's like you
have any friends and they're like yeah

18
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,780
one so I every gamer seems to have one
friends I don't know if that's a good

19
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:52,780
thing or bad thing but hey Chris it
doesn't work

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:02:04,119
yeah yeah this is your gender pretty
much as I said little bit more of an

21
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,149
introduction now so this basically show
some of the things that I can do also

22
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,750
shows that I can operate a JSON
validator on the Internet

23
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,630
taxi trickier than it looks but that's
what happens when you move more into

24
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:26,140
leadership and management and then how
many games do we have here so many

25
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:32,619
people know what I'm MOBA is ok cool so
mobile for those who don't know the

26
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,019
multiplayer online partner in a league
of Legends as most people know the

27
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,800
agency just don't know right how many
people when they played games when

28
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,750
you're younger were told by their
parents that you wouldn't get them in

29
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,440
the morning wouldn't get them a job
right I'm one of those people as well

30
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,540
and I can't prove that wrong this is
shinobi anyone remember one of my most

31
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,040
favorite games ever and this is the
second one this is probably my opinion

32
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,640
the best Mario Kart over and 64 so when
right approach me I was working for

33
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,290
MongoDB and I was like it's gonna start
up and I was like no sequel database

34
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,140
forces game no single database forces
game and it wasn't really you know much

35
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,700
of a choice so I was like a kid coming
into account the shop so what was a

36
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:33,709
candy shop like so 17 offices worldwide
two thousand-plus writers so it's not a

37
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,019
big company but she's geographical
spread right select if you think a most

38
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:41,100
companies they might have 50,000
employees and they might have twenty

39
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,670
offices but the whole thing about gaming
is to localize the game right we want to

40
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,869
reach out to the player and the best
place to do that is through to the

41
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,340
player as local as possible now the
thing with all these offices is that

42
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,630
they all have an internet connection
right therefore they're also a really

43
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,000
cool attack vector and that's one of the
big challenges that we have but

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,590
but what we doin writers like we totally
emphasize teamwork were sports team and

45
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,480
everyone's autonomous which brings its
own challenges but enables us to be

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,560
creative and innovative so you know
there is a perfect example of us being

47
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,220
innovative and creative designers are
part of a team is gonna rock dude coming

48
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,110
in with no health threat team vs Blue
team and then literally team gets wiped

49
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,530
up that's the type of environment riders
you know one person goes in and then

50
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,969
everyone goes in miami is a key
component of our success and it's

51
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,210
important that we can all use it
effectively to grow to learn but it's

52
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,960
also important that we do it as part of
a team so what is this team mark bring

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,640
it brings pretty impressive starts but
this is all about the player and we

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,789
never would have got these thoughts
about how about the player so then the

55
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,320
challenges as a joint riders like how do
you how do you work at such a scale and

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,580
bring security from something that
wasn't really at the forefront wasn't

57
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,490
part of our DNA to become part of that
DNA right so in addition to these

58
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:15,750
figures we have a data warehouse it's
like 12 petabytes of millions of lines

59
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:22,510
of code multiple languages which servers
you know process like billions of events

60
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:29,409
per second per server so it's huge and
this was one of the events that brought

61
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:42,210
it home to me so many people know this
is really interactive

62
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,659
yeah so this is so on South Korea this
was the stadium that held the opening

63
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,789
match to the World Cup in 2002 she not
have this really modern event which is

64
00:05:53,789 --> 00:06:02,490
like five guys playing five guys and
naturally they're all Asian pass through

65
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,750
much better kings and there's like
42,000 people watching which just blew

66
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,930
my mind away so I travel from Dublin's a
soul to watch any sports event like this

67
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,240
is something that I never really thought
about but for me it was incredibly

68
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,849
humbling how one game you know can do
this and I just was going back to the

69
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:30,219
kid in a candy store just so lucky to be
there so time is all together like we

70
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,120
aspire to be the most focused games
company in the world everything is about

71
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,349
the player and you may think that that's
just talk but from the moment I joined

72
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:46,099
it was literally every single day like
it here in conversations you know so

73
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:49,979
it's up to us to use our own creativity
in judgment but always thinking about

74
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,539
the player before we implement a
solution right so if you work in a bank

75
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,240
you can kind of go hey we need to do
security I'm going to talk to your

76
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,990
manager your money just monitor right
and you could get a warning or something

77
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,780
like that I can't do that the team
counter that we can't approach security

78
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,698
in that way because we want to play
focused we also want to understand

79
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,780
players and in order to understand
there's we have to play games how many

80
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,909
people know games that work on TCP port
in TCP 443 appear to be less like and

81
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,240
that's it

82
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,860
are there many know right so you can't
really say hey put a proxy there and

83
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,229
it's gonna security thing it just
doesn't really work and then in addition

84
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,849
you can't we can't damage that
creativity or the ability to move fast

85
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:44,300
so good example is everyone remember
this so

86
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,430
because we want to be there focused we
want as many people as possible to play

87
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:55,310
the game and in one area of the world in
particular XP legal or illegal

88
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:02,509
is the predominant operating system it's
it's it's like 12 to 15 percent so if

89
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,669
you run on XP they're typically run and
I E 6400 XP right of support here on a

90
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:13,859
sixer of support she can populate either
an issue that software you only have a

91
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,669
self III you can't operator libraries
right so we had a choice for one area of

92
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:25,219
the world or by in order to protect
ourselves against

93
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:29,500
but more importantly to protect eighty
to ninety percent of our players in that

94
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,039
region we needed to upgrade against
brutal but what we would do is we would

95
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,588
not I tend to 15% right so we actually
used for a long time deciding which one

96
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:46,920
to do do we make a date if I force and
vulnerable for no fault of their own or

97
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,709
do we blocked and the 15% employers from
playing the game it was a really

98
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:57,729
difficult choice for us and that's what
their focus means from a security

99
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:05,810
perspective

100
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,709
ok so now we move on to a little better
by the security challenges that faced

101
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:19,000
when we started so these are our
philosophy so whenever we deploy code

102
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,980
applications services so you can see
that security is a key for us me but it

103
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,660
hasn't always been so our challenge is
to get it to the forefront of everyone's

104
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,110
mind to become part of the danny and I
talked about and if you look at if you

105
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,210
look at League of Legends again you'll
see like a hockey stick around in terms

106
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,130
of popularity exceeded anyone's
expectations right and in order to

107
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,550
satisfy that popularity and to scale you
know security isn't necessarily going to

108
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,579
be one of the core philosophies and to
be honest I was actually quite right

109
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:02,420
you know a risk call is made however
what brought us the agility and ability

110
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,479
to scale brought us the wild wild west
of you know cloud computing to be

111
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,610
specific for Computing in general so
here's an example that will walk through

112
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,830
everyone's familiar with AWS anyone not
familiar with AWS so this kind of turned

113
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,290
until like a one day as a run for mayor
of this story where the ops team are

114
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,860
really moving out fossston the developer
wants something out yesterday saddam

115
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,680
basically a developer goes and goes up
clout I'm going to play my own shit out

116
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,620
there and go to work and it's gonna be
magic and that's kinda what happened and

117
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,780
one team and they're like oh and my own
account and email on the PC and phone in

118
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,160
the cloud I need to go back to the stuff
that I have my corporate network so I

119
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,250
need a VPN connection that's probably
the only secure but the fact that the

120
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,220
VPN and then another team hears about it

121
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,730
cool I'm gonna get out of the cloud to
cloud awesome magic

122
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:07,899
and then you're like oh now I need to
stage an account and now I need a test

123
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:18,940
account or 45 cents and then you end up
with this right and this is what we call

124
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,750
tactic and it's probably also
self-service what cell service not quite

125
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,350
correct

126
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:33,880
from a management perspective and
administration perspective an

127
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:40,100
investigation perspective this is quite
hard and we're trying to think like how

128
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,279
do I actually explain text and then
someone did really well on the internet

129
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:51,120
for me as usual she think you're the
first person I've done it probably read

130
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,070
well everyone remember Tetris and that
frustration kind of like protectiveness

131
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:04,870
ok so bring a little bit more specific
now and talking about some of the

132
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:11,350
challenges that we saw in the last
couple of years and riot and these

133
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,190
challenges kind of prompted us to move
in a different direction

134
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:24,839
everyone remember kept rolling luggage
so you think right if you if you play

135
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,089
online games are you develop online
games you're you're doing something fun

136
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:38,930
right it's kinda cool it's exciting but
unfortunately when you bring online

137
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:45,790
gaming when your main demographic is
like 15 to 30 year old males and bring

138
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,849
in a competitor of competitive element
you don't really see a lot of maturity

139
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,019
you don't really see unemotional
dispassionate reactions so if you're

140
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,600
playing ranked and you're like hey I'm
going to improve from level to level X

141
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,089
plus one and you start losing and your

142
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,199
for a technical you know what's the
natural reaction when natural reaction

143
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:14,569
is to join the squad and start to toss
in the game that you enjoy this wasn't

144
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:19,128
just you know symptomatic 22 right of
Legends valve get here

145
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:26,499
PlayStation Network they get here in a
bunch of other games smite so NDP

146
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:31,569
amplification was like the really big
one and it was actually still be the one

147
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:36,240
that is we thought at the time that was
a 400 megabytes a second and then we

148
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,019
talked to the upstream providers and
they were like hey it was actually

149
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:46,709
around 600 which is bigger than you know
what are our companies like we'll talk

150
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:52,729
talk about but basically it took down
most of the northwest of urs right so

151
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,569
like that's Portland of this year I
don't like that type of area so that

152
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:03,449
there was a huge community effort you
know things like PCP 38 bogen filters

153
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:08,729
bringing in like sort port blocking and
then and then you also get things likes

154
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,439
influence in STP amplification but from
you take apart your mission statement

155
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:18,550
with impaired focused this is a really
crop experience right cuz what are you

156
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,769
going to do when you know you've
finished your day of work are you finish

157
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,639
school you just want to play a game with
your buddies but you can't because

158
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:32,410
someone's Dawson and sweet and innocent
do not and those were like interesting

159
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,360
times a lot of long nights and stuff and
i dont wanna say which solved it because

160
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,949
someone probably to eat up and down some
of the property losses so they start to

161
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:51,579
move in on the incident to incident to
everyone from any regret it and the

162
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:56,258
importance of radical imma be in like
the first person to know something so

163
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:02,249
this is something that's more like an
internal kind of issue in terms of like

164
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:06,850
every company before we release stuff
we'll talk about it internally people

165
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,249
have access to it in order to be
innovative and creative we really did

166
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:14,540
fall to trust the right so you've gone
through pretty hard hiring process and

167
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,219
if you succeed down and we immediately
to fall to trust you right

168
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,520
so you can have access to art assets
access to information and some people

169
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,300
make by judgment calls and its offer
that like five second reddit karma we

170
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,430
get like you know + 96 or things like
that and then you're like oh cool I

171
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:39,760
Credit Karma and I lost my job
competition and then finally the 13th so

172
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,880
this is against the first two were like
more common over time and this is one

173
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,700
frankly was not common but this happened
to me in my short month in riot tylerton

174
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:59,470
network so does anyone who plays League
of Legends remember this anyone feel

175
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:07,170
sorry for me know it's pretty much
sucked and this was against an instant

176
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:11,479
that formed my opinions on a lot of the
things that we needed to do so we have

177
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,630
suffered from a lack of visibility and
really it was like lack of alignment on

178
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,520
security and i can understand the
non-security from a lot of people who

179
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,220
write it was quite clear that there was
a lot of work to do but equally if you

180
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,930
think a black about the hockey stick
graph and the growth and you know people

181
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:40,300
doing amazing stuff like a lot of the
artwork in this presentation is done by

182
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,760
something someone who's very creative
clearly not me cause I can try but you

183
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,930
know I can't damage that and innovation
and we're gonna raise security so as a

184
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:59,069
result the actual environment to two and
a half years ago was firefighting right

185
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,610
and then more firefighting more fire
fighting again we already did awareness

186
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,630
training but we need to improve that
awareness training to get better

187
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:12,020
alignment we had tech deck which is only
natural because the legends grew faster

188
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,230
than any one ever expected

189
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:23,030
and our mission statement is like to
have a genre defining game right skills

190
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,470
faster than anyone expected but a lot of
catching up to do from a security

191
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,090
perspective but we still have to
remember everything is by the player

192
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:37,090
right so you gotta remember why ramp up
security if it means that the player can

193
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:54,260
play the game now is something that we
had to think about every day

194
00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:00,760
some of the sections are some of the
things that we we did in order to run

195
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:16,150
security up as anyone like to stick

196
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,920
so as I was saying we hire smart people
put them through an extensive interview

197
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:28,730
process an order that when they join we
know that they have the basis to succeed

198
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:36,250
in Excel so when I stood by and we
talked about it as the team while we

199
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,950
were like we need to see ourselves as a
support organization right as a support

200
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,630
team and when people move in the
leadership you hear them talk a lot

201
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,950
about you know how you need to support
your team right and that's really what

202
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,990
we need to do is to security team when
he did it to support riders in order so

203
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,480
they could succeed create innovate

204
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:05,850
the player but they're in a secure
fashion so we brought that down to 33

205
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:11,330
elements one was like to socialize and
my socialized it's kind of hard because

206
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,530
if you think about gamers are not
exactly the most extroverted you know

207
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,780
group of people in the world right to
count really typically string two words

208
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:25,389
together they all wear black might have
pearson's and they don't see sunlight so

209
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:31,420
I was a little bit of a challenge and
whilst socialize and we need to be

210
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,020
careful of the message and how we
deliver it right we need to create

211
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,670
alignment it's not like hate you go do
this because I said it's literally like

212
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,600
hey we think you should do it and here's
why and then eventually come to a

213
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,540
solution that maybe eighty percent of
the original solution you proposed but a

214
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:58,120
hundred percent alignment so in in in
riot we operate a lot of methodology we

215
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,399
used quite extensively sometimes you can
burn but if you look at idea I'll we

216
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,500
typically have product and techniques
right so if we want the team to adopt

217
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,750
something I typically have to get the
product owner and the tech elite to the

218
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,490
product owner is the person who is like
this is what I want the team to do the

219
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,180
tech leaders like this is how you will
do it right so in order to build an

220
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,300
alignment those the people that you need
to work with and then there's also a

221
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,139
rule called Development Manager

222
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:36,200
people everyone know what a development
manager is a project manager but like

223
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,790
modern-day kind of Scrum methodology in
new title and that's the person that

224
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,520
organizes the work for the team to lose
the type of people that we need to get

225
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,340
aligned with where we want to go and we
obviously need to prove success

226
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,850
tangible benefits and you know put it
into a common language so take a tighter

227
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,340
security line which is a common language
and actually reach out and that's the

228
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,129
important thing is that we weren't doing
up before reaching out and putting

229
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,690
things in the common language and
alignment is has been absolutely

230
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,440
essential to anything we tried to do and
then things like visibility was a big

231
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,690
thing that I noticed from a tax
perspective journey incidences that we

232
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,250
didn't have the visibility that we
wanted to and was like how do I put that

233
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,630
visibility into the network but there it
so people can still play games still be

234
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:37,050
creative and innovative and I'm not
getting abused by being so she talked to

235
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:44,129
and some of the guys from Patsy they
have a phrase in the phrases don't be a

236
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:49,100
dick so that's why we couldn't be a
takeover we're gonna be takes then

237
00:21:49,100 --> 00:22:00,530
probably be fired this is the approach
that we took so for this I followed the

238
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,560
philosophy of someone else's already
done it you might as well just still

239
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:10,290
rather than come up with your own phrase
and I can really put it any better than

240
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,260
this is absolutely crucial Danny thing
we've done

241
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:29,710
so how do we become blind eye to become
embraced so we looked at our awareness

242
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,440
training and we wanted to make it fun we
didn't organize pool parties like this

243
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,530
but you know we talked about making
things visual

244
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,170
talked about how to related to being a
gamer constantly thinking of the player

245
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,280
I'm not taking the traditional security
approach that's like a mad God I know

246
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,110
everything from security you got to do
my way we actually went out to finance

247
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,560
people to people who just started and
riot to engineers you know when we trust

248
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,270
that they know things about their
subject matter that we don't know if we

249
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:06,370
listen to their concerns but we then put
into their language

250
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,629
with you i no training this is kind of
where we do something on the right we

251
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,150
actually use compliance

252
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,850
like our own kind of good like you have
to do I know security training for

253
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:24,149
compliance think that's one benefit of
PCI trying to think of some others

254
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:30,820
ok but seriously we have a really cool
compliance team and we try to make the

255
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,679
annual training phone right we don't
want to I know training in the same this

256
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,370
year as it was last year and how we do
this as we take a story approach so we

257
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,389
talked extensively about some of our
feelings which if you play the game you

258
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,130
have witnessed so sorry about that but
they provide really good awareness

259
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:53,410
training and we're constantly taken for
bike and we're constantly changing and

260
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,830
if you're not really comfortable to sit
back and you're probably in the wrong

261
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:02,759
company you need a really thick skin so

262
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:15,449
strength and we've not on the OPSEC
works Kris can everyone see this little

263
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:24,339
card says the definition of security
code so this is a developer and

264
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:31,120
engineers kind of work area

265
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,719
I have a couple copies of these or
anyone wants to see them I can give them

266
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,020
to you but I can show them afterwards
this is a definition of secure coat this

267
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,980
isn't something that we came up with
ourselves we actually sat down with

268
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,800
developers like hey what do you want to
know what do you need to know and we

269
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,899
actually generated through the content
and it's proved extraordinarily

270
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:59,190
successful services like version one and
we are sales actually think of this as

271
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:06,280
code version 2 and it's gonna be version
control and things like that but like

272
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,270
this has been really awesome as a huge
success one of the things from an

273
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:15,360
outside perspective there was a good
success was too many of practice so when

274
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,969
you do i dial type stuff we talked about
community of practice us like a

275
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,530
discipline to everyone who has the same
interests right to think of like a

276
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,910
network engineer or think of like I
don't know a good program or something

277
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,530
like they might have their own
communities of practice we created an

278
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,290
upset community of practice across right
and we did presentations and the success

279
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:40,590
with the mail on this like the mailing
list was phenomenal because we actually

280
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,280
saw developers and certain other
developers and telling them how to do

281
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,510
input validation code and things like
that but what actually failed was the

282
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,910
the presentations actually meet me docks
and the reason that failed was because

283
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,550
it was like preaching to the choir right
like to echo echo chamber so she wanna

284
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,500
learn about sex you're probably already
interested in a second then you're going

285
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,600
to turn up and we ended up counsel in it
and what we do now is we actually go out

286
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,030
to their community of practice is right
to actually go to the web teams

287
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,129
community practice regarding the
coatings community of practice to go to

288
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,750
the Big Data teams community of practice
and we present about security so

289
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,820
embedded security in their community of
practices rather than doing a security

290
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,509
community practice one other thing that

291
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:31,049
surprisingly didn't didn't work for us
was we wanted to do

292
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:35,158
OPSEC training so paid a lot of money
for an industry after an industry expert

293
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:41,009
he's also a huge gamer so it's great
culture fit and he did train and we

294
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:44,899
thought it was like awesome and it
turned out that we had like thirty forty

295
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:47,158
percent attendance from our engineers

296
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:51,629
what happened and again it was that the
whole echo chamber type thing but it was

297
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:57,509
also the fact that it wasn't a
presentation by a writer you know we

298
00:26:57,509 --> 00:27:02,119
didn't sit down and actually go hey
engineer exploit you need to know and I

299
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:05,389
was like a huge lesson for us so what
we're actually doing now is we're doing

300
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:09,498
her own training and again it's all very
uncontrolled and we actually have teams

301
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:14,399
helping us with a better and things like
that again goes back to the outreach

302
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:24,418
caused by knowing your audience listen
to what your audience actually wants so

303
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:28,949
another way that we've we've raised the
winner certain outreaches security week

304
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:32,369
so we can install this from Facebook

305
00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:39,779
probably in Pristina sorry ted and we
also want to do as well as security week

306
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:44,379
is when one or two give like a reward to
someone he does something that's good

307
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:48,908
from a security aspect right so I could
be hey I got a phishing email to tell

308
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:53,369
the security team and then they tell
their team or it could be someone who

309
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:58,589
discovers a vulnerability in a labor tea
and then commits the code back to the

310
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:02,549
open source library and tells everyone
in engineering and it's absolutely

311
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:07,879
phenomenal how successful this was like
people just love t-shirts especially

312
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:16,139
ones with big monsters and this was
really really awesome I kinda wish that

313
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:21,279
we realized that earlier but it was very
important to celebrate success the

314
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,639
security week was a good challenge and
it helped bring security to the

315
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,158
engineers

316
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,520
the whole of Ryan but we didn't realize
was how impacting it would be on

317
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,740
on local riders in terms of like it
draws them away from you know

318
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,350
contributing to the product are
contributing to their solutions so if

319
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,060
you do a security weak just just bear
that in mind

320
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:53,830
be cognizant of hey there's probably
other work that's going on at that time

321
00:28:53,830 --> 00:29:00,039
so within engineering and more
specifically like how did we do we move

322
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:07,330
away and trade alignment for terms of
like bill in a secure office during red

323
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,168
team in events during instant response
you know enabling security to monitor

324
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,010
your infrastructure so we actually have
a concept called request for comments

325
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:26,559
which is based on their request for
comments of the Sorry Sorry which is

326
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:33,730
based on the ATF and this is actually
been really successful its credit

327
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,769
alignment across engineering which I
think about her 17 offices globally

328
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:41,960
2000 riders she got different time zones
different languages different cultures

329
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:48,059
and it's it's been really kind of
amazing and homeland watch talk about

330
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:52,470
some examples and how we used an
engineer and requests for comments

331
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:59,179
process to embed security so the first
one is red team I really just wanted to

332
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:02,149
include this image because I think it's
kind of cool reminds me of Rainbow Six

333
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:10,418
but this is where we actually codify how
did you read him exercises and we've had

334
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:16,649
mixed success with this this has been
really interesting because it's actually

335
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:22,949
shown as high-tech screws are many years
later right so I read team is

336
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,139
essentially codified based on things
like Kelly Lenox and then a whole

337
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:32,219
process for the Red Team person to
follow and it worked really well on all

338
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,240
our new infrastructure that was built in
the last year to two years but anything

339
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,419
built for 25 years ago the process
actually just failed and when we created

340
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:45,360
the IRC and then we modified and took a
lineman Tony no one actually spotted

341
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,090
this until we actually went to do it and
then I just completely fell apart so it

342
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:57,049
was really interesting and for me it
really brought home how important it is

343
00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:01,639
not to take those shortcuts right to
deliver that quick term solution is a

344
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:02,300
kind of

345
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:09,580
indiscreet us and this is like the
biggest RFC that we did from a security

346
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:17,340
perspective so I talked about their 17
offices so remember that in dryer the

347
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,110
goal is to localize the game you know to
enhance their experience to be there

348
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:27,949
focused right so you remember the
picture 17 offices created one of those

349
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:33,040
secure right because you have a business
person essentially who wants the office

350
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,930
built as quickly as possible so he or
she can reach the player right and

351
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,300
what's one of the impediments in
building at office quickly typically

352
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:46,300
security but for us it is very important
to agree a standard and also to get that

353
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:52,290
visibility and eyeliner on the concept
of a secure office worldwide so this

354
00:31:52,290 --> 00:32:00,040
document is about 140 145 lines of
pseudo code 850 lines of comments so we

355
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:06,940
started with an RFC which we were like
hey this is like 80% security this is

356
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,320
probably a hundred percent security
because I was being security

357
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,750
professionals are biased totally on
security and their developers and

358
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,750
engineers and riders like a this will
stop me doing my job and an end up we

359
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:25,240
moved from 12 percent security but
probably 0% alignment to really like 80%

360
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,220
security and 100% alignment

361
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,490
points really important it's like if you
don't get higher percent alignment

362
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,710
you're not going to be able to drive
security forward you not going to be

363
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:40,360
able to build a security program so I we
take that sort of code and make it into

364
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:47,929
code automated we don't get in the way
remember so again

365
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:53,700
JSON think someone orders on the
beautiful quite nice but now we can

366
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,120
actually do is we can actually go hey
there's a new engineer he's in this

367
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,639
office is the office secure right to
comply with the IRC and I was like yeah

368
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,480
it does cool he can have access to code
if it's not then he or she can't have

369
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,360
access to coat so i got really excited
when we took it to the stage but again

370
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,320
as probably slightly nerdy but it's
pretty cool to see concept of a secure

371
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:29,470
office in JSON far ok so come back to
the original side we talked about three

372
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:38,240
different things socializing alignment
and then visibility

373
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:48,540
with three types of infrastructure one
is the cloud based infrastructure is

374
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,389
everyone has to be in the cloud and
skill and then we've got like our our

375
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,860
game infrastructure and then we've got
our corporate infrastructure and the

376
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,949
challenge is how do we get it

377
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,610
visibility into each of those three
infrastructures because there's no one

378
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:08,429
to content provided all right and the
challenge with with game infrastructure

379
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:14,379
which is more specific to the US but
also to like visibility is if you're

380
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:20,379
playing a game and you're not doing very
well if you don't need a server what

381
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:25,159
you'll probably do is like start
brightening job like like like like my

382
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:30,149
internet connections down you know as
opposed to I'm sure I'm sure I can click

383
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:35,129
quick enough because every millisecond
counts right so every time we put a

384
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:39,379
solution and we have to think about that
so it's not it's not actually about

385
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:46,960
Ireland latency to the service it's
actually about not affecting the service

386
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,240
in a consistent manner so basically when
you play an online game you'll see

387
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,270
you're playing time and that could be
like 40 milliseconds right but if that

388
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,460
varies the not so horrible player
experience so again come back to main

389
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,359
player focused on being unconscious of
their experience though is the type of

390
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,569
things we have to think so

391
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:15,010
typically the last minute filers the
best tool for the job so these are the

392
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,760
type of things that we've used to write
so we will go proprietary whenever we

393
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,630
have to we typically don't like it but
sometimes a proprietary solution is the

394
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,090
way to go

395
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:31,170
a really big proponents of open source
security monkey security onion and the

396
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:37,250
upset guys regular have orgasms about
this till I don't really get it but it's

397
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:42,670
cool I know but we also try to do is we
we build their own tools right so these

398
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,010
are tools that we will eventually open
source because giving back to the

399
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,780
community is a huge thing for us and
it's something that we're very conscious

400
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:58,240
that we need to do tomorrow that we want
to follow and that's really the Netflix

401
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,419
model huge fans of my Netflix go and do
things so this is a screenshot of

402
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:13,490
basically our AWS infrastructure so you
can see that we have just on their take

403
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,859
these two figures together these
instances we have these are the

404
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,870
instances that are stopped and use this
as a percentage of public IP we've

405
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:28,520
obviously got a bit of work to do with
our engineers who have you know the lead

406
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,370
in instances right but the benefit of
this is we now have visibility we have

407
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,650
now written until and children hey your
security posture or your performance

408
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:46,740
posture isn't as good as as you think it
was this is price on flask my sequel and

409
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,339
then if you remember the IRC stuff that
we talked about down here we have an r/c

410
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,760
that actually covers hey if you create
infrastructure and AWS you need to

411
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:05,890
target anyone not familiar with Tiger
and it'll be less so from an instant

412
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,770
response perspective Tiger is really
useful to tell you typically who owns

413
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:15,150
the incident and what the purpose of the
instance is right so we now can actually

414
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,800
going click this button and go hey who
is in compliance with the IRC

415
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,170
and then give that information and if
you think back to the incident we had

416
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,240
two years ago we didn't have that
visibility so what we're doing all this

417
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,529
really cool stuff in a WSN right now
until their reasoning tools that other

418
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:38,070
people have written and released to the
world and decided to release this

419
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:45,610
yesterday kind of pissed me off but this
is like Amazon's very generic security

420
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,510
monkey confirming a monkey on fire

421
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,880
little bit of our audit ill but I
haven't really played with it yet but

422
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,880
it's something that will obviously look
out but it doesn't I don't think

423
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:04,000
initially but the point is here he got
to be prepared for something else being

424
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,530
released it might be better right on a
taxi ok to stop development of your own

425
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:13,030
thing if something else is better again
going back to the best till and then the

426
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,930
final bit of visibility is like we are
only a security team of like 15

427
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:22,940
engineers are so we can't see everything
so we we come up with their own money

428
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:29,150
program and it was private and initially
it was really successful primarily at

429
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:36,080
the start it was a game so by that we
mean bugs die fighting this combination

430
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,049
of cheese then I can spam

431
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:45,820
spells and I don't lose manner I don't
get charged for it essentially run and

432
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:52,160
then last november we did like a public
beta so to speak and it's been very

433
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,020
successful at the start it was a huge
impact and a lesson there was the

434
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,370
feeling was that we probably released
before we were ready to leave the

435
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:05,230
workload head is really hard if you
worked on the OPSEC team like seventy

436
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,160
percent of your Sprint was doing both
bonnie wright so that's now down 15

437
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:15,390
percent which is three weekly poll by
any means your own tools and trying to

438
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,900
automate as much as possible

439
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,710
the key thing with programming as well
before I show either till you have to be

440
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,600
grateful always be grateful to the
researcher because they've taken the

441
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,580
time to find him guilty

442
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,290
explain it to you and then to take that
to the next level is sometimes the

443
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,520
researcher doesn't struggle technically
but it's just struggling with

444
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:43,720
communication right or maturity or even
language so take the time to work with

445
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,169
researcher

446
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:49,360
if you do this you can actually move
someone is a researcher from like low to

447
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:55,070
mid level up to like your top five or
top 10% like we have seen not only talk

448
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:59,360
to other companies wrong book by me and
they're saying that as well just always

449
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:05,300
bear bear in mind the researcher and
this is the till I don't know how well

450
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:11,590
this comes up but literally another
flask price on and for some reason our

451
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:20,150
intern decided to write this from Maria
sure it works and this was an intern

452
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,750
project over the summer and literally
what this does is with our bug bunny

453
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:31,310
work with Hawker run so how can one or
more crowd and said Atkins like top

454
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:36,290
three-point bonding companies but we
were struggling with his like how do we

455
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:40,490
present the park by Anita to be
meaningful to me engineers right to

456
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:46,250
actually taken to things like risk how
do we do a better job of protecting it

457
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:50,760
how do we do a better job of tracking it
and again we fell back to we need to

458
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,300
develop our own until to linking
information with Kara because we used

459
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:03,600
era for instance problem management
tracking of issues so once we did we saw

460
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:13,009
like huge increasing involvement and
contribution from developers

461
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:19,430
ok we're glad to have this is the final
section right so put on a lot of work

462
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:25,129
she can go hey we're finished the final
boss but really we just see this is the

463
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:32,210
beginning like we've improved a lot but
with a lot more to the biggest challenge

464
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,990
for me is like I'm a bit of a
perfectionist as several people on the

465
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:42,750
team are few people smiling so getting
all that's true and I'm accompanied her

466
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:47,740
finisher right I like to do everything I
like to complete it but you have to bear

467
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,680
in mind if you're gonna make changes to
your security DNA and they're going to

468
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,259
raise that bar you gotta let some things
go right you can't do all the things but

469
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,250
you need to be there to meet the
challenge continued rise to it and more

470
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:10,640
importantly support your team and your
colleagues and raising security type of

471
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,960
features that are kind of looking out
and working on is higher and higher end

472
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,110
is impossible it's really hard and a
text up far too much of my time

473
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:24,980
sometimes but the feeling when you get
that one higher the tax that the awesome

474
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,350
is amazing because you are a lot of
people in engineering talking about a 10

475
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:34,720
X 10 X is probably an exaggeration but
when you get someone that can you know

476
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,560
be autonomous

477
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,820
often not shit out and you don't have to
worry about them like that's phenomenal

478
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,610
they raised the bar more than anyone
else

479
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:48,090
those are the type of people that you
need to pay too much they should never

480
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:52,490
be leaving because of money they should
always be looked after you know so

481
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:58,209
higher in massively important standards
and verify that's touching on things

482
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,110
like the RC's touching on things like
the awareness training right but then

483
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:06,230
verify that those things have been
happening so things like red intestine

484
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,890
we need to get better out you still want
to do what we need to do it differently

485
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,890
than typically it's been done the
industry we need to create pills but we

486
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:18,850
need to be conscious that those tools
being best of breed right sometimes

487
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:25,490
proprietary is the right way to do it

488
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:39,540
if you reach your not gonna raises
security program right you're not gonna

489
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,279
prove it and the most important things
that we've done is we've tried to talk

490
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,030
in the language of the developers tried
to talk the language of the other riders

491
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:54,369
we have gone and visited other companies
have gone to Silicon Valley talk to

492
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:57,930
people who solves a lot of problems that
we're trying to solve we're trying to

493
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:03,339
build you know a security around and
become the conferences like this we are

494
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:09,400
constantly seeing ourselves as a support
organization and if we don't if we don't

495
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,380
talk about our challenges are how we've
solved them we will never actually

496
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:22,440
improve right we'll never learned so I
can't really I guess over-emphasize you

497
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,119
know the importance of outreach we want
to ensure that security is in our DNA in

498
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:33,770
our products so taken aback to the
previously talked about higher end one

499
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:41,040
of the things we did was we actually
create an infrastructure and AWS what

500
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:48,000
we've noticed with higher end is we
typically have we also have liked a

501
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,990
challenge

502
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:55,169
terms of differentiating between
knowledge and practical knowledge so we

503
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:01,320
build infrastructure so we could tell
people this is an example of success but

504
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,000
it's also a failure because we've been
able to build infrastructure we just

505
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,420
haven't turned it into something useful

506
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,740
this is a very real example of how we're
trying to think about hiring in a

507
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:17,459
slightly different way and to ensure
that we get better higher and also

508
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,030
provide a better hiring

509
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:23,690
experience the candidates and where we
did this was a thing called Thunderdome

510
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:30,330
has anyone heard from there

511
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:38,060
too thanks for listening to Thunder dome
is like our own internal microphone

512
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,910
which we do twice a year and this is
literally were engineers artists finance

513
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:48,140
people anyone can I come along and spent
like three days it was originally one

514
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:53,819
day and was 24 are swapping with people
weren't actually sleep for about 36 send

515
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,680
productivity was like damaged for a week
so let me try to spread it out over

516
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:05,410
three days and you know I guess smaller
stocks of the people get rest you can

517
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:09,490
learn more about this city gone to
Thunderdome the rankings are calm we

518
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:16,040
have a seven-minute video about our
culture about what we do and I wanted to

519
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,770
include in this but in the time both
really killing recommend checking it out

520
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:28,800
see I just just bring it home I

521
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,440
you don't want to run to stay still and
if you think about it earlier we were

522
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,470
doing a lot of firefighting we were
doing a lot of work and we do not a good

523
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:40,500
work but when taxi progressing so you
want to become part of the organization

524
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,700
not separate so a really good book that
talks about this is the phoenix project

525
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,430
where talks about not operate in
isolation and always being there to

526
00:46:50,430 --> 00:47:08,020
support when I was kid us by reaching
out to really important to be versatile

527
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:14,920
and adapt to the situation and for us
one of the things that were actually now

528
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:23,410
going to do is we're going to change how
we are structured as an organization has

529
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:29,109
anyone ever done like stakeholder
mapping as a security team actually sat

530
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:36,780
down and gone who are my stakeholders so
the question and I would have liked how

531
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,640
do you actually know if you're
delivering what you should be delivered

532
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,830
right so we've actually sat down and
said these are our stakeholders these

533
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,870
are the ones that are power these are
the ones that you want to influence

534
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:50,830
right season one that we need to work
really closely with these the ones that

535
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:57,100
we just need to check in with every few
months so if you don't know how your

536
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,740
stakeholders are how can you engage how
can you outline how can you actually

537
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:06,649
support your organization run and when
she do those things then you can

538
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:12,020
actually learn hey we were like way off
we need to iterate RA we were doing a

539
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:16,750
good job we need to iterate just a
little bit so remember your audience is

540
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,930
massively important and one of the
things that we're doing now is Roxy

541
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:25,629
restructuring our team so we have to
kind of audiences speak one game player

542
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:31,180
one being riser unlike most security
teams we were kind of organized along

543
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:36,009
site disciplines to think of like upset
like network security system security

544
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,800
right so

545
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,330
the problem there is that they have
multiple audiences right they don't just

546
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:47,450
have one thing you're trying to fix
system problems for people who are on

547
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:53,089
the corporate side are people who are on
our site and as a result you're not

548
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:58,170
really delivering a product security in
the product that you need to deliver so

549
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,780
what we're doing is we're gonna split
one side of the team is going to be

550
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:07,860
focused on players they always going to
be so focused on writer and I think

551
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:12,080
that's going to help us all that and
that's a perfect example of iteration

552
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:17,420
and also be prepared to fail you're not
prepared to fail how you ever gonna

553
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:25,510
learned so yeah keep on alignment
remember your audience and you're there

554
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,690
to support not the other way around

555
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:39,790
type is it

556
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:48,460
i really appreciate your emphasis on the
importance of hiring and I like the

557
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:56,770
approach with you didn't go too deep
into technical screening but it looks

558
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:05,110
pretty solid in terms of getting that
say not whatever like star kind of

559
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:10,600
person that you want to meet your not
only kind of trying to filter for

560
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,610
technical skills but also for character
something that's more ephemeral leg is

561
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:21,350
the first in a self-starter what's the
work ethic what's their personality do

562
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:24,170
you have to say something to hear you
scream for that kind of inequalities

563
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:30,750
yeah I guess I try to hire people I
don't have the money to have to manage

564
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:37,540
them dan you know it's not going to help
me help the team romped to a lot of the

565
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:42,259
questions that we ask open-ended
questions I don't expect people to get a

566
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:48,470
hundred percent when they do the first
green like we can do 1314 interviews so

567
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,459
those type of things pretty much come
through so what do you like a cordless

568
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,430
phone screens and then what we want to
do is what you want to do practical

569
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:03,879
screen but we haven't hit up our area
and then the on sites typically like six

570
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,370
or seven hours and people focus on
companies so things like operation

571
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:13,859
things like communication there be like
to interview subject matter expert and

572
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:19,060
then everyone like culture values and
people can go to other companies that

573
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:24,070
are encouraged not to do any training
which helps people scream for those

574
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:30,130
competencies the questions I asked her
typically open-ended questions and again

575
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,580
not a hundred percent so what if we
often do is like we will engage with

576
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,319
people who are following up and going
hey here she didn't get this thing right

577
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:44,660
checking on this how did they do in
terms of like you know a subsequent

578
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,020
interview here two weeks later you know
screen for that

579
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:52,600
right or screen for that on the on site
after the phone screen that's kind of

580
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,770
like self-starter look for things like
did you contribute to open source

581
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:04,180
communities what have you done to learn
about the game the product like some

582
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:08,129
people have actually turned up on
presented security report on how

583
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:12,720
insecure or networking protocol was more
like things that we did right so it's

584
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,529
like two people do things that are
bothering beyond that I haven't asked

585
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:23,480
him to do as they're not a gamer or
maybe they're a lot steamer have they

586
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,920
tried to play the game 1 of the learned
about the game and then the other

587
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,660
interviews like if they don't know much
about the game

588
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,220
encouraged him to learn and then in a
subsequent interview like check for

589
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,870
those type of things but it's one of
those things that's quite hard to you

590
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:46,740
know drill into similar to like thinks
is another thing but for ethics its

591
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:52,029
muscle important to us more than any
other team probably and how do I was

592
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:56,910
like Austin something that they probably
won't know and see if they lie a lie

593
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:03,830
then it's not really could sign of
ethics are you know it's there's no real

594
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:09,130
signs to interview like it's it's really
more of an art and it's also about

595
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,570
establishing very strong interviewers so
people who you can trust me know the

596
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:19,020
right things but like what has he done
in the open source community what do you

597
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,230
know about riot

598
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:24,800
like presentations today I don't learn
like did they go on to Game Developer

599
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,300
vault and go hey I want to know but
actually quite know what type of

600
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:35,010
questions do they ask so I know one guy
that walks in like okay so this is gonna

601
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:40,500
be 60 minutes if you ask me questions
and don't ask me stupid questions and

602
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:47,210
goes ok try try again try again I'm
gonna fit

603
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:51,830
doesn't really ask any questions

604
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:55,319
different people have different
techniques but we put a strong panel

605
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:03,820
together as well and ensure that we
communicate question well just when you

606
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,359
talk about having like trying to put
together a strong panel do you track

607
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,640
metrics for interviewers like this
person interviewed these people and

608
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,118
overtime their outcomes were explained
see cuz it seems like that to take it to

609
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,609
the next level

610
00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:24,339
yeah if if you read a book on work rules
for Google

611
00:54:24,339 --> 00:54:31,880
they do something similar to that we
haven't got level but we do know to

612
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:37,640
people's feedback how people are thumbs
up or thumbs up and then sooner or later

613
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:46,129
you might find yourself off pommel so
it's like a thumbs up this person you

614
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,599
might get another chance but then you're
probably off the panel if you don't

615
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,300
actually provide feedback

616
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:57,440
one of the key facets of riders feedback
and that works to put twice and if

617
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,820
you're not providing feedback can you
not invite you so you'll get coaching

618
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,820
and feedback yourself and how to improve
so yeah it's not it's not as much of the

619
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:19,890
sciences is a Google but it's probably
get them that way

620
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:38,839
so from the very beginning to do it
differently and make it easier on myself

621
00:55:38,839 --> 00:56:07,549
I think I would probably trying I think
I think I do try to get the alignment

622
00:56:07,549 --> 00:56:17,430
earlier I kind of realized he now like
when I look at how I do in RFC versus

623
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:23,779
then it's already taper down so what I
didn't do then was I didn't reach out as

624
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:27,509
much so I definitely try and reach out
more

625
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:34,519
build relationships make sense which
will help me learn about the challenges

626
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:41,609
that each team has but also the people
who influence in order to get things

627
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:52,900
moving to make sense since I think one
thing I do is I probably

628
00:56:52,900 --> 00:57:00,940
be less afraid of standing up and making
my point so I have a tendency to shoot

629
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:08,110
from the hip as you may or may not know
but I need to be more forceful that

630
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:12,660
makes sense so I think I need to be more
forceful but in a more constructive

631
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:17,339
fashion and I not have realized that but
I wish I realized that two years ago

632
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:22,300
because sometimes there comes a point
that was 21 alignment and you want to

633
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:28,460
keep the creativity and innovation you
have to be prepared to Kabul ship dan

634
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:36,220
the other thing I wish I had done sooner
but I only did last week was we've got a

635
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:41,819
really cool vulnerability in her book by
any program that sound like sitting

636
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,500
watching Wales v England and being Irish
I'm like delighted right cause will

637
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:51,070
score try you know ten minutes to go and
I'm getting excited now my phone goes

638
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:57,180
and I was like on call and who started
getting texts from my lady and so he

639
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:02,270
probably 10 like keno get online really
soon I checked the vulnerability ability

640
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:08,009
and I was like shit I was able to track
down to the very second 10 months ago

641
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:17,490
when the vulnerability started show what
I wish I had done was like builders

642
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:24,529
visibility tools are there in a forceful
fashion but more importantly we fixed

643
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:29,690
the issue and closed it off I actually
wrote up the incident report and

644
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:33,890
yesterday I published it on your local
internet for everyone in the company of

645
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:41,799
you and who wishes to before yesterday
because the key thing for me when I talk

646
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,090
a lot about visibility is you
automatically think about visibility

647
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:49,960
into the infrastructure so to get
alignment I had a lot of one-on-ones

648
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,240
Elena talk to people and things like
that and do that influence

649
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,200
but what I realized is like we as a
security community or skip security team

650
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,939
didn't actually communicate how bad some
ship was right so the positive data base

651
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:09,410
loss I was meeting people who are
responsible for developing our store so

652
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:14,359
everyone knows that our stores in PHP
see it kinda think that they would be an

653
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:18,119
important people to like recharged from
an upset perspective ago hey here's an

654
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:22,860
example of ship gone wrong gone really
odd posture database gone but that

655
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,220
actually didn't happen to a security
team are failing on the communication of

656
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:31,060
actually providing some realistic
descriptions of like what can happen

657
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:38,110
when couples are so that would be the
key point I wish I our report and

658
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:45,200
publicized it sooner

659
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:52,390
question so how do you manage security
like to use automated tools or the

660
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:59,410
European used before code is pushed
repository how does it work

661
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:04,690
series a couple of different
repositories typically you know the ones

662
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:13,740
that are most popular and what we'll do
is the code has to be approached by an

663
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:20,689
engineer but it also has to be sorry
there is a question that has to be

664
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:26,960
approved by someone going in there is
ultimately owner of Product Owner of our

665
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,010
source code so League of Legends source
code and then there's like different

666
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:34,510
branches and this is all done through
RFC as well we actually have an artsy on

667
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:40,420
code ownership I dot essentially means
that someone is ultimately the owner of

668
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:46,060
every single line of code so it's not
owner that's responsible for that being

669
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:51,940
committed so to speak and it's it's done
three typical you know products that you

670
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:56,340
can probably guess but what was done
from an upset perspective is we've

671
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:02,740
written checklists for the security code
card and things like that and we

672
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:08,540
actively encouraging teams to reach out
and do you know secure go down and get

673
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:12,509
their stuff you know broken and tested
and things like that and one of the big

674
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:16,840
benefits in order to be able to do that
is we took the decision to visit local

675
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:21,190
offices so if you remember the slide was
like 17 offices each one of those

676
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:26,369
officers can potentially write code for
sure to repo and they're not code goes

677
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:31,210
to a player or whatever so we had like
one officer was like you know me of

678
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:35,180
finding survivors like and random German
hosting companies and stuff like that

679
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:44,410
had port 3389 open Microsoft sequel open
had like 445 139 and 135 and stuff like

680
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,368
that you're like what

681
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:51,520
and now that team has actually gone the
other way and all the reports are like

682
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:57,740
minor vulnerabilities and we actually
found that it wasn't so much three like

683
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:03,080
checking stuff being committed to their
office spending time with them

684
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,560
explaining things to them and they're
pretty smart and typically they're

685
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,250
smarter than us in the actual subject
matter expert and then the only actual

686
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,900
decision and then they have their own
process internally in the engineering

687
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:22,680
team terms of how cold is pushed
committed verified things I did try

688
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:30,220
Coverity but it didn't really work it's
not really due to the product of social

689
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:34,720
but it was more detail how the teams
worked and then what was done as well as

690
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:40,759
we're acting right knee extensions that
things like burp commit now back to the

691
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:46,119
community and share not locally first
engineering teams and blogging about and

692
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:54,330
stuff

693
01:02:54,330 --> 01:03:00,830
just kind of following on what you're
saying about communicating with the

694
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:05,150
non-security focused teams what sort of
effect would you say the incidents had

695
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:08,870
with them that it can make themselves
and go right we need to fix this

696
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:12,549
want to be involved you want to engage
with the security teams are largely

697
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:26,400
ignored which one was just any of the
instant you talk

698
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,029
well the thing with like the leaks in
the red karma is that are typically

699
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:35,510
hurts hurts the team is they've worked
very long you know something that's like

700
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:40,450
typically kept under wraps so that type
of fact definitely encouraging

701
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:46,509
encourages them to reach out when every
blog about stuff people totally reach

702
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:53,539
out the password database one I thought
more teams would have reached out that's

703
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:57,920
where we soaked in terms of
communicating make people realize how

704
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,839
bad the effect was the awareness
training is really good cause we just

705
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:08,680
get like people going hey I got trashed
or I got this happens all the time we've

706
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,359
actually had red team exercises fail
because people like walking up toward

707
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:15,990
asking I think this is a fishing which
is awesome

708
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:20,520
means our wireless is working so fishing
was like people are inherently part

709
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:26,900
we've had like some really awesome
personal attacks come in and done really

710
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:35,079
well from the awareness training from
kind of seems to stick with people that

711
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:41,500
the US one because people will be on
communities you know I could really game

712
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,380
or so there are like our forums and
things like that are there might be

713
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:50,420
playing a game and like again going back
to amateur dislike hi I'm going to fuck

714
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:54,160
indeed I'll show you cuz I'm like
seventeen and have nothing better to do

715
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,808
our shit like that and we get
screenshots of those I'm gonna like a

716
01:04:57,809 --> 01:05:03,329
lot of those isolated devices and trust
in cuz it's really easy to deal with

717
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:09,789
stuff it's just really hard to protect
it like a Windows program has been

718
01:05:09,789 --> 01:05:13,940
really successful and whenever we we
actually actively reach out try to put

719
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:19,180
things in non-security language
encourages others to reach out to one of

720
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:25,430
the things that we started doing as well
as like vendor certification

721
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:29,368
that's because anyone tried can install
whatever they wanted to be innovative

722
01:05:29,369 --> 01:05:33,609
creative moves fast all that stuff so we
actually be logged about the vendor

723
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:37,299
certification and things like that I
would actually found that people are

724
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:43,069
reaching out to us because it again it
goes back to blogging documentation make

725
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:51,250
an invisible is a searchable ok so I'm
aware that the lunches coming up now so

726
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:56,380
there are still a lot of questions going
on so I would just say already get

727
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:04,320
marker of applause

728
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:09,840
so I am inclined to continue with the
question around however the people that

729
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:20,590
want to go for dinner please try to do
it quietly hi I just got a small

730
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:27,500
question for friends and make it to the
suites to favorites riled employees or

731
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:42,080
or person I don't have any favorite ok
so you example to you so so so months

732
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:47,770
ago the Tropico three popular are you
still seeing a lot of instances of this

733
01:06:47,770 --> 01:07:01,560
type of program or decline is there is
the camera is the recording of now the

734
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:19,299
recordings are fake and talk about this

735
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:25,130
but for details if you think about when
you're playing a game right latency is

736
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:29,470
really important but I touched upon the
jitter thanked so if you think about us

737
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:36,540
services like electric Arbor cloud cover
sign stuff it's really easy to go how

738
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,840
I'm going to put this in front of my
website but the game isn't a brochure

739
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:47,560
site it's not like you know I gallons
either something so basic pH DPS and you

740
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:55,070
can't use any cast right because you
need to be close to the servers so you

741
01:07:55,070 --> 01:08:01,280
just need a shit ton capacity and need
money and if you're like Facebook Google

742
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:11,810
Amazon gonna work so if you actually if
you google I think any and a server root

743
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:21,120
macdill see some of the stuff that we've
done not specifically to stop the US to

744
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:26,000
stop the noise but also take a closer to
the player to enhance oppler experience

745
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,720
so if everyone's familiar with Netflix
and how they actually write ISPs has

746
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,500
anyone seen like Netflix rank I speech
right and go to page on Netflix's these

747
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:41,290
are the best ice piece for watching
Netflix what we've done is essentially

748
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:46,990
built around pop infrastructure so we're
going closer to that which means that we

749
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:51,960
don't have transit providers in our way
you know she'll go from your local ISP

750
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,509
and then boom dies he could be peering
with riot

751
01:08:55,509 --> 01:09:03,109
could be like ISP one transit provider
directly to riot right so in in north in

752
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:14,770
Europe it's our game servers for West
are are in Amsterdam he is basically

753
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:21,380
Frankfurt and Amsterdam but then we've
also created pops so points of presence

754
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:29,339
so it's going to be like London Vienna
possibly Stockholm Madrid Paris right so

755
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:30,600
if you're in those countries

756
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,890
a quicker response but the benefit of
that is that your bills and a

757
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:39,520
distributed network which means you're
able to distribute or two things that

758
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,630
you need a few things you need a team of
techies new people are gonna work really

759
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:49,390
hard you need to be able to like build
relationships with the various providers

760
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:58,370
and then you need money money helps but
it's not just about money and it's not

761
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:03,739
just about preventing the US it's about
building like that kind of huge

762
01:10:03,739 --> 01:10:07,410
infrastructure which is like our version
of anycast

763
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:11,960
when we were getting the 400 cake and 2
p.m. application talks I talked to some

764
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,710
really well-known internet companies and
they were like oh yeah we saw it as well

765
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:21,949
but basically swallowed it takes like a
blip

766
01:10:21,949 --> 01:10:29,530
pumping the water and I was like ok need
to get beer need to get more distributed

767
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:35,679
as ACL like source port block and
destination port blocking both on

768
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,309
filters are like toi people are kinda
early gonna go so far and the thing

769
01:10:40,309 --> 01:10:44,909
about GOI people are going as well as
you don't wanna damaged up their

770
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:49,940
experience either so dependent on
homogeneous your region is you can only

771
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:58,659
do so much that you can't just bought
China because it doesn't come from China

772
01:10:58,659 --> 01:11:08,209
and China's huge games so answer a
question I can talk about the job

773
01:11:08,209 --> 01:11:19,780
packing it in a few by coming back to
the point of presence distributed around

774
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:26,349
where you have approached the network
providers trying to force you into

775
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:40,990
agreements toward better quality of
service like Netflix and Comcast deal so

776
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:46,670
it's not like well with Netflix there
more or less trying to 2000 with do they

777
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:52,070
sell latency as well in that model I
don't think most providers are actually

778
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:57,530
know how to control the agency for a
gamer I don't think they can really

779
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:08,400
relate I haven't come across some of our
network engineers me but we talked a lot

780
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:13,460
about the project at school right direct
so she could like you can find more

781
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:32,660
information about it but we haven't come
across it I don't think any questions

782
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:37,610
so you stated that you use security
onion do you really do full packet

783
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:45,839
capture for the players and also your
office locations we don't use security

784
01:12:45,840 --> 01:13:00,610
infrastructure is not going to scale or
something like that but we do for packet

785
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:07,349
capture some parts of our network in
your game infrastructure like that the

786
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:13,200
full packet capture stuff is secure
office are see through the offices that

787
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:26,639
we've rolled I to do have a PC but
because it's it's inconsistent across

788
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,350
its inconsistent across different
infrastructures like what we usually try

789
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:40,470
to do is like three days and then after
that it's more so the meditator as

790
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:46,360
opposed to like the whole presentation
is not like hey I'm finished I cares

791
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,820
that end of your report

792
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:53,299
kinda like hey this is like the midterm
report these are the things that we've

793
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,720
done and like our goal is to you know
automate ourselves out of a job but

794
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:01,640
realistically we're never gonna do that
the security so they approached it with

795
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:06,550
taken as I try to build security into
DNA and make everyone aware of it and

796
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:11,240
help you know touching on like I R and
things like that we're never going to

797
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:21,050
have a security team that can do
everything for us

798
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:25,809
question about whether or not you get
involved in the design phase for

799
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:30,280
securing games in and feature sets
within the games that something that you

800
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:37,460
do typically sorry the security by
design and as in like lodging flaws in

801
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:41,770
the game that would allow people to take
advantage of the game that are much

802
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:52,849
harder to repeal later down the line
that's again soon now it would all go

803
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:58,619
through the IRC process so visible so
anything that you're gonna change are

804
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:03,369
fundamentally from a service or solution
replication aspect of it all be three

805
01:15:03,369 --> 01:15:09,759
Darcy so that's like wide open and we
are responsible ourselves for ensuring

806
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,679
that we keep up to date with ERC now if
something happens and we haven't

807
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:22,679
contributed someone will typically us
but we also need to understand the game

808
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:28,710
is written in C++ I don't really know
C++ I can do you like hello world that's

809
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:29,639
about it

810
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:36,159
upcycled ice kind of C++ but they don't
know to the degree of the SME don't make

811
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:43,079
sense we also have like 70 million
players right and a lot of them were

812
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:47,250
technical so if you think about it like
10 people that you meet the world's like

813
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:51,530
usually one of them is a douche bike so
we've probably have my induced by two

814
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:56,519
technical and their constant like you
know trying to echo on a break this you

815
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:02,130
know I want to better for competitive
advantage and things like that but we

816
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:06,989
actively have people reaching out to us
but when it comes down to like pure

817
01:16:06,989 --> 01:16:13,709
logic and that's like really a gameplay
you know engineer it's never going to

818
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:18,929
have that level of SME that are gonna
have so really again you can only

819
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:19,889
support to a certain degree
