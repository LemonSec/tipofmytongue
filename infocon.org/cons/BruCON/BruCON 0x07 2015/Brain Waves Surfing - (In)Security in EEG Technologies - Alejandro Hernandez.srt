1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:05,740
the presentations with atopic about
something I don't understand anything

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,930
about it are always going to be like the
most important ones in the most

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:15,530
interesting 100% something about it Ege
or Camino and electroencephalography in

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,939
a non-invasive method for the recording
and the study of electrical activity in

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,290
the brain thinking from the scalp now in
other words racing oils are used in many

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,210
different other ways many other ways
like in research and entertainment

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,719
purposes but doesn't your feedback

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,179
arts and their gaming but nowadays is
acknowledged as being adopted more and

9
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:41,719
more indifference and different
industries now our hunger will

10
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,769
demonstrate the couple of demo's and a
first approach to demonstrate is that eg

11
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:51,739
technologies are prone to common network
and application at thanks so very very

12
00:00:51,739 --> 00:01:02,568
very warm welcome to all and they're
good evening to everyone for subtle

13
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:07,270
thank you so much for being here for
your time for staying until the end I

14
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,830
know that many of you have had some
beers had dinner and i know that some

15
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,289
oxygen from your brain is going to your
stomach now so please save some of that

16
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:24,130
oxygen for here and well this
presentation I had the chance to show

17
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,880
this stuff in the air conditioner two
months ago in Las Vegas so I hope you

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,170
like it

19
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,730
about me I'm a consultant from the
security company are you active with a

20
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,480
different kind of consulting services
research I'm a ninja storm forcing

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,190
programming enforcing a have developed
some tools like the phone directory

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,789
total terror attacks which other friend
friends also I develop another

23
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,930
forcing to the represented in black had
arsenal was here for file formats

24
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,120
forcing

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,690
computer systems engineering background
they didn't know you need your signs for

26
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:11,620
to these research so this is a new topic
for me I've been doing this for the last

27
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,290
year from scratch but I think I
understand a little bit of these because

28
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,489
the human brain is very complex and the
technology is very interesting and I'm

29
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:32,000
from this beautiful country mexico so
yeah I'm going to talk about why this

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,350
research you might ask why range of YEG
why it's important what's that and I'm

31
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:45,630
really I will show you the basic stuff
about that they were signs 101 as well

32
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,859
as the insecurity aspect this is why we
are here

33
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:56,650
way these technologies insecure for me
so far I'll show you something if you

34
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:03,940
saw this movie johnny mnemonic nineties
miami is a killer reaps using his brain

35
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,829
as a storage device so if you're
expecting these this is not the target

36
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:17,850
looking for that I can tell you the
reason of these talked basically we we

37
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,609
taking about nowadays about information
security mobile security card security

38
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,270
and all that stuff what about our bodies
what about the information the date of

39
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:38,250
your bodies in the end of its data so
this technology eg is being adopted more

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,780
and more originally it became it began
in the medical industry but nowadays

41
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,830
many sick many research are being
adopting more and more and this for me

42
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,420
is very important because things years
ago

43
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,619
industrial networks is cable networks
nobody was talking about security about

44
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,709
that all the people was just worried
about that it works the computers are

45
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,989
connected to the to the industrial plant
and it works

46
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:09,700
dangerous later nowadays group

47
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,780
talking about a lot of security
deficiencies there and I'm seeing

48
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,149
exactly the same things here especially
because we're adopting eg more and more

49
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:25,299
later so I think only stating that this
is the best moment to to put security

50
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,150
technologies to deal with security in
mind to implement their security

51
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,090
controls in there and of course brain
stuff is cool like in cyberpunk

52
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,070
literature in in case you know we see in
movies to this is something that

53
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,150
inspires me you know they play a little
bit with brain especially in recent

54
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:52,150
movies for that what I did was all I
knew was that there is some technology

55
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,489
measuring brain waves so I started to
learn a little bit of neuroscience so

56
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,680
for me to you this is no sales 101 is
very basic he's just five minutes from

57
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
here in her brain

58
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,780
we have different logs we have the
cortex different parts of the brain and

59
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:17,000
the brain there are millions of this
acceptable sales in Iran steps that we

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,110
know they share information between each
other so this information that they

61
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:30,160
share is basically electrical and
chemical signals a process for many

62
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,050
different things to sleep to move to
have this number to give a presentation

63
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:43,100
of broken many things and depending of
your mind state the signups activity

64
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,810
could be affected for example from a
normal behavior or even your own coffee

65
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:56,840
nor any other drug this activity behaves
differently right so this is world after

66
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,950
one month or something I learned that
the human brain is very complex if you

67
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,820
go to Google you'll find like thousands
and thousands of documents and

68
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,789
presentations on like a lot of the stuff
that i doing getting priced seriously

69
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,950
now moving on

70
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,580
to understand these technologies there
is a very big separation invasive

71
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,550
technologies in non-invasive technology
as you can see in the graph in basic

72
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:29,330
technologies means implanting a cheap in
the cortex like these soldiers are

73
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,550
getting the synapse activity even in a
more clear way easier is more reliable

74
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,820
but on the other hand if you put the
skull area and electrodes on your so

75
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:46,159
called this is a non-invasive method
it's prone to its plan to noise because

76
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,110
of the school but it's an easy way this
is a very clear example of an invasive

77
00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:00,100
brain computer interface basically this
researchers implementing the electrode

78
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,070
getting the signups activities so all
you have to do is to think like thinking

79
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,040
I want to meet with his arm immediately
there is a lot of research behind on

80
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,080
training behind to these put it works so
the result of this is a famous project

81
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,370
bring eight of these women using this
spring computer interface controlling

82
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:25,250
these mechanical arm on the other hand
on the purpose of this talk is to talk

83
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,310
about non invasive and non-invasive the
most used one the most famous wanna see

84
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:41,250
eg electroencephalography basically our
electrodes and it looks like this is the

85
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,410
representation over time of these
connections between your your new rules

86
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:52,270
so you can see different types different
and it has different meanings of course

87
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:59,950
but basically deceit is a representation
of your brain activity is very easy to

88
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:06,640
use all you have to do is to put
electrodes in the brain

89
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,860
I susceptible to noise

90
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,389
I really like this quote by these famous
0 signed John don't know the Naga I

91
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:22,090
don't know his name sorry the cooling
technologies are like trying to this

92
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:28,258
entire conversation a football stadium
from you know these globes so this is

93
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,349
the best analogy of her now because
there is a lot of noise to get

94
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,880
information from your brain to pass
through the school is is is is very hard

95
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:45,510
but still it works very small its
mystery Microboards and the main

96
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:54,029
frequencies are also between one and
then 30 hurts and every every way blame

97
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:59,880
have different meanings for example when
you are putting a tensions were your

98
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:07,610
focus your feet away far higher than
when you're sleeping they're different

99
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:14,850
methods to put the skull the electrodes
because I as i told me for different

100
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:22,620
regions from the brain has different
objectives so the signals are analog in

101
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,190
order to send them to a computer for
processing or storage place digital

102
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,540
conversion complete fires in between
filters etc

103
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:39,990
sampling stuff so this is a real EEG
recording every line is an electrode and

104
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,959
what the researchers who did talk to see
here they find different patterns they

105
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,768
have different artifact an artifact is
sunny winter is not related by the

106
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:55,300
directly to the brain for example an
artifact would be this waiting between

107
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,339
my body and the electrode or could be me
bringing my ice bank mice this could

108
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:08,360
affect the brain activity but it's not
strictly related I get this book which

109
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:33,790
is basically an atlas of EEG patterns

110
00:10:33,790 --> 00:11:14,150
commercial and consumer devices which
are these ones newer Skype mind wait it

111
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:20,930
I just got this one for 100 bucks on
amazon.com and this is the purpose of

112
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,689
this stock now it's easy to get these
devices and create some stuff this is

113
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,680
tough to create some research to do
different applications or you can do it

114
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,140
yourself open source software and
hardware now in the following his life's

115
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:43,430
I want you to put attention I want I
want you to put to be like a head like a

116
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,689
malicious attacker think in order uses
for the following its lights and think

117
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,060
all the different attacks in areas that
the attack vectors that you might you

118
00:11:52,060 --> 00:12:02,640
might find for example is the most used
use of each gene is for installing

119
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,220
different disorders like seizures
sleeping disorders people with

120
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:23,810
narcolepsy etcetera I will show you
quickly

121
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,000
software using the hospital as you can
see this is basically date and this is

122
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,260
the patient and the video is
synchronized with the EEG recordings you

123
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:51,200
can see his brain activity is going from
normal he's having a seizure now these

124
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,470
green things there are annotations by
the doctors to understand what's

125
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,400
happening exactly at what point he's
having a seizure exactly what brain

126
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,150
waves were going back right this is
what's happening

127
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:17,680
hospitals right now their recordings in
digital format sculptor

128
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:25,399
so this is the the research and clinical
use various people using these data are

129
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:31,920
putting into the clout to analyze them
to apply complex algorithm to be there

130
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:40,079
understand different different diseases
right there is people playing with

131
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,940
Arduino with some other electronic
boards to use this ed devices to control

132
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:53,279
any mechanical processes like this
mechanical ankle like this with an

133
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:00,430
Arduino Arduino board or brain to brain
injuries it used to be like science

134
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:04,890
fiction five years ago ten years ago but
now in the University of Washington they

135
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:10,720
are doing really cool stuff with brain
to brain research so basically there is

136
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,209
one guy in one side of the world using
the media buys they are getting his

137
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:22,310
brain waves they are passing through a
computer and the computer process it

138
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,329
because it and send it over the internet
on the other end there is another

139
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:34,810
computer receiving this information
including it and sending it to the MS MS

140
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,599
stands for transcranial magnetic
stimulator is a very complex device that

141
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,170
basically stimulate stimulate certain
part of your brain to do something so

142
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:53,410
the experiment basically was this this
guy was just thinking about pressing his

143
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,949
finger just thinking this information
went to the internet and she received it

144
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:05,680
here with this TMS thing and
unconsciously he just press the button

145
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,310
so basically the brain to brain
interface and they are doing it for many

146
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:19,119
different purposes I read I don't
remember in BBC Radio Times that it

147
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,070
could help

148
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:27,470
in hypothetical examples for let's say
that the pilot and co-pilot died so this

149
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:33,070
technology in a very long future I don't
know where when there could be a hamlet

150
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:38,350
that one of the flight attendants could
use so from the ground she would be

151
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,640
controlled by someone else brainwave
sounds crazy right what people doing it

152
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:49,930
now controlling stuff with brain waves
research on being controlling legal now

153
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:58,900
in Portugal controlling helicopters we
know passwords worries that we no secret

154
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:06,300
what about you see past your brain waves
hi biometric mechanism right its various

155
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,920
people working now in car about all the
URLs you can find all the by my sources

156
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,709
here

157
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:25,310
military use soldiers converting brain
waves into comments or during this news

158
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,670
scientists are using high-powered
passing lot of pictures to the soldiers

159
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,459
in the northern to identify threatening
scenarios so the soldiers reduce

160
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:41,560
thinking and they might think perhaps
behind at Rock Ariz bomb border is gone

161
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,579
and I don't know so all this information
including in brain waves are being used

162
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:54,830
for further research into battle for
your feedback for our creating music or

163
00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:01,360
in this case this is some water they're
taken to the to the trial so his lawyer

164
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:09,510
say they may need a brain scan of these
guys so Indian deg result could affect

165
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,640
the trial I don't know it could affect
the number of jerusalem briefs on I

166
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:23,709
don't know your gaming computer wayne's
used with brain waves new marketing

167
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,529
knew where I saw these one in their
corner was a girl using one of these

168
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:37,200
areas so basically it's it this this
this thing is getting your brainwaves

169
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,010
I'm according to Europe to your focusing
labor or relax label

170
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,220
serious move or European moves and it's
connected to the geolocation if you're

171
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,750
angry or sad they take your June during
your location based on brain waves and

172
00:17:53,750 --> 00:18:01,840
this is these companies having good
success now we're in there but with

173
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,639
Egypt beta basically matching people
with eg brain waves I had the chance to

174
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,520
talk with this guy

175
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,139
the the the CEO the creator we had a
quick conversation on the email

176
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,950
interview and algorithms that they're
using to do the matching stuff are

177
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,320
amazing

178
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,860
lot of interesting stuff surfers in
mexico using their brain waves for

179
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:38,389
research these companies using your data
to the cloud for research purposes as

180
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:45,220
well so you've seen it it's being
adopted every word in many uses military

181
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:53,220
use research blah blah blah but this is
what I want to talk about now the

182
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,840
security aspect the security they are
the attack scenarios what can you do if

183
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,309
you can see some rain date in the wire
you can do replay attacks for example if

184
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,270
you were able to intercept the traffic
from the computer controlling a drone

185
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,340
and if there is no security mechanisms
in between you can save a copy to your

186
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,039
computer and later on you can Cindy same
data to the drone or to the processes or

187
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:26,408
I don't know he's just an idea right
this is just conception now or if you're

188
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,279
in the network of a hospital and the
cerebellar receiving the brain waves

189
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,950
let's say that the research

190
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:40,740
patient and the recent are your top
secret at accurate inside the hospital

191
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:47,570
network week can they be spread word of
mouth right let's say they bring

192
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:53,260
activity was resulted in a normal
behavior what if this guy go on a date

193
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:59,658
this information with really wrong they
are not having schizophrenia I don't

194
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:05,590
know what about instead of creating
hundreds or thousands of emails for

195
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,620
spamming purposive purposes

196
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:14,189
trading eg tater for a new marketing
their different scenarios that I see

197
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:21,419
here I told you before he's hard to
achieve white basically because you need

198
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,529
to understand environment is not very
easy to sail again going to capture this

199
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:31,100
packet and I'm going to replace these
back later to move the car to the right

200
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,510
you need to understand all the
environment the technology's becoming to

201
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:41,899
understand what products are being used
the file formats to protocols by to move

202
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:49,879
in went in what extent is very hard to
understand it these special expertise is

203
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,570
required and with special expertise I
mean electroencephalography however it's

204
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:03,570
feasible and I'm show you some
demonstrations now these from here to

205
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,490
the bestest just

206
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:12,120
introductory stuff from here is what I
saw for the last 10 my research I found

207
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,928
that most of the products

208
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:17,830
sorry

209
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,970
I found that just a few products of them
they mention the security wars they

210
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,100
mentioned they implement authentication
they mentioned they increased the data

211
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,158
like for example these guys from new
room or they're sending the date to

212
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,519
unnecessary channel which you know at
least this is not included in cleartext

213
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:43,649
however I didn't find the classic
security key words that we look for in

214
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:51,479
technical specifications like creeped
out indication security passwords in

215
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,649
ninety percent of the man was the right
right right checked and I spent weeks

216
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:07,768
doing this thing and the interesting
thing is when you use tcp/ip as your

217
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:12,269
communication protocol by the same
disappear Peterson include any security

218
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:15,529
mechanism right and if you put your data
on it

219
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:21,500
your application layer number seven on
it without authentication encryption or

220
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,980
whatever it's the same is still
vulnerable and I'm going to show you if

221
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:34,450
you go to look for some products for new
PCP port you will find many different

222
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,380
products 444 days for example this
product

223
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:47,940
brain lesion regular real-time analyses
receive over the network disappeared

224
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:55,970
directly from their record they're all
these guys obtaining bring waves from

225
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:02,789
the in the Himalayas and sending eat to
the software were BBC born every PC on

226
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:09,399
the network or these other guys new
electric sneak that say the software can

227
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:17,768
be remotely commanded listenin this TCP
port 1235 for incoming connections and

228
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:22,830
you can start streaming stop the
streaming and start and stop stimulation

229
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,139
and

230
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,380
we have another example here all this
information was taken from the brochures

231
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:35,570
from the technical specification right
once they date is really just connect to

232
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:42,740
the port and you will get their data
streaming in this format channel one

233
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,290
channel in every channel use one
electrode and the bites the four bytes

234
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,780
for more information

235
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,020
there are some library software
libraries are being used more and more

236
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,720
in our nation this preacher projects
like this one is being supported

237
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,100
different programming languages but
still the same I went through these

238
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,310
libraries very quickly to check their
the day sending and receiving routines

239
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:16,270
of rain data and are sending the daytime
in binary format so no encryption

240
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:22,950
security in their demonstration in the
following demonstration I'm I'm going to

241
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:31,620
use new receiver basically over the
transceiver using tcp/ip and PDF format

242
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:40,189
I will explain later this month in
Palestine news for research purposes

243
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:47,550
anything close them bringing page which
is pretty babe is it a more recent so

244
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:52,669
far but still using these old code and
it's full of women religious is full of

245
00:24:52,670 --> 00:25:00,740
flaws I will show you what I'm going to
do the next then I'm going to sniff my

246
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:08,030
brain signals doing a classic many black
men in the middle means one computer

247
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,480
personal computing computer sending
information there is an attacker in

248
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,250
between that companies they are tables
so he can get a copy can intercept the

249
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,570
data right

250
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:40,389
remembered the acquisition devices these
1 ratio you it will be connected to the

251
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,990
Windows computer and it will be sending
my brain waves to the eg server it

252
00:25:45,990 --> 00:30:14,690
disappeared on machine computer named
idea right

253
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:40,190
to the New York AP this is this is the
patient device

254
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:48,680
election from the kind and I will start
sending so are we sending thousands of

255
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,170
packets

256
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:54,970
eg package and we can see here in the
summer new awesome receive disconnection

257
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:10,090
from Ali Khan and is receiving thousands
having a copy these the attacker a

258
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:22,409
malicious user on the network he's
receiving my brain waves what happened

259
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,880
what would happen if there is no
encryption in between right to bring

260
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:32,990
these values are important in every
technology their own specific format you

261
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:44,020
need to know what protocols and so this
is what happens when there is no

262
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:58,720
option however we know rain cloud we
don't know yet with there should be some

263
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:08,020
assessments now if we talk about
integration integration process of

264
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:17,230
determining whether someone or something
is one occasion mechanisms between these

265
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:26,410
things these devices and the other ends
December and the EU server and the drama

266
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:31,130
or the car or the processes there should
be something that the processes or

267
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:31,990
whatever it is

268
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:40,780
things like a I'm receiving eg data is
this supposed or are they coming from

269
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,610
the trusted source this is basically
indication there should be something

270
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:51,020
between in this problem

271
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:56,940
there is no indication and I'm going to
show you another name with this same

272
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,760
scenario but in this case I will not
only be sniffing the men in the middle

273
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,060
of the pack will be catching the
information I will be replacing some of

274
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:19,810
these data from these devices using the
patient named Alejandro et cetera for

275
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:25,480
demonstration purposes change only might
ask you baby and handed the ASCII

276
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:34,810
characters but it could be anything but
from there from the streaming right

277
00:33:34,810 --> 00:38:49,319
computer

278
00:38:49,319 --> 00:39:36,479
basically there would be a real shame
the route over there and imagine this is

279
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:43,509
becoming real time in a critical
situation there comes the attacker

280
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:57,500
sending 1,000 connections to the TCP
port

281
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:10,180
connections and so then it stops
December dies so no their clients will

282
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:17,700
be able to connect to the server because
he already crashed so these technologies

283
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:29,839
in my opinion he used to send them in
just the basics can and the appeals

284
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:42,180
these industrial components that I think
exactly the same here I did the same

285
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:49,009
thing these products new electrics

286
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:58,030
product is a basic C code to breathe

287
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:04,690
over here nearly proved to be redeemed
and after a while no more connections

288
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:10,070
connections

289
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:22,100
manually connection refused and yes the
application and there are many many many

290
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,680
flaws

291
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:35,859
12 this file format PDF application
international format to encode your

292
00:41:35,860 --> 00:42:46,060
brainwaves who brings you create a model
for me and you send it to a new level

293
00:42:46,060 --> 00:43:01,750
entertained eg growth sending my
formative Heather and should be now and

294
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:09,610
yes the center which is should be alive
he's just crashed is a beautiful session

295
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:17,750
they're just don't like this there are
so many of them so many I found this one

296
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:27,840
this is basically an array of blind
structures 16 months klein's but every

297
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,550
time there is a new connection there is
no validation of these counter area just

298
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:37,900
counting more and more and more and now
after dinner they they have the index

299
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,650
they're referencing this index here
through ma'am said they're putting this

300
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:51,920
memory area 20 so basically says invalid
memory the reference and that means that

301
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:59,460
if you create a lot of sockets you will
get the beautiful except segmentation

302
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:07,670
fault and you can see the memory trying
to put the SERO and I will watch this

303
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:10,120
topic very quickly I only 15 minutes

304
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,680
babble of eg file formats the doctors
physicians when they share information

305
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:22,089
about their patients there they share
this information in file formats Howard

306
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:27,170
will bring waves including this file
formats I would say that is like any any

307
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:32,910
other file formats JPG PDF whatever
Indian these data and metadata to

308
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:39,240
understand this information right so the
problem here is there are so many

309
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:44,899
proprietary file formats every vendor is
creating their own file format their own

310
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,930
technology their own interpretation
there and this is a problem because in

311
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,450
the old times there was a problem

312
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,779
a compatibility problem between
hospitals and doctors right

313
00:44:54,779 --> 00:45:04,630
this is why 92 2003 they created ETF
like a standard file format so it took

314
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:10,130
me weeks to go through brochures manuals
specifications to create these stable

315
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:15,979
what I did I looked on the internet the
bender named the product name software

316
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:23,658
and I both different console they
supported file format and in the end

317
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:29,469
result is that most of them have their
own proprietary file format and EVF so I

318
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:38,519
decided to play a little bit with EDF
EDF just as I said bite and a bunch of

319
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:43,908
bytes error parsing an embarrassing you
will find the same problems as any other

320
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:48,529
kind of stuff you will find before
overflows memory corruption romantic

321
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:56,709
calculations but this is Barry
unexplored file format you know the the

322
00:45:56,709 --> 00:46:02,489
attack scenarios here the attack surface
barrier reducibility specialized 445

323
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:07,959
format the bad guys are not going to
exploit before of this kind of stuff

324
00:46:07,959 --> 00:46:11,598
because only the physicians are in
neurosciences they have these kind of

325
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:18,849
suffering but still it's just for fun if
you're learning exploitation and buffer

326
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:22,630
overflows enforcing you can play a
little bit with this software and you

327
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:32,219
will find a lot of information here
they're using insecure functions so you

328
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:36,509
save time aidid table forcing just
basically platform opposing using their

329
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:43,589
father of a friend or co-worker mangled
I the simple statistic cases I use my

330
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:48,640
own brain signals saving and media
format and I don't know that some of

331
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:55,288
them from some other race from this unit
facilities database of psychological

332
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:59,130
signals so you can download there an
opening your reviewer in your browser

333
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:05,150
you can corrupt these files to open
later in your applications so Indian

334
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,660
they this is my forcing

335
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:12,140
journal I create disarmament my test
cases they force the force of the right

336
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:20,150
used how many bytes specifically
selected from the Heather percent cases

337
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,230
and it was very easy to find

338
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:27,510
like many boxing difference of I don't
have time to show you some some of the

339
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:32,250
most but I found some flaws in this
commercial this is commercial the other

340
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:38,650
ones are open source software but I like
kind of famous in hospitals and

341
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:49,560
physicians you can find many ppl 410 and
Evers there and there are some other

342
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,529
interesting as

343
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:56,880
aspects like my brain waves were going
back and forth story from the computer

344
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:04,950
right there are some other options that
use wifi what about putting you know

345
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:10,899
like some Jamison who are putting a
general between the car under drawn

346
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,250
being controlled by the brain waves you
know this this kind of things are

347
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:22,740
interesting I went to show them and I
found that these people saving bring

348
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:29,069
we've seen in shareholders their
password protected but still very using

349
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:36,130
them for storing bring weeks chillin on
remote desktop I found this whole

350
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:41,510
solution which worry which was
implemented in three computers computer

351
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:45,810
and monitor station and yes they are
accessible through the Internet of

352
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,900
Things

353
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:54,290
internet the brain waves or whatever and
supported by the beautiful windows xp

354
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,680
there is a lot of

355
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,549
security researcher still being don't
know what they say about brain waves

356
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:10,569
stuff we need to talk more about privacy
who is in charge of feet guidelines I

357
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:14,480
went to this website American clinical
neurophysiology society and I found

358
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:21,619
guidelines recommended best practices
and stuff and they're kind of all in one

359
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:26,430
of them is going mines for recording
clinical EEG on digital media to use

360
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:34,230
magnet magnetic storage rooms and stuff
that is it's very old so conclusions we

361
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:39,450
need to put more security wing which is
when we designed this product if you are

362
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:45,980
a researcher and you're using EEG
Technologies Inc insecurity as well if

363
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,230
you're controlling some critical stuff
there and the technology is not

364
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:55,059
supporting security itself you can put
some are workarounds like to sell

365
00:49:55,059 --> 00:50:05,520
tonelson between so you can avoid some
stuff we need more secure programming we

366
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,869
need more file formats standardization
if you like to play as I told you before

367
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:14,650
with security vulnerabilities I'm
forcing and stuff do you have a new

368
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:22,150
terror into plane with networking and
applications try your test your medical

369
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:31,180
devices and so far for them do some
security checks and

370
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:37,520
for future research for those who want
to scan the internet which seemed up a

371
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:44,920
good bandwidth time to play with I'm
pretty sure there are many devices

372
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,450
connected there in the internet all you
need is time and I would bandwidth and

373
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:55,078
you know a set of specific IP addresses
like research centers or universities

374
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:02,630
are unable to find and yes perhaps in
the future like now there's no other

375
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:09,770
safety appliances for industrial
networks during deep packet inspectors

376
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:16,540
for the layer 7 for example the inside
the network back it to tell you a DS

377
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:22,279
models packet is corrupted this model's
TCP packet these militias I think in the

378
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,839
future there could be some things like
this in hospitals like for like let's

379
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,180
say a bias singles final nowadays
worries there is their file firewalls

380
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:40,770
implementing dpi you ask why not for
bill things in the future for this kind

381
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,900
of file formats for this kind of
protocols we don't know

382
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:51,440
well thank you if you have any questions
or something you can ask me in the party

383
00:51:51,440 --> 00:52:02,299
with a beer in hand and we can discuss
and thank you so much I hope you like it

384
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:18,830
but if there is any question now

385
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:37,400
actually the guys from my research
company based in Barcelona I send an

386
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:43,810
email to them but they never replied I
don't know where they reply after two

387
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:48,759
weeks or something I told him I found
some issues in Europe product this is a

388
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:55,550
way how you should fix it but they
replay two weeks later in the program

389
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:01,090
thank you so much for reporting these
issues for tours we're going to patch it

390
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:07,460
later but what I feel is that these
these companies are not aware of

391
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:13,500
security things are not aware of the of
the vulnerability disclosure programs

392
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,210
and stuff like that so I'm pretty sure
that internally in the company there

393
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:22,330
were like a waitress a guy who will
present political force in Las Vegas or

394
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:26,990
something what do we do now what's
happening now but these races Pacific

395
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:32,490
Lee they acted well from the other
products are you sending their exploits

396
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,180
they prefer concepts to the internet
because it's very easy to purchase open

397
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:41,950
source software so it's it's easy to
pass and yeah the commercial product I

398
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:51,710
would say that was the only one other
question

399
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:57,540
all right thank you thank you
